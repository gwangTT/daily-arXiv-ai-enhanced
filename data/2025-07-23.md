### [1] [From Reasoning to Super-Intelligence: A Search-Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15865)
*Shai Shalev-Shwartz,Amnon Shashua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new learning paradigm, Diligent Learner, to address the weaknesses of existing methods in CoT reasoning, including challenges like distribution drift, lack of search mechanisms, and high inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs struggle with complex tasks due to theoretical gaps and practical issues such as distribution drift, lack of search, and exponential inference costs.

Method: The Diligent Learner models reasoning as a depth-first search method, guided by a validator and employs backtracking to rectify failures.

Result: Under mild assumptions, the Diligent Learner shows efficiency in learning from CoT data while overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: Diligent Learner sets a foundation for scalable and reliable reasoning systems, fostering the development of robust and interpretable Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing
the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and
existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --
often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles
that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of
embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent
Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a
depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon
failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent
Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do
so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable
reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the
way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust,
interpretable problem-solving abilities.

### [2] [Purchase and Production Optimization in a Meat Processing Plant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15866)
*Marek Vlk,Premysl Sucha,Jaroslaw Rudy,Radoslaw Idzikowski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing meat production in the EU amidst challenges like the energy crisis, introducing a novel integer linear programming approach for efficient processing under complex constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The meat production sector faces increasing challenges, particularly from an energy crisis in the European Union. Efficient material use is critical for profitability, prompting the need for advanced optimization methods.

Method: The authors address a material processing optimization problem with constraints such as minimum order quantity and alternative material processing methods. They apply an iterative integer linear programming approach which avoids numerical issues and works with real-life instances.

Result: The proposed algorithm efficiently solves the optimization problem using real data from a meat processing company, finding optimal solutions within seconds for all tested cases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of a tailored optimization algorithm for meat production challenges, offering a robust solution for industry-specific constraints.

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces
many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the
energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input
materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This
paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent
material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the
majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns
supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The
problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock
of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely
neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the
minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints
makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple
iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve
real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming
solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical
issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a
commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat
processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a
few seconds for all considered use cases.

### [3] [Why Braking? Scenario Extraction and Reasoning Utilizing LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15874)
*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Vivek Subramanian,Ahmed Abouelazm,Robin Bohn,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and classify driving scenarios, specifically focusing on braking events in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of identifying safety-critical driving scenarios, emphasizing braking events, within the vast dataset of routine ADAS driving data.

Method: Employing a framework based on LLMs to bridge numerical signals with natural language descriptions, the study employs dual-path scenario retrieval for known and unknown driving situations.

Result: Experiments on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework surpasses rule-based methods and effectively handles Out-of-Distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The method provides a significant improvement in understanding and retrieving safety-critical driving events in complex urban environments, aided by innovative application of LLMs.

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

### [4] [Differential Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15875)
*Jerry Li,Timothy Oh,Joseph Hoang,Vardhit Veeramachaneni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Differential Attention to text-vision models to reduce noise and hallucinations, showing its effectiveness in improving information retrieval and question-answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models are efficient but struggle with added modalities like vision, which increase noise and limit context understanding.

Method: Fine-tuning the PaliGemma 3B model with Differential Attention using LoRA, testing different configurations.

Result: Differential Attention successfully mitigates noise and improves information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

Conclusion: Integrating Differential Attention into fine-tuning of models effectively enhances performance when dealing with noisy multi-modal contexts.

Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their
efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional
modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context
windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer
attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In
this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed
for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to
evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce
hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,
incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter
settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be
adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy
information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

### [5] [Re-evaluating Short- and Long-Term Trend Factors in CTA Replication: A Bayesian Graphical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15876)
*Eric Benhamou,Jean-Jacques Ohana,Alban Etienne,Béatrice Guez,Ethan Setrouk,Thomas Jacquot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the relative merits of short-term versus long-term trend-following strategies employed by Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the ongoing debate about the effectiveness and interplay of short-term and long-term trend-following systems.

Method: The authors utilize a Bayesian graphical model to dynamically decompose CTA returns into short-term trend, long-term trend, and market beta factors.

Result: The analysis reveals how the mix of short and long-term horizons influences the risk-adjusted performance of CTAs' strategies.

Conclusion: A better understanding of trend horizon blending can optimize CTA strategies and clarify their performance dynamics.

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following
rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that
capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in
fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the
relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain
controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA
returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a
Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the
strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in the ARC-AGI Domain: Comparing Execution-Guided Neural Program Synthesis and Test-Time Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15877)
*Simon Ouellette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comparison of neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning in an open-world domain shows neural synthesis excels at creating new solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate compositional generalization, especially out-of-distribution generalization, in an open-world setting.

Method: Controlled experiments in an ARC-AGI domain comparing neural program synthesis with test-time fine-tuning techniques.

Result: Execution-guided neural program synthesis surpassed all reference algorithms in composing novel solutions.

Conclusion: Neural program synthesis is highly effective for compositional tasks, while TTFT primarily leverages in-distribution knowledge.

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI
domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize
out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We
compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this
experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms
all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our
empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly
in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on
directly.

### [7] [The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15880)
*Andy E. Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP), explaining how reasoning systems need structural consistency to function effectively, especially at scale, through a Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragility in coherence as reasoning systems grow more complex and ensure semantic consistency across recursive layers.

Method: The researchers formally introduced RCP and the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) with six internal and external functions to maintain semantic coherence and evaluate recursively across systems.

Result: The study demonstrates that systems without FMI experience coherence breakdown, leading to issues like misalignment and hallucinations in AI systems.

Conclusion: RCP and FMI offer crucial structural guidelines for maintaining coherent intelligence, shifting focus from behavioral constraints to structural alignment for scalable and robust AI systems.

Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural
coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex
systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures
semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle
(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order
N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic
coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator
that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this
coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system
can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We
formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known
operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,
composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,
adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions
(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving
semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any
system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it
scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and
instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other
foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics
needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under
recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift
from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for
safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

### [8] [ADEPTS: A Capability Framework for Human-Centered Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15885)
*Pierluca D'Oro,Caley Drooff,Joy Chen,Joseph Tighe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADEPTS, a framework of core user-facing capabilities for designing AI agents, aiming to bridge the gap between user experience and technical development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of unified guidance for human-centered AI agent development that integrates UX, engineering, and ethical considerations.

Method: ADEPTS defines six principles for human-centered agent design, which emphasize minimal, user-facing capabilities for AI agents to ensure understandability, controllability, and trustworthiness.

Result: ADEPTS provides actionable, compact guidance for teams across research, design, engineering, and policy to create better user-centric AI agents.

Conclusion: The ADEPTS framework has the potential to streamline the development of user-relevant AI agent capabilities, enhance user experience, and foster a shared language for discussing progress in AI agent development.

Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,
assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This
flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and
cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the
capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current
guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics
focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal
pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no
concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should
fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework
defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance
around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for
human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities
an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and
trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and
taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical
and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex
AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI
researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe
ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent
capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those
capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress
around the development of AI agents.

### [9] [Integrating Reason-Based Moral Decision-Making in the Reinforcement Learning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15895)
*Lisa Dargasz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reason-Based Artificial Moral Agents (RBAMAs), which are an extension of reinforcement learning designed to ensure agents behave ethically by learning a reason-theory for moral decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address ethical concerns surrounding autonomous artificial agents transitioning to real-world environments, emphasizing the need for these systems to behave morally.

Method: RBAMAs are developed by extending reinforcement learning architecture to include normative reasoning. The agents learn moral obligations via case-based feedback and adapt their behaviors accordingly.

Result: The study presents the first implementation of an RBAMA and initial experiments showcasing their potential to act ethically and meet moral standards.

Conclusion: RBAMAs offer a deployable framework that supports ethical decision-making and enhances moral robustness and trustworthiness in artificial moral agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has
demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it
plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As
these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly
approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid
robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes
to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises
concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the
requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research
directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave
ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a
range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents
(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning
architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative
reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn
a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant
propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They
are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these
obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute
to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and
their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a
concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key
ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and
demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

### [10] [Advancing Responsible Innovation in Agentic AI: A study of Ethical Frameworks for Household Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15901)
*Joydeep Chandra,Satyam Kumar Navneet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines ethical challenges in using AI for household automation, focusing on vulnerable groups and offering design guidelines for fairness, privacy, and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address ethical challenges and provide responsible design frameworks for integrating proactive autonomous AI agents into household environments.

Method: The paper reviews responsible innovation frameworks, human-centered design principles, governance standards, and studies vulnerable user groups' needs and risks. It uses insights like social media analysis through NLP to inform ethical AI design.

Result: Design imperatives such as explainability, consent mechanisms, and override controls are highlighted, supported by participatory and inclusive design processes.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines and conceptual foundations are provided for developing transparent, inclusive, and ethical agentic AI for household environments.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments,
especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about
possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or
extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its
applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy,
privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation
frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to
distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user
groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face
higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in
context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored
explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls,
supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored
how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language
Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This
survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for
developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household
automation.

### [11] [Does More Inference-Time Compute Really Help Robustness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15974)
*Tong Wu,Chong Xiang,Jiachen T. Wang,Weichen Yu,Chawin Sitawarin,Vikash Sehwag,Prateek Mittal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies inference-time scaling in smaller open-source reasoning models and identifies key vulnerabilities when reasoning steps are accessible to adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether smaller open-source reasoning models can benefit from inference-time computational scaling and to analyze associated security risks.

Method: The authors used a budget forcing strategy to scale computational inference for small open-source models, and critically evaluated security risks by relaxing assumptions about hidden reasoning steps.

Result: Inference-time computation boosts robustness in models under controlled assumptions, but exposing intermediate reasoning steps can reduce robustness due to an inverse scaling law.

Conclusion: Inference-time scaling is beneficial but presents security risks, especially if intermediate reasoning chains are accessible. Deployments should carefully assess these trade-offs in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time
computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this
paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1,
Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a
simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically
examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are
hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important
security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse
scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,
increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.
Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning
chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated
reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively
demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend
heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge
practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying
inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

### [12] [Micromobility Flow Prediction: A Bike Sharing Station-level Study via Multi-level Spatial-Temporal Attention Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16020)
*Xi Yang,Jiachen Wang,Song Han,Suining He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BikeMAN, a neural network designed to predict bike station-level demand and supply in urban bike sharing systems by utilizing spatio-temporal attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban bike sharing systems face inefficiencies due to unbalanced station-level demand and supply, requiring improved predictive methodologies to enhance system management.

Method: The authors employ a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network comprising an encoder-decoder structure to model spatial and temporal patterns in bike station traffic data.

Result: Using data from over 10 million bike trips in New York City, the proposed model successfully predicts station-level traffic for over 700 bike stations with high accuracy.

Conclusion: BikeMAN demonstrates its potential in optimizing urban bike sharing systems by addressing spatial-temporal complexities and providing accurate traffic predictions.

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is
challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes
the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have
been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and
return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level
traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of
bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike
sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.
To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention
neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing
systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an
attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of
bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the
temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on
over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York
City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic
of all stations in the city.

### [13] [From Logic to Language: A Trust Index for Problem Solving with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16028)
*Tehseen Rug,Felix Böhmer,Tessa Pfattheicher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper contrasts classical computation with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a framework to address problems defined by ambiguity and subjectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand and frame the differences between formal logical systems and natural language-based problem-solving in the computational domain.

Method: The paper introduces a unified framework, including a vector-valued trust index Q and two statistical quality metrics, to evaluate solutions from LLMs.

Result: It provides statistical measures, such as normalized bi-semantic entropy and emotional valence metrics, enabling the quantification of robustness and conceptual diversity in LLM outputs.

Conclusion: The paper lays the groundwork for a more rigorous assessment of LLM capabilities, limitations, and their distinct problem-solving paradigm.

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the
engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be
described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean
of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,
and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to
engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This
paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these
problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces
addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the
former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter
requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking
into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural
language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects
solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions
from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language
solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality
dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual
diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.
Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable
metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts
introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the
capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of
LLMs.

### [14] [A Unifying Framework for Semiring-Based Constraint Logic Programming With Negation (full version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16067)
*Jeroen Spaans,Jesse Heyninck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) by introducing negation in the body of clauses, providing semantics via approximation fixpoint theory to develop a unifying framework for handling constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of research on incorporating negation in the body of clauses within extensions of CLP and to unify various generalizations using the semiring abstraction.

Method: The authors use approximation fixpoint theory to define semantics for CLP programs with negation and analyze the impact of semiring properties on these semantics.

Result: A unifying framework was developed that accommodates existing approaches and extends them with a more expressive language for constraints and negation.

Conclusion: The paper successfully provides a unified theoretical basis for combining negation and various extensions of CLP under a semiring-based approach, enabling broader application and expressiveness.

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to
solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource
allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been
extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint
satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring
being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these
extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We
investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and
allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the
framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the
impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we
provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows
extending them with a more expressive language.

Conclusion: This paper highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning, establishing ChatBattery as a successful platform for complex materials innovation in batteries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to
tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in
artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have
primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their
potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely
unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided
search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates
domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials
design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and
characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve
practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over
the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this
discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and
reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete
AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the
transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials
discovery.

*Michael R. Bock,Kara Molisee,Zachary Ozer,Sumit Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaxCalcBench to evaluate AI's ability to calculate US personal income taxes, finding current models ineffective with significant errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax calculation is complex due to vast amounts of legal text and precise computation requirements. The paper aims to examine whether AI can reliably perform this task.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark, TaxCalcBench, which tests model proficiency in calculating simplified federal income tax returns.

Result: State-of-the-art models currently succeed in calculating less than one-third of tax returns, encountering issues such as misusing tax tables and errors in eligibility determination.

Conclusion: Reliable AI tax calculation requires additional infrastructure and development to overcome current limitations in accuracy and domain-specific understanding.

Abstract: Can AI file your taxes? Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a
task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text
and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench,
a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax
returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that
state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal
income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes
that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and
incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for
additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation
task.

### [17] [SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145)
*Shuhao Mei,Yongchao Long,Shan Cao,Xiaobo Han,Shijia Geng,Jinbo Sun,Yuxi Zhou,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces SpiroLLM, a multimodal large language model for COPD diagnosis using spirogram data, achieving high diagnostic accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for COPD diagnosis lack interpretability, and large language models (LLMs) are unable to process spirogram data, limiting clinical trust and utility.

Method: The authors developed SpiroLLM by integrating respiratory curve features (via SpiroEncoder) and pulmonary function test (PFT) values (via SpiroProjector) into a unified latent space, enabling comprehensive diagnostic report generation.

Result: SpiroLLM achieved a high diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 and demonstrated robustness in handling missing core data with a 100% valid response rate, outperforming text-only models.

Conclusion: SpiroLLM showcases the potential of combining physiological signals with LLMs for interpretable and reliable clinical decision support, setting a benchmark for future advancements.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

### [18] [Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind (A Position Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Agentic Flow," an AI agent architecture with structural convergence across four cognitive theories of mind, demonstrating enhancements in multi-step reasoning tasks compared to baseline LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in large language models and explore how practical AI designs might unintentionally align with cognitive theories.

Method: Developed "Agentic Flow" architecture comprising modules like Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action, arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Conducted experiments with multi-step reasoning tasks against LLM baselines.

Result: "Agentic Flow" achieved 95.8% success in reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline LLM systems with 62.3% success, showing strong constraint adherence.

Conclusion: Instead of claiming theoretical unification, the paper suggests that practical designs can unintentionally echo structural motifs of cognitive theories, introducing PEACE as a meta-architecture to frame such design regularities.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential
theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive
processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging
unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow.
Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow
comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control,
Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally
inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively
aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including
predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with
baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent
achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while
the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed
at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may
emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures
design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new
theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures
shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a
position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface
latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical
unification.

*Li-Hsiang Shen,Jyun-Jhe Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced SAGIN architecture using multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) to enhance energy efficiency by addressing satellite energy shortages through optimized parameters and a novel learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome energy shortages in low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites within shadowed regions while improving communication and computational energy efficiency in SAGIN systems.

Method: Developed a joint optimization solution focusing on MF-RIS and SAGIN parameters and proposed a CHIMERA framework for efficient exploration using hybrid reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the CHIMERA framework's superior energy efficiency against benchmarks, including various RIS configurations and reinforcement learning methodologies.

Conclusion: The SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture supported by CHIMERA framework offers significant EE advantages through integrated space, air, and ground functionalities compared to standalone deployments.

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address economic and accessibility gaps in digital healthcare, especially for underserved populations, by exploring voice-based AI assistants' potential as an equitable solution.

Method: The paper involved the development and pilot testing of Agent PULSE with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients, alongside a detailed cost-utility analysis and examination of technical and policy challenges.

Result: The pilot study showed 70% acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37% preferring it over traditional systems. The economic model highlighted significant cost savings and improved scalability.

Conclusion: Voice-based AI agents can enhance healthcare efficiency and accessibility. By addressing technical and ethical challenges, they may provide a sustainable solution for equitable healthcare delivery.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a
transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital
health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model
(LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous
patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights
from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and
Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an
economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective
healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our
pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\%
expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over
traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time
conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy
compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding
regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that
AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency
but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare
executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for
routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to
prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing
current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory
frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for
equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

*Dong Ben,Hui Feng,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the feasibility of using lightweight LLMs within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for secure semiconductor CAD tasks, highlighting performance gains with distilled and quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect intellectual property (IP) associated with LLMs and training data in circuit design tasks from exposure using secure computations.

Method: Comprehensive performance evaluation of lightweight LLMs in TEE-enabled environments utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX), comparisons across TEE, CPU, and CPU-GPU implementations.

Result: Distilled models such as DeepSeek surpass others in performance for resource-constrained systems. Quantized models achieve up to a 3x performance gain compared to FP16. TDX implementation shows better efficiency for smaller models like DeepSeek-r1-1.5B.

Conclusion: Efficient deployment of lightweight LLMs like DeepSeek on resource-limited systems within TEEs is feasible, particularly for secure semiconductor CAD applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks
and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained
models and their associated training data are considered confidential
intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential
Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations
are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.
In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a
TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel
Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three
environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and
evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other
models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for
resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit
quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain
of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer
parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms
the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We
further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.
These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying
lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD
applications.

*Bo Hou,Xin Tan,Kai Zheng,Fang Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents ColaUntangle, a framework using LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration to untangle tangled code commits by modeling explicit and implicit dependencies, outperforming prior methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tangled commits negatively impact code review and maintenance, and existing commit untangling methods often fail to distinguish between explicit and implicit dependencies in code.

Method: ColaUntangle employs a multi-agent architecture with LLM-driven agents specializing in explicit and implicit dependencies. It uses multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG) for deep reasoning over code.

Result: ColaUntangle outperformed the best baseline methods by 44% on a C# dataset and 100% on a Java dataset, showing significant improvements in untangling commits.

Conclusion: LLM-based collaborative frameworks, like ColaUntangle, hold significant promise for improving automation in commit untangling tasks by effectively addressing explicit and implicit code dependencies.

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a
best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce
tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or
unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although
prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,
have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish
between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones
(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose
ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling
that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.
ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a
multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,
another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives
through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual
information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),
enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and
semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#
and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle
outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on
the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit
untangling tasks.

*Shreya Saxena,Siva Prasad,Zishan Ahmad,Vishal Vaddina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACT introduces an automated framework for fine-tuning open-source large language models (LLMs) for code translation, bridging the gap between open and proprietary solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional code translation methods and proprietary LLM solutions, such as inflexibility, scalability challenges, data security, and reliance issues.

Method: Developed ACT, a framework with automated pipelines for fine-tuning open-source LLMs. Introduced synthetic data generation for robust training datasets, execution-level evaluation to ensure translation quality, and a controller module for dynamic optimization of hyperparameters and the training process.

Result: ACT improves the performance of open-source LLMs and has demonstrated success in increasing developer efficiency during industry-scale migration projects.

Conclusion: ACT mitigates the limitations of existing code translation solutions by offering a secure, scalable, and high-performance alternative that empowers businesses and developers relying on open-source tools.

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in
developer acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI systems mainly focus on their ability for web retrieval and report generation, neglecting their potential in scientific discovery and frontier research.

Method: The study introduced ResearcherBench, leveraging a dataset of 65 real-world scientific questions spanning 35 AI topics and evaluated using a dual framework—rubric assessment and factual assessment.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep Research demonstrated superior performance on open-ended consulting queries and citation faithfulness compared to other systems.

Conclusion: ResearcherBench establishes a fresh standard for evaluating AI systems as scientific collaborators and aims to foster advancements in AI research tools for innovative collaboration patterns.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in
problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks.
However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web
retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel
insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we
introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the
capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI
Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a
dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific
scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different
AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature
review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric
assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality,
with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and
coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and
baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep
Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in
open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step
toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We
open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting
the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a

*Cairong Zhao,Yufeng Jin,Zifan Song,Haonan Chen,Duoqian Miao,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge through cross-modal distillation and proposes strategies to mitigate overfitting between differing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of increasing model size in deep learning by exploring multi-modal learning and knowledge transfer techniques.

Method: The authors propose soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature and classifier levels, coupled with a quality-based adaptive weighting module.

Result: Experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks demonstrate effective knowledge transfer across diverse modalities like image, text, and speech.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal distillation framework successfully addresses overfitting issues and enables robust multi-modal knowledge transfer during student-teacher model training.

Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or
efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the
model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer
and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited
access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning
by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a
student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via
distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely
differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce
a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained
loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can
easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we
propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature
level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a
quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified
data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on
speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that
our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the
commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Existing medical LLM benchmarks fail to account for African disease burden and regulatory contexts, highlighting the need for region-specific evaluations such as Alama Health QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in medical LLM benchmarks tailored to African healthcare settings, characterized by diseases like malaria, HIV, and TB, as well as reliance on national guidelines.

Method: 31 medical LLM evaluation papers were reviewed to identify benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using Kenyan guidelines and evaluated alongside six sets, analyzing metrics like relevance, guideline alignment, and representation of neglected diseases.

Result: Alama Health QA demonstrated superior representation of neglected diseases and guideline alignment compared to global benchmarks, which often failed to account for African health issues.

Conclusion: Regionally curated benchmarks like Alama Health QA are crucial for fair and accurate evaluation of medical LLMs in African contexts.

Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination
syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about
their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell
disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and
national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31
quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English
medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval
augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,
MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized
semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity
metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,
guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural
fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora
and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB
(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global
benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in
three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for
relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.
Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature
underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking
misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources
such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential
for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of India's Kilkari program by addressing the issues with random scheduling of maternal health voice calls, which leads to reduced message delivery.

Method: A field trial involving around 6500 participants was conducted using a collaborative bandit algorithm to personalize call timing and compare its performance with the existing random scheduling approach.

Result: The bandit algorithm resulted in statistically significant improvements in call pick-up rates compared to the baseline random approach.

Conclusion: Personalized scheduling via machine learning has the potential to significantly improve maternal health outreach at scale, demonstrating its efficacy in mHealth interventions.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
health information, particularly targeting underserved communities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate
crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes
through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program
delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions

individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around
$6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the
baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm,
indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of
mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized
scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of

### [29] [Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models: A Framework for Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16370)
*Lucas de Lara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to represent counterfactuals in causal graphical models using canonical representations, enhancing flexibility without altering observational and interventional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual reasoning is critical in addressing questions about 'what could have been' and underpinning concepts like fairness, but existing models struggle to effectively formalize counterfactual beliefs compatible with causal graphical frameworks.

Method: The authors propose counterfactual models—a canonical representation of structural causal models—using random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals. They also introduce a normalization procedure for implementing various counterfactual conceptions.

Result: This approach enables specifying diverse counterfactual conceptions while preserving observational and interventional constraints, simplifying the integration of counterfactual reasoning into causal analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a versatile framework for counterfactual reasoning that enhances causal analysis without requiring detailed estimation at the counterfactual layer, demonstrated through theoretical and numerical examples.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like
''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the
most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual
statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they
underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore,
providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a
fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal
framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to
represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More
precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical
representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a
counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with
preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of
structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to
describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to
structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions
without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover,
the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not
need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the
specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach
on theoretical and numerical examples.

### [30] [Self-Supervised Inductive Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16405)
*Stassa Patsantzis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Poker," a new inductive logic programming (ILP) system designed to learn recursive programs in scenarios without problem-specific background theories or negative examples, using self-supervised learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning recursive logic programs in scenarios where problem-specific background theories or negative examples are unavailable.

Method: The paper presents Poker, a Prolog-implemented MIL system that generates and labels new positive and negative examples during learning, and introduces a new SONF-based approach for selecting background theories.

Result: Poker outperformed Louise in experiments involving grammar learning tasks, especially when negative examples were unavailable.

Conclusion: Poker offers an effective self-supervised solution to ILP problems, eliminating the dependency on task-specific background knowledge and utilizing automatically generated examples for improved learning flexibility.

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive
Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with
invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability
relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected
with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such
a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We
formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a
new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled,
and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels,
new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm
in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to
state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for
Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no
negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in
examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for
the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order
Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a
class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning
task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of
automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples,
over-generalises.

*Hongyi Tang,Zhihao Zhu,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NA-PDD, a method leveraging differential neuron activation patterns to identify if data was included in training for large language models (LLMs), outperforming existing methods across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face critical issues related to training data, including ethical concerns, biases, and dataset contamination.

Method: The authors developed NA-PDD, an algorithm that analyzes the neuron activation differences between training and non-training data, alongside creating CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark for evaluation.

Result: NA-PDD outperformed existing data detection methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: NA-PDD effectively improves the reliability of pre-training data detection and enhances ethical accountability in LLMs.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their
training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information,
raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for
dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the
Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific
data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD
methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss,
resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a
novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between
training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that
these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also
introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data
transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and
non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly
outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

### [32] [From model-based learning to model-free behaviour with Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16434)
*Stassa Patsantzis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating model-based and model-free methods for autonomous agents and demonstrates their equivalence in navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for autonomous agents that can independently act in novel environments by combining model-based and model-free capabilities.

Method: The researchers use Meta-Interpretive Learning to develop a model-based Solver to train a model-free Controller, evaluating both on grid navigation tasks.

Result: The model-free Controller and model-based Solver show equivalent problem-solving capabilities in navigation tasks across various environments.

Conclusion: Model-based and model-free approaches can be successfully integrated, achieving equivalent performance for solving navigation problems.

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the
effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use
its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but
must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can
act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An
autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must
combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with
Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a
model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver.
We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on
grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes,
and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved
by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are
equivalent.

*Pierangela Bruno,Carmine Dodaro,Giuseppe Galatà,Marco Maratea,Marco Mochi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem by combining machine learning and Answer Set Programming to generate robust, provisional surgery schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve limitations in existing ASP-based scheduling solutions, such as the inability to create provisional schedules and the lack of robustness in the generated schedules.

Method: The approach integrates machine learning techniques to predict surgery durations and uses these predictions, along with their confidence levels, to inform updates to ASP-based scheduling encodings.

Result: The integration demonstrates success on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria hospital in Italy, confirming the approach’s viability.

Conclusion: Combining inductive (machine learning) and deductive (ASP) techniques enhances the robustness and practicality of operating room scheduling, addressing previous limitations effectively.

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of
daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to
many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries
and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in
different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer
Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall
satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify
whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest
alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is
not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the
resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving
these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the
surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,
we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our
problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust
schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm
the viability of our integration.

### [34] [Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473)
*Chang Li,Yaren Zhang,Haoran Lv,Qiong Cao,Chao Xue,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper aims to enhance the efficiency of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing a latent space instead of explicit step-by-step text generation. This is achieved using hierarchical reinforcement learning and a novel algorithm called Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the computational inefficiency and speed limitations of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs by shifting towards an efficient latent reasoning approach.

Method: The authors propose a framework where reasoning occurs in a latent space modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. They introduce the VMOC algorithm for learning diverse latent embeddings and extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms to build a foundation for abstract reasoning. A cold-start procedure is also proposed for initializing this latent space using supervised fine-tuning data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning tasks and locomotion challenges, indicating its effectiveness in learning abstract skills for reasoning and control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a principled and effective method for enabling efficient and implicit reasoning in LLMs, offering robust performance across diverse tasks by leveraging latent spaces and hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step
textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this,
we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the
model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every
step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as
temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of
options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian
Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference
within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these
options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP
homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract
latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the
solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start
procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human
reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich
initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical
reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework
as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and
control.

*Jean Lelong,Adnane Errazine,Annabelle Blangero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The INRAExplorer system improves upon conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by leveraging a multi-tool knowledge graph to handle complex scientific queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems underperform in handling complex queries, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains like scientific research. There is a need for methods that can provide more detailed, structured answers and navigate intricate relationships.

Method: INRAExplorer integrates an LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture, enabling it to interact dynamically with a knowledge graph constructed from INRAE's open-access publications. This allows iterative reasoning and comprehensive data retrieval.

Result: INRAExplorer demonstrates the ability to handle intricate queries by retrieving exhaustive datasets, supporting multi-hop reasoning, and providing structured, detailed results.

Conclusion: The system succeeds in enhancing interaction with specialized scientific data, offering a model for applying advanced RAG techniques to niche research domains.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering
limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or
navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in
knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system
for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an
LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich
knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open
access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct
iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all
publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver
structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete
illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.

TL;DR: The paper assesses risks from advanced AI using a structured Frontier AI Risk Management Framework to categorize threats into zones: green, yellow, and red. No evaluated AI models currently reside in the red zone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand and address risks associated with rapidly advancing AI technologies and their potential to disrupt systems, society, and governance.

Method: The paper uses the E-T-C analysis framework to identify risks and categorizes them in zones (green, yellow, red) based on 'AI-$45^ Law' and indicators like 'red lines' and 'yellow lines'.

Result: Findings reveal most models are in green or yellow risk zones, with varied threat levels across categories such as persuasion/manipulation, self-replication, biological/chemical risks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for collective mitigation efforts and improved threat modeling to prevent AI risks from advancing into intolerable thresholds.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [37] [Novel Multi-Agent Action Masked Deep Reinforcement Learning for General Industrial Assembly Lines Balancing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16635)
*Ali Mohamed Ali,Luca Tirel,Hashim A. Hashim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based framework optimized for industrial assembly line task and resource scheduling using Markov Decision Process modeling, action-masking, and multi-agent methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for optimizing industrial assembly lines often face computational infeasibility for large scenarios (Integer Programming) or yield suboptimal solutions (heuristic methods). This paper seeks to overcome these limitations.

Method: The proposed model uses Markov Decision Process (MDP) to simulate industrial assembly lines and incorporates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with action-masking and multi-agent techniques, allowing decentralized execution with centralized training for better scalability.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrated that the proposed framework achieves faster convergence and superior task/resource scheduling compared to existing model-based methods.

Conclusion: This scalable DRL-based framework improves optimization and efficiency for industrial assembly lines, showing potential for real-world applications to enhance manufacturing standards and operational costs.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly
lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations,
and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges
can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search
space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for
large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also
be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive
cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial
assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing
assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most
existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment
for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and
resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper
proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which
ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training
time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed
by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced.
A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted,
offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly
lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently
provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network
that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating
significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a
comparable model-based approach.

*Amandeep Kaur,Gyan Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize inventory management of agricultural products under demand and lead time uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inventory management in agricultural supply chains faces challenges like seasonal production fluctuation, uncertainty in demand, and lack of coordination among stakeholders. Current methods fail to address these effectively.

Method: The study develops a DRL algorithm combining value- and policy-based approaches, enabling inventory optimization that accounts for perishability, uncertainties, and continuous action spaces.

Result: Empirical tests using real data from fresh agricultural supply chains showed improved inventory management performance under unpredictable demand and lead time conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL algorithm provides a viable solution for optimizing agricultural inventory management while promoting stakeholder collaboration and addressing uncertainty challenges.

Abstract: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in
production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to
these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or
stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level
of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To
bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of
agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing
effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit
throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases
due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes
challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of
solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL
approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed
algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their
interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing
profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,
and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with
continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the
inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the
empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is
considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the
proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and
lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for
policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively
under uncertainty.

Motivation: Real-world deployment of LLMs requires increased reliability, especially in tasks like open-domain question answering.

Abstract: Improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs) is critical for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine for large language models, achieving up to 250x speedups in generating structured outputs like HTML and JSON by precompiling static constraints and optimizing runtime processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structured decoding methods for large language models face efficiency issues due to grammar compilation and state tracking, which impedes performance in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose decomposing constraints into static (precompiled offline) and dynamic (instantiated at runtime) components, and replace pushdown automata with compositional operators to manage regular formats efficiently.

Result: The proposed approach significantly reduces transition latency and achieves performance gains of up to 250x over existing systems through optimizations like domain-aware simplification and mask caching.

Conclusion: wgrammar successfully optimizes structured decoding for large language models, merging efficiency and flexibility, with the source code made accessible for broader use.

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs
in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However,
existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation,
state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed
strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a
decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling
static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using
grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a
compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower
transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that
integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask
caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source
code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

TL;DR: ChatChecker introduces an automated framework to evaluate and test dialogue systems holistically using LLMs to simulate interactions and identify issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue systems often involve LLMs, external tools, and databases, but lack effective integrated testing methods beyond turn-level analysis.

Method: ChatChecker employs LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions, uses error taxonomies for better detection of dialogue breakdowns, and incorporates challenging user personas for non-cooperative evaluation.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved detection of dialogue breakdowns and uncovers weaknesses in systems using challenging personas compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: ChatChecker enables scalable testing, reducing setup efforts and accelerating development of robust dialogue systems for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),
their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers
integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment
of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be
tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With
most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been
paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we
present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of
complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user
interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to
previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as
it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the
implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection
performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in
the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator
based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue
systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and
scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate
the development of robust dialogue systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating uncertainty-aware forecasts with multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current P2P energy trading approaches rely on deterministic forecasts, overlooking stochastic environments and prediction uncertainties that impact decision-making.

Method: They use a probabilistic transformer-based model (Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty) for uncertainty-aware prediction and integrate it with a MARL framework to optimize energy trading.

Result: The method reduced energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% (without P2P) and 3.2% (with P2P), increased electricity sales revenue by 6.4% (without P2P) and 44.7% (with P2P), and reduced peak hour grid demand by 38.8% (without P2P) and 45.6% (with P2P).

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty-aware forecasting with P2P trading mechanisms leads to significant economic and operational improvements in energy communities.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading
that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast
to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach
employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model
called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify
prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the
stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages
domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that
ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each
prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL
framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear
understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the
uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to
5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing
electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak
hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These
improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting
the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,
economically efficient energy communities.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers state-of-the-art performance and energy efficiency for path planning in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Path planning is critical for autonomous driving, generating smooth,
collision-free, feasible paths based on perception and localization inputs.
However, its computationally intensive nature poses significant challenges for
resource-constrained autonomous driving hardware. This paper presents an
end-to-end FPGA-based acceleration framework targeting the quadratic
programming (QP), core of optimization-based path planning. We employ a
hardware-friendly alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for QP
solving and a parallelizable preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method for
linear systems. By analyzing sparse matrix patterns, we propose customized
storage schemes and efficient sparse matrix multiplication units, significantly
reducing resource usage and accelerating matrix operations. Our multi-level
dataflow optimization strategy incorporates intra-operator parallelization and
pipelining, inter-operator fine-grained pipelining, and CPU-FPGA system-level
task mapping. Implemented on the AMD ZCU102 platform, our framework achieves
state-of-the-art latency and energy efficiency, including 1.48x faster
performance than the best FPGA-based design, 2.89x over an Intel i7-11800H CPU,
5.62x over an ARM Cortex-A57 embedded CPU, and 1.56x over a state-of-the-art
GPU solution, along with a 2.05x throughput improvement over existing
FPGA-based designs.

### [44] [Hourglass Sorting: A novel parallel sorting algorithm and its implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16326)
*Daniel Bascones,Borja Morcillo*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel parallel sorting technique for specific cases with parallel input and serial output, achieving $
 +
log{n}$ sorting time without clock speed degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sorting on sequential machines has a lower bound complexity of $
log{n}$. While parallelization reduces sorting times, it increases implementation costs and faces challenges with large input/output data movement. The paper aims to address these bottlenecks in scenarios requiring parallel inputs and serial outputs.

Method: The authors propose a parallel sorting algorithm tailored for cases where input data is parallel but output is serial. The design was implemented on an FPGA and tested within a quantum LDPC decoder context.

Result: The proposed sorter achieves a latency of $
log{n}$ for the first element, with subsequent elements streaming out, resulting in a total sorting time of $
+
log{n}$.

Conclusion: The novel parallel method demonstrated scalability with linear resource requirements and avoided clock speed degradation, making it efficient for parallel-to-serial sorting scenarios.

Abstract: Sorting is one of the fundamental problems in computer science. Playing a
role in many processes, it has a lower complexity bound imposed by
$\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$ when executing on a sequential machine. This limit can
be brought down to sub-linear times thanks to parallelization techniques that
increase the number of comparisons done in parallel. This, however, increases
the cost of implementation, which limits the application of such techniques.
Moreover, as the size of the arrays increases, a bottleneck arises in moving
the vast quantities of data required at the input, and generated at the output
of such sorter. This might impose time requirements much stricter than those of
the sorting itself. In this paper, a novel parallel sorter is proposed for the
specific case where the input is parallel, but the output is serial. The design
is then implemented and verified on an FPGA within the context of a quantum
LDPC decoder. A latency of $\log{n}$ is achieved for the output of the first
element, after which the rest stream out for a total sorting time of
$n+\log{n}$. Contrary to other parallel sorting methods, clock speed does not
degrade with $n$, and resources scale linearly with input size.

*Ondrej Vlcek,Vojtech Mrazek*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ApproxGNN, a pre-trained Graph Neural Network model designed to efficiently predict quality-of-results (QoR) and hardware costs for approximate accelerators, with improved accuracy and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing energy efficiency through approximate computing requires extensive and computationally expensive exploration of circuit designs, highlighting the need for more efficient prediction methods.

Method: The authors devised ApproxGNN, which employs learned embeddings for component feature extraction and is pre-trained to predict QoR and hardware costs, enabling transferability to unseen circuits and reducing retraining needs.

Result: Experimental results revealed that ApproxGNN improves prediction accuracy by 50% (mean square error) compared to traditional methods, and overall prediction accuracy is 30% better than competing ML approaches (54% better with finetuning).

Conclusion: ApproxGNN’s novel embedding-based approach enhances the efficiency of design space exploration in approximate computing, showcasing significant benefits in prediction accuracy and transferability.

Abstract: Approximate computing offers promising energy efficiency benefits for
error-tolerant applications, but discovering optimal approximations requires
extensive design space exploration (DSE). Predicting the accuracy of circuits
composed of approximate components without performing complete synthesis
remains a challenging problem. Current machine learning approaches used to
automate this task require retraining for each new circuit configuration,
making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents
ApproxGNN, a construction methodology for a pre-trained graph neural network
model predicting QoR and HW cost of approximate accelerators employing
approximate adders from a library. This approach is applicable in DSE for
assignment of approximate components to operations in accelerator. Our approach
introduces novel component feature extraction based on learned embeddings
rather than traditional error metrics, enabling improved transferability to
unseen circuits. ApproxGNN models can be trained with a small number of
approximate components, supports transfer to multiple prediction tasks,
utilizes precomputed embeddings for efficiency, and significantly improves
accuracy of the prediction of approximation error. On a set of image
convolutional filters, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
embeddings improve prediction accuracy (mean square error) by 50% compared to
conventional methods. Furthermore, the overall prediction accuracy is 30%
better than statistical machine learning approaches without fine-tuning and 54%
better with fast finetuning.

### [46] [Ironman: Accelerating Oblivious Transfer Extension for Privacy-Preserving AI with Near-Memory Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16391)
*Chenqi Lin,Kang Yang,Tianshi Xu,Ling Liang,Yufei Wang,Zhaohui Chen,Runsheng Wang,Mingyu Gao,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Ironman,' a novel OT accelerator to enhance PPML by optimizing SPCOT and LPN computations, achieving notable latency reductions for CNN and Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing use of machine learning, addressing privacy concerns is critical as user data often involves sensitive information. Existing PPML frameworks are bottlenecked by inefficiencies in the oblivious transfer (OT) computations conducted on CPUs.

Method: Ironman introduces a hardware-optimized SPCOT algorithm for higher computational throughput and a near-memory processing (NMP) architecture with cache and index sorting to improve memory bandwidth for LPN.

Result: Experiments show a 39.2-237.4x improvement in OT throughput and a 2.1-3.4x reduction in PPML latency for CNN and Transformer models.

Conclusion: Ironman significantly enhances PPML framework efficiency by addressing bottlenecks in OT computation, advancing the field of privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: With the wide application of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns arise
with user data as they may contain sensitive information. Privacy-preserving ML
(PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in
which an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a
formal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the
oblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly
involves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning
parity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on
general-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML
frameworks.
  In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to
significantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We
observe that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly
SPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation
throughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular
memory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing
(NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve
effective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman
achieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP
configurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different
PPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end
latency for both CNN and Transformer models.

*Rajpreet Singh,Vidhi Kothari*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computer architecture with a specialized Reasoning Unit (RU) to achieve native AI capabilities, integrating symbolic and neural computing as hardware primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional Von Neumann architectures in supporting artificial general intelligence by embedding reasoning functions directly in hardware.

Method: The architecture integrates a Reasoning Unit (RU) with features like symbolic inference, agent coordination, a specific instruction set, parallel processing, and a unified memory for cognitive tasks.

Result: The proposed architecture enables reasoning, learning, and adaptation as intrinsic machine properties through a hardware-software co-design approach.

Conclusion: The design potentially lays the groundwork for general-purpose intelligent systems by embedding fundamental AI capabilities into the computational infrastructure.

Abstract: This work presents a novel computer architecture that extends the Von Neumann
model with a dedicated Reasoning Unit (RU) to enable native artificial general
intelligence capabilities. The RU functions as a specialized co-processor that
executes symbolic inference, multi-agent coordination, and hybrid
symbolic-neural computation as fundamental architectural primitives. This
hardware-embedded approach allows autonomous agents to perform goal-directed
planning, dynamic knowledge manipulation, and introspective reasoning directly
within the computational substrate at system scale. The architecture
incorporates a reasoning-specific instruction set architecture, parallel
symbolic processing pipelines, agent-aware kernel abstractions, and a unified
memory hierarchy that seamlessly integrates cognitive and numerical workloads.
Through systematic co-design across hardware, operating system, and agent
runtime layers, this architecture establishes a computational foundation where
reasoning, learning, and adaptation emerge as intrinsic execution properties
rather than software abstractions, potentially enabling the development of
general-purpose intelligent machines.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving hardware efficiency for Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) workloads by introducing a hybrid traversal method for binary tree patterns and evaluating a specialized hardware accelerator, the Multifunction Tree Unit (MTU).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of computationally intensive ZKP kernels, such as SumCheck protocol and Merkle Tree commitments, by optimizing binary tree traversal strategies for both multi-threaded CPUs and hardware accelerators.

Method: A systematic evaluation of binary tree workloads under different traversal strategies was conducted. They introduced a Hybrid Traversal method, aiming to reduce memory traffic and improve parallelism on hardware accelerators like MTU.

Result: The hardware accelerator (MTU) showed up to 1478x speedup over CPUs at DDR-level bandwidth, and their proposed Hybrid Traversal method outperformed standalone approaches by up to 3x.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential for improved efficiency in hardware accelerators tailored for ZKP workloads by exploiting binary tree computational patterns and introducing innovative traversal strategies.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are critical for privacy preservation and
verifiable computation. Many ZKPs rely on kernels such as the SumCheck protocol
and Merkle Tree commitments, which enable their security properties. These
kernels exhibit balanced binary tree computational patterns, which enable
efficient hardware acceleration. Prior work has investigated accelerating these
kernels as part of an overarching ZKP protocol; however, a focused study of how
to best exploit the underlying tree pattern for hardware efficiency remains
limited. We conduct a systematic evaluation of these tree-based workloads under
different traversal strategies, analyzing performance on multi-threaded CPUs
and a hardware accelerator, the Multifunction Tree Unit (MTU). We introduce a
hardware-friendly Hybrid Traversal for binary tree that improves parallelism
and scalability while significantly reducing memory traffic on hardware. Our
results show that MTU achieves up to 1478$\times$ speedup over CPU at DDR-level
bandwidth and that our hybrid traversal outperforms as standalone approach by
up to 3$\times$. These findings offer practical guidance for designing
efficient hardware accelerators for ZKP workloads with binary tree structures.

TL;DR: The DEREK module is a scalable and secure document question-answering system optimized for enterprise use, emphasizing traceable and accurate information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for secure, auditable, and accurate document question-answering systems in high-stakes domains like legal and finance.

Method: The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, incorporating content chunking, hybrid indexing (HNSW+BM25), GPT-4o query refinement, vector and BM25 search, Cohere re-ranking, prompt engineering, and verification through a LangGraph verifier.

Result: The system improved Recall@50 by ~1 pp, Precision@10 by ~7 pp, and reduced unsupported statements to less than 3%, delivering traceable and production-grade performance.

Conclusion: DEREK meets enterprise requirements for secure and reliable document question-answering, with minimal operational overhead, providing a robust solution for critical domains.

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge)
Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed
specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and
implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,
web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a
hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via
combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using
CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,
regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,
1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank
boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe
Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All
components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These
results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and
production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is
designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful
retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal

*Guowen Yuan,Tien-Hsuan Wu,Lianghao Xia,Ben Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses low-resource named entity recognition (NER) by enhancing demonstration learning through improved example selection and adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to improve NER performance in low-resource scenarios by resolving limitations in demonstration example selection and inadequate reference ability in NER taggers.

Method: They developed a dual similarity-based example selection (semantic and feature similarity) and an adversarial demonstration training approach.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance gains using their methods in low-resource NER tasks compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that dual similarity and adversarial demonstration training are effective in improving NER tasks in limited data scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration
learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration
construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting
demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that
feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly,
we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is
generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that
effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select
examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and
feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with
adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the
demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive
experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our
method outperforms a range of methods.

### [51] [Small Edits, Big Consequences: Telling Good from Bad Robustness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15868)
*Altynbek Ismailov,Salia Asanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness and sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to prompt perturbations during code generation tasks, revealing strengths in ignoring underspecification but weaknesses in detecting crucial semantic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to understand the boundaries of LLM robustness by investigating when their robustness becomes problematic, especially in scenarios where even minor errors could lead to significant safety or financial consequences.

Method: The study uses 50 LeetCode problems and introduces three types of minimal prompt perturbations: underspecification (deleting 10% of words progressively), lexical flip (changing a pivotal word like 'max' to 'min'), and jargon inflation (replacing simple words with obscure synonyms). Six LLMs, including reasoning-tuned variants, are evaluated based on whether they adapt to these perturbations or reuse the baseline solution.

Result: The models maintained 85% correctness even with 90% of the prompt missing, but only 54% reacted to a single quantifier flip, with reasoning-tuned models performing worse. Jargon edits yielded a 56% pass rate. This indicates a sharp asymmetry in their sensitivity to different types of prompt perturbations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to differentiate between harmless noise and meaning-changing edits, often treating both as ignorable. The authors recommend training and evaluation protocols that encourage differential sensitivity to handle such situations appropriately.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a
single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to
overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful
insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal
prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive
underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping
a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a
common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including
three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python
outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they
reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a
sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 %
of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet
only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with
reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie
in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between
harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.
Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We
advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential
sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when
semantics truly change.

*Sumit Singh,Rohit Mishra,Uma Shanker Tiwary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing Hindi NER using pretrained encoders, generative models, and retrieval augmentation (RA), yielding significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of enhancing Named Entity Recognition (NER), specifically for the Hindi language, given its limited linguistic resources.

Method: Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL, XLM-R) and generative models (e.g., GPT3.5-turbo, Llama variants) are used along with data retrieval augmentation from external sources like Wikipedia.

Result: RA improved the macro F1 scores of MuRIL and XLM-R from 0.69/0.495 to 0.70/0.71 respectively. Fine-tuned models and augmented generative models showed superior performance.

Conclusion: Retrieval Augmentation significantly enhances NER in low-resource languages, indicating its utility for data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity
recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual
input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique
that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and
Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf
(Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments
the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from
Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA.
However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER
generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)
with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't
incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69
and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,
respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B
by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not
fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA
well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval
context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,
especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about
how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER
performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

*Benoit Dherin,Michael Munn,Hanna Mazzawi,Michael Wunder,Javier Gonzalvo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn new patterns during inference without weight updates, attributing this ability to the interaction between self-attention and MLP layers in transformer blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms that allow LLMs to learn new patterns during inference, particularly their in-context learning capabilities, which are not well understood.

Method: The researchers combine theoretical analysis and experimentation to examine how a transformer block's self-attention layer and MLP layer interact to modify the MLP weights implicitly based on contextual input.

Result: They demonstrate under simplifying assumptions that transformer blocks can convert contextual information into a low-rank weight update for the MLP layer.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational explanation for how in-context learning might occur in LLMs and advances our theoretical understanding of transformer architecture.

Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their
ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn
new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are
presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were
not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are
still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a
self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly
modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through
theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why
LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show
under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly
transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) can support creative writers by offering meaningful feedback. It introduces a new task, dataset, and evaluation frameworks, utilizing corrupted stories to study model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding whether LLMs can effectively provide valuable feedback for creative writing and identify their limitations.

Method: The authors create a dataset of 1,300 intentionally corrupted stories and evaluate the performance of LLMs through both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

Result: LLMs perform well in giving specific and mostly accurate feedback but struggle to pinpoint major writing issues and balance critical versus positive feedback.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promising potential for writing feedback, they require improvements in identifying critical issues and balancing feedback types to better support creative writers.

Abstract: Can LLMs provide support to creative writers by giving meaningful writing
feedback? In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of
model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and
evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we
present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally
introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in
this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows
that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects --
providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often
fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide
when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mRAKL, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction reformulated as a Question Answering task, focusing on low-resource languages Tigrinya and Amharic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the construction of multilingual knowledge graphs (mKGC), especially for low-resourced languages, by utilizing cross-lingual transfer and reformulating the task as question answering.

Method: The method involves using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system where a BM25 retriever retrieves context to assist in predicting missing knowledge elements in mKGC.

Result: The study shows performance improvements in mKGC by 4.92% and 8.79% for Tigrinya and Amharic languages, respectively, when using an ideal retrieval system.

Conclusion: The mRAKL system is effective for multilingual knowledge graph tasks, showing potential for low-resource languages with the aid of idealized retrieval and cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs represent real-world entities and the relationships between
them. Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of
automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for
knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the
mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve
this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having
our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily
on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using
higher-resourced languages Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer. With
a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over
a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized
retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points
for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

*Simon Baeuerle,Max Radyschevski,Ulrike Pado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates using generative AI (genAI) models to optimize meeting documentation and information retrieval in engineering settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in knowledge sharing during meetings, such as inconsistent documentation and difficulty in retrieving shared information.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline was built, integrating genAI for meeting transcription, creating searchable minutes, and testing it in a real-world engineering department.

Result: Survey data from users revealed reduced meeting effort, solved technical challenges, but highlighted ethical and organizational concerns.

Conclusion: Generative AI can streamline meeting workflows but requires careful handling of ethical and organizational dimensions for real-world applicability.

Abstract: In large organisations, knowledge is mainly shared in meetings, which takes
up significant amounts of work time. Additionally, frequent in-person meetings
produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes,
presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard
to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and
high-frequency meeting schedules.
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language
processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management
in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and
integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable
format for ad-hoc searches.
  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting
documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and
minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through
a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software
tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey
data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this
real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that
the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI
models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational
aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.

Motivation: Existing LLM-powered research agents struggle with generating complex and coherent long-form research reports using generic algorithms. The authors aim to address this limitation by mimicking the iterative, human-like process of research.

Method: The authors propose TTD-DR, which conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. The approach starts with a draft skeleton, iteratively refines it via a denoising process, integrates external information dynamically for updates, and employs a self-evolutionary algorithm.

Result: TTD-DR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks requiring intensive search and multi-hop reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The TTD-DR framework improves coherence, reduces information loss, and enhances the efficiency of the research report generation process by iteratively refining drafts.

Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly
advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,
long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing
inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles
of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep
Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report
generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a
preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation
to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through
a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism
that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is
further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of
the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the
diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process
more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative
search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and
multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

### [58] [The Prompt Makes the Person(a): A Systematic Evaluation of Sociodemographic Persona Prompting for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16076)
*Marlene Lutz,Indira Sen,Georg Ahnert,Elisa Rogers,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how different persona prompt strategies affect the ability of large language models (LLMs) to simulate sociodemographic groups accurately. Smaller models sometimes outperform larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address concerns about the fidelity of sociodemographic simulations in LLMs, especially for marginalized groups, and explore ways to improve them.

Method: The study systematically tests five open-source LLMs on 15 demographic groups using open- and closed-ended tasks, evaluating prompt strategies like role adoption formats and demographic priming.

Result: LLMs struggle with marginalized groups, but strategies like interview-style prompting and name-based priming reduce stereotyping. Smaller models like OLMo-2-7B surprisingly outperform larger ones in some cases.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidance to improve sociodemographic persona prompts, emphasizing the importance of prompt design in reducing bias and enhancing simulation quality.

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to
simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona
prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about
the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we
systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically
role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM
simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and
closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate
marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern
identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption
strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that
prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce
stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B
outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable
guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation
studies.

*Ondrej Bohdal,Mete Ozay,Jijoong Moon,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Hyeonmok Ko,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform compositional multi-tasking efficiently, especially in on-device settings with limited computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of LLMs has highlighted the need for handling multi-task scenarios concurrently, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Current methods lack efficiency and applicability for compositional tasks, prompting the need for advancement.

Method: The authors propose 'Learnable Calibration,' a method aimed at efficiently enabling LLMs to perform compositional multi-tasking in on-device applications. Additionally, they introduce a benchmark of four compositional tasks for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated effectiveness in handling compositional tasks while maintaining high performance and computational efficiency, suitable for constrained environments.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for improving LLMs' multi-tasking capabilities in resource-limited scenarios, opening up possibilities for their practical application in complex real-world use cases.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine
learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large
language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to
support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work
on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been
limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In
this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based
compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous
execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a
long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks
concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark
comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an
efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,
where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions
that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the
groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking
scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use
cases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIDWESH, a multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset to improve detection capabilities across regional Bangladeshi dialects, addressing prevailing gaps in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hate speech detection systems for Bangla lack coverage of informal and culturally diverse regional dialects, limiting their effectiveness and leading to biased moderation.

Method: The authors constructed the BIDWESH dataset by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major Bangla dialects, ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy through manual verification and labeling.

Result: The BIDWESH dataset offers a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive resource, categorized by hate speech type and target group, for use in Bangla NLP tools.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of dialect-sensitive approaches for equitable and context-aware moderation in low-resource languages, forming a basis for future tools and methodologies.

Abstract: Hate speech on digital platforms has become a growing concern globally,
especially in linguistically diverse countries like Bangladesh, where regional
dialects play a major role in everyday communication. Despite progress in hate
speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to
address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as
Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection
capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content
unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first
multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and
annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional
dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type
(slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual,
male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The
resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive
resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the
groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes
significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource
language settings.

### [61] [Do Large Language Models Have a Planning Theory of Mind? Evidence from MindGames: a Multi-Step Persuasion Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16196)
*Jared Moore,Ned Cooper,Rasmus Overmark,Beba Cibralic,Nick Haber,Cameron R. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'MindGames,' a planning-based Theory of Mind (PToM) task. It investigates how humans and LLMs infer beliefs and desires to influence others' behavior, showing a performance gap in social reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs demonstrate some Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities, traditional ToM experiments emphasize observation rather than dynamic planning and influencing others. This paper aims to explore LLMs' capabilities in these practical use cases of ToM.

Method: The researchers developed 'MindGames,' a task that requires agents to infer others' mental states to alter their actions and compared human performance with an LLM (o1-preview) for planning and social reasoning tasks.

Result: Humans outperformed o1-preview by 11% (p=0.006) in the PToM task requiring inference of mental states, while the model outperformed humans in tasks requiring planning but minimal social reasoning.

Conclusion: There exists a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and the abilities of LLMs, highlighting areas requiring improvement in models' capacities for causal understanding of others' mental states.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind
(ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial
role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human
ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically
intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning
theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's
beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous
evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans
significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;
$p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model
of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's
preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline
condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state
inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already
given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between
human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

*Zipeng Ling,Yuehao Tang,Shuliang Liu,Junqi Yang,Shenghong Fu,Yao Wan,Kejia Huang,Zhichao Hou,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) respond with "Unknown" and introduces a framework to understand the reasons behind such responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and distinguish why LLMs respond with "Unknown," separating true uncertainty from model incapacity and improving reasoning evaluation.

Method: The authors develop a framework to quantify and analyze the causes of "Unknown" responses in LLMs, proposing guided stimulation to turn such responses into conclusive answers.

Result: The framework identifies how much of the "Unknown" responses arise from model incapacity versus intrinsic indeterminacy, offering insights into the reasoning performance of LLMs.

Conclusion: This study provides a new perspective on understanding and addressing the "Vague Perception" phenomenon in LLMs and their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, yet
current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are
\emph{honest} rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an
input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the
model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon \emph{Vague Perception}. And
thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of \emph{Unknown}
responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation
can convert them into either correct (\emph{Known}) or intrinsically
indeterminate outcomes. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method
provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for
improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different
LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the
accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the
true reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the
\emph{Vague Perception} phenomenon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two strategies to improve demonstration selection in long-context large language models for in-context learning, achieving better performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inefficiencies and high inference costs of random demonstration selection often used in many-shot in-context learning while maintaining comparable or superior performance.

Method: Two demonstration selection strategies are proposed: (1) A hybrid approach combining a few similarity-based demonstrations with a larger set of cached random demonstrations, and (2) a refinement where random demonstrations are replaced by centroid-based clustering via k-means.

Result: The proposed methods outperform random selection and often surpass other selection strategies, while reducing inference cost significantly and supporting caching.

Conclusion: Adjusting the proportion of demonstrations offers a balance between performance and inference costs, making the methods practical and efficient for many-shot in-context learning.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs
containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning
(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the
input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of
demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)
high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and
(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when
scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for
demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal
computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of
demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a
disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The
second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with
those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via
k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several
datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection
and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting
caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on
different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Motivation: Currently, AI agents for professional and complex tasks, such as financial research, lack systematic evaluation frameworks and benchmarks.

Method: FinResearchBench employs a logic tree-based Agent-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate financial research agents on 7 key types of financial research tasks.

Result: The framework covers 70 diverse financial research questions and systematically assesses agents' capabilities across different task domains.

Conclusion: FinResearchBench provides a reliable and comprehensive evaluation system, filling the gap in assessing deep financial research agents.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in
professional research applications, such as STEM, software development,
finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as
it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity.
However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically
and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents.
Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety.
To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based
Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It
provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across
7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of
this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system
that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the
intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust
evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research
questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the
domain.

*Hyunji Nam,Omer Gottesman,Amy Zhang,Dean Foster,Emma Brunskill,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for improving LLM-based math tutors by focusing on latent state representations and long-term objectives, rather than immediate human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems, using RLHF, optimize for immediate responses but are insufficient for tasks requiring multi-turn dialogues, such as math tutoring.

Method: The proposed method uses a latent state representation to model dialogue history and employs a long-term policy to guide the tutor's high-level actions.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves better long-term outcomes in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks compared to direct utterance-generation methods.

Conclusion: This refined model enhances LLM-based tutoring efficiency by focusing on latent states and long-term learning goals with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on
immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in
multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method
to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a
lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a
long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The
goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of
guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our
model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of
training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next
utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to
improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring
tasks.

Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of erasing sensitive, non-compliant data from LLMs that have memorized such information during pre-training, under computational resource constraints.

Method: The paper introduces 'Effective Unlearning Loss,' a more controllable way to forget sensitive information from LLMs. Various techniques were integrated and tested for optimized unlearning.

Result: The proposed system achieved competitive results, ranking 5th on the leaderboard in SemEval 2025 Task 4.

Conclusion: Efficient and controlled methods for unlearning sensitive information from LLMs are possible, with Effective Unlearning Loss providing a promising solution.

Abstract: As the Large Language Model (LLM) gains widespread adoption, increasing
attention has been given to the challenge of making LLM forget non-compliant
data memorized during its pre-training. Machine Unlearning focuses on
efficiently erasing sensitive information from LLM under limited computational
resources. To advance research in this area, SemEval 2025 Task 4: "Unlearning
Sensitive Content from Large Language Models" introduces three unlearning
datasets and establishes a benchmark by evaluating both forgetting
effectiveness and the preservation of standard capabilities. In this work, we
propose a more controllable forgetting loss, Effective Unlearning Loss, and
explore its integration with various techniques to achieve more efficient and
controlled unlearning. Our system ultimately ranked 5th on the competition

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies of LLMs in producing organized, traceable, and contextually structured outputs when handling fragmented complex documents.

Method: The authors developed a bilingual benchmark (AOE) with 11 tasks across three diverse domains, designed for models to generate context-specific schemas. They evaluated open and closed LLMs' abilities to handle these tasks.

Result: Experiments revealed that even the most advanced LLMs failed to perform adequately in comprehending and organizing fragmented document information as required by AOE.

Conclusion: Current state-of-the-art LLMs are not yet capable of effectively handling the text-to-table transformations needed for fragmented documents, indicating a significant research gap in organized information extraction.

Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation
that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world
documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style
answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new
bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to
systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents
and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike
conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task
domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains,
requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input
queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source
state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models
struggled significantly. The benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI-powered language models overshadowing classical methods, this paper aims to revisit and validate frequency-based approaches for effective language identification.

Method: The study uses frequency rankings of monograms and bigrams, applied to texts of varying lengths, periods, and genres, to assess language determinism.

Result: The algorithm achieves over 80% accuracy for texts under 150 characters and 100% accuracy for longer older texts.

Conclusion: Frequency-based linguistic approaches remain viable and scalable alternatives to AI-driven methods for language detection tasks.

Abstract: The debate surrounding language identification has gained renewed attention
in recent years, especially with the rapid evolution of AI-powered language
models. However, the non-AI-based approaches to language identification have
been overshadowed. This research explores a mathematical implementation of an
algorithm for language determinism by leveraging monograms and bigrams
frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The datasets
used comprise texts varying in length, historical period, and genre, including
short stories, fairy tales, and poems. Despite these variations, the method
achieves over 80\% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches
100\% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. These results demonstrate
that classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable
alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection.

TL;DR: SpeLLM decouples input and output vocabularies in large language models (LLMs), achieving performance similar to traditional LLMs while reducing computational costs and expanding output space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale LLM vocabulary effectively, alleviate attention's quadratic cost, and address the bottleneck caused by the linear scaling of the output projection layer with vocabulary size.

Method: SpeLLM employs multiple output heads to predict character-level strings, enabling independent smaller linear heads. It also uses a self-distillation strategy to convert standard LLMs into SpeLLM variants.

Result: SpeLLM variants of pre-trained LLMs showed competitive performance on downstream tasks and reduced runtime by an average of 5.1% across models.

Conclusion: SpeLLM offers a method to reduce runtime costs, expand vocabulary scalability, and enhance language coverage in large language models.

Abstract: Scaling LLM vocabulary is often used to reduce input sequence length and
alleviate attention's quadratic cost. Yet, current LLM architectures impose a
critical bottleneck to this procedure: the output projection layer scales
linearly with vocabulary size, rendering substantial expansion impractical. We
propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by
predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM,
each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously,
enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller,
independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for
converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained
LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream
tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach
provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support
for underrepresented languages and domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliable verification in informal language reasoning. This paper explores using formal languages like Dafny for scalable and provable software verification, introducing DafnyComp, a benchmark for verification reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of informal language-based LLMs in generating verifiable programs and proposes grounding models in formal languages to ensure reliable and scalable verification.

Method: The approach uses Dafny as a formal reasoning environment, supported by an automatic data curation pipeline and RL designs integrated with feedback from Dafny's formal language verifier. It includes supervised fine-tuning and RL with regularization.

Result: Fine-tuning enables small models to generate verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary alternatives. RL with regularization further boosts performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in out-of-domain tasks on the DafnyComp benchmark.

Conclusion: Grounding LLMs in formal languages with scalable RL training methods can enable reliable reasoning and software verification, potentially surpassing proprietary models.

Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models
(LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge:
their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are
neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models
could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted
alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous
formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,
Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their
reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving
large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to
employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the
reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes
unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex
programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human
priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot
study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data
curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the
formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional
formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification
reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models
(e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code,
surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves
performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and
outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates gender bias in German Large Language Models (LLMs) using a translated and manually reviewed benchmark dataset for Question Answering, revealing systematic biases in the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and assess the presence of gender bias in German LLMs and improve fairness in NLP.

Method: The English gender bias benchmark dataset for Question Answering was machine translated to German, manually corrected to address grammatical gender complexities, and split into two subsets for evaluation—group terms and proper names.

Result: All evaluated German LLMs showed biases, including alignment with and deviations from traditional social stereotypes.

Conclusion: Manual review is critical for bias evaluation datasets, and German LLMs require improvements to address their inherent gender biases.

Abstract: Within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), fairness evaluation
is often associated with the assessment of bias and reduction of associated
harm. In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a
benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the
measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions,
including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large
Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by
Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender
identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German.
The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and
corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of
the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation
because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language
such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two
subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity,
and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate
several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the
accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both
along and against existing social stereotypes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PromptAL, a hybrid active learning framework designed to optimize few-shot learning by utilizing unlabeled data to align the empirical distribution with the target distribution, improving sample selection and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active learning approaches fail to address the misalignment between empirical and target distributions in few-shot scenarios, leading to suboptimal model decision boundaries and inadequate sample selection.

Method: PromptAL leverages unlabeled data to construct dynamic soft prompts that adjust the predictive distribution and decision boundary of the model, and combines uncertainty and diversity estimation for effective sample selection.

Result: PromptAL demonstrated superior performance compared to nine baseline methods across six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PromptAL effectively improves the alignment of empirical and target distributions in few-shot active learning, enhancing model training and sample selection.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL
methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the
decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently
identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the
empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target
distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal
position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in
enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target
distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of
samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,
we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware
Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning).
This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in
aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,
thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first
leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that
adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,
based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation
with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more
accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six
in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior
performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

### [73] [Dutch CrowS-Pairs: Adapting a Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Language Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16442)
*Elza Strazda,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a Dutch adaptation of the CrowS-Pairs dataset to measure bias in Dutch language models, finds bias in multiple categories, compares bias across languages, and highlights cultural and linguistic factors' role in shaping biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fair and safe language models and expand bias measurement beyond English to other languages like Dutch.

Method: Develop a Dutch version of the CrowS-Pairs dataset with 1463 sentence pairs, test bias across nine categories, and evaluate bias in Dutch, English, and French language models.

Result: Dutch models exhibit substantial bias but lower compared to English models. Assigning a persona to models changes bias levels. French models show less bias than English ones.

Conclusion: Bias levels in language models vary significantly across languages, categories, personas, and are influenced by cultural and linguistic factors.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes
which might be upsetting.
  Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and
harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of
these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of
recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language
models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A
Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in
Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463
sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation,
Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting
sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the
other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that
various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and
Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using
the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated
in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language
models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas
Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that
assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.
These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,
suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in
shaping model biases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduced a framework to ensure LLM agents adhere to complex business policies across workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of LLM agents to reliably follow intricate company policies in automated processes.

Method: Proposed a two-phase framework: a buildtime phase to compile policies into guard codes and a runtime phase to ensure compliance during agent action.

Result: Implemented the framework in the challenging τ-bench Airlines domain with promising preliminary results in policy enforcement.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of deterministic and modular systems for enforcing policy adherence, paving the way for real-world applications despite existing challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents hold promise for a flexible and scalable
alternative to traditional business process automation, but struggle to
reliably follow complex company policies. In this study we introduce a
deterministic, transparent, and modular framework for enforcing business policy
adherence in agentic workflows. Our method operates in two phases: (1) an
offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard
code associated with tool use, and (2) a runtime integration where these guards
ensure compliance before each agent action. We demonstrate our approach on the
challenging $\tau$-bench Airlines domain, showing encouraging preliminary
results in policy enforcement, and further outline key challenges for
real-world deployments.

*Zhenliang Zhang,Xinyu Hu,Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ICR Score and ICR Probe to better detect hallucinations in large language models by analyzing the dynamic evolution of hidden states and achieves more effective results with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate hallucinations, undermining their reliability, and existing methods inadequately address the dynamic evolution of hidden states across layers.

Method: The authors propose the ICR Score to quantify module contributions to hidden state updates and the ICR Probe method to capture cross-layer hidden state evolution for hallucination detection.

Result: Experiments show that the ICR Probe outperforms existing methods in hallucination detection and uses fewer parameters; ablation studies improve understanding of the mechanics.

Conclusion: The ICR Probe offers a reliable, interpretable, and efficient method for hallucination detection in LLMs by leveraging dynamic hidden state behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

### [76] [Combining Language and Topic Models for Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16490)
*Jaco du Toit,Marcel Dunaiski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates hierarchical text classification (HTC) by combining pre-trained language models (PLMs) and topic models, finding that topic model features generally reduce classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether combining finer-grained contextual features from PLMs with high-level corpus-wide representations from topic models improves HTC performance.

Method: The approach extracts features from both PLMs and topic models, processes them through separate convolutional layers, combines outputs via label-wise attention, and evaluates on benchmark HTC datasets.

Result: Combination of topic model features with PLM features was generally detrimental to HTC performance, contradicting previous assumptions.

Conclusion: Topic model features should not be assumed to enhance text classification tasks when combined with PLM features.

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task
which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes
from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various
techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the
natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models
along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an
effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale
behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM
captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic
model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents
as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic
model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a
classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of
the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in
general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate
convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise
attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by
weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform
comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using
the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification
performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In
contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features
extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed
beneficial.

TL;DR: The Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE) is a dynamic benchmark for assessing foundation models' scientific understanding with a focus on validity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in evaluating foundation models due to data leakage risks and inefficiency in large-scale testing.

Method: EESE uses a non-public pool of 100K science instances built via a multi-stage pipeline, coupled with a periodically updated subset for reliable evaluations.

Result: Experiments reveal EESE's ability to identify strengths and weaknesses of foundation models across scientific domains and cognitive dimensions.

Conclusion: EESE serves as a robust and scalable benchmark, facilitating realistic evaluations of foundation models' capabilities in science questions.

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating
their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science
benchmarks have made progress towards broad **Range**, wide **Reach**, and high
**Rigor**, yet they often face two major challenges: **data leakage risks**
that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to
large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving
Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess
scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two
components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed
science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+
subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**,
and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled
and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.
Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE
effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific
fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and
forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic
measure of how well foundation models handle science questions. The project

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether sentence-level Quality Estimation (QE) improves post-editing in English-Chinese Machine Translation workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how QE impacts post-editing efficiency and student translators' perceptions, particularly across varying translation qualities and expertise levels.

Method: Investigates interaction effects of QE with machine translation quality and translator expertise through examining post-editing speed and qualitative perceptions.

Result: QE significantly reduces post-editing time, and its effectiveness is consistent across medium- to high-quality MT outputs and translators' diverse expertise levels.

Conclusion: While QE enhances efficiency in MTPE, inaccurate QE may hinder the process. Optimizing QE usage can improve translator productivity.

Abstract: This preliminary study investigates the usefulness of sentence-level Quality
Estimation (QE) in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE),
focusing on its impact on post-editing speed and student translators'
perceptions. It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT
quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal
that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction
effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE
efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student
translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating
potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as
validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to
double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that
inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new
insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more
effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges in manipulating and analyzing text styles, such as preserving content in text style alteration or creating explainable authorship verification.

Method: Utilizes parameter-efficient LLM adaptations, contrastive feature disentanglement, and instruction-based fine-tuning methodologies.

Result: Enhanced approaches to text style transfer, authorship attribution, and verification, leveraging advanced AI frameworks.

Conclusion: The thesis provides innovative solutions for understanding and modifying text styles, improving computational text analysis techniques.

Abstract: This thesis advances the computational understanding and manipulation of text
styles through three interconnected pillars: (1) Text Style Transfer (TST),
which alters stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment, formality) while preserving
content; (2)Authorship Attribution (AA), identifying the author of a text via
stylistic fingerprints; and (3) Authorship Verification (AV), determining
whether two texts share the same authorship. We address critical challenges in
these areas by leveraging parameter-efficient adaptation of large language
models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and
instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to extend gender bias evaluation methods, initially devised for English, to other languages, focusing on German.

Method: The authors developed five German datasets rooted in established gender bias concepts and used diverse methodologies to evaluate eight multilingual LLMs.

Result: Their findings indicate specific challenges such as the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms and the impact of neutral nouns on gender perception in the German language.

Conclusion: This paper emphasizes the importance of customized evaluation frameworks to better understand and address gender bias in LLMs across different languages.

Abstract: In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias
in large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of
bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when
applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research
strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs.
The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are
accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight
multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias
in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms
and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work
contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and
underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multimodal language models (MLLMs) on physics tasks, revealing challenges with vision-language integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and understand the limitations of MLLMs in solving intuitive physics tasks involving multimodal integration.

Method: Evaluated open-source and proprietary MLLMs on physics tasks, analyzed embeddings for visual-linguistic alignment issues.

Result: Vision encoders capture physical plausibility, but language models fail to utilize this information effectively, revealing misalignment.

Conclusion: Improving vision-language alignment is critical for advancing MLLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and
IntPhys 2 datasets. We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that
even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible
from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a
probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations
at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is
preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical
vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture
physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by
the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment
suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not
the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic
information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for
improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for their performance in detecting regulatory compliance in financial document auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI systems' ability to verify compliance of financial report excerpts with legal mandates.

Method: Comparison of the performance of open-source (e.g., Llama-2) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT) using two custom datasets from PwC Germany.

Result: Llama-2 excels in detecting non-compliance, while GPT-4 performs better in diverse and non-English scenarios.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs show promise but proprietary models like GPT-4 are more versatile overall.

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,
stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made
inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages
from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting
standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall
short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific
legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly
available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance
across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on
comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their
proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis
leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model
demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true
negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless,
proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of
scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine the phonological capabilities of text-based large language models and improve their performance in tasks like rhyme generation and syllable counting.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs with the PhonologyBench suite; introduced Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt informed by educational theories.

Result: P-CoT prompts improved performance up to 52%, sometimes surpassing human baselines in phonological tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding educational theory-based structured guidance can activate latent phonological abilities in LLMs, opening paths for optimization in future linguistic applications.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of phonological reasoning within text-based
large language models (LLMs). Utilizing the PhonologyBench benchmark, we assess
tasks like rhyme word generation, g2p conversion, and syllable counting. Our
evaluations across 12 LLMs reveal that while few-shot learning offers
inconsistent gains, the introduction of a novel Pedagogically-motivated
Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt, which is anchored in educational
theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, consistently enhances
performance. This method leverages structured guidance to activate latent
phonological abilities, achieving up to 52% improvement and even surpassing
human baselines in certain tasks. Future work could aim to optimize P-CoT
prompts for specific models or explore their application across different
linguistic domains.

*Yujin Han,Hao Chen,Andi Han,Zhiheng Wang,Xinyu Lin,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights self-contradictions in multimodal models, introduces a "Nonunified" score to measure them, and proposes strategies to align generation with understanding for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to unify generation and understanding tasks, often producing contradictory results.

Method: Quantifying self-contradictions through the Nonunified score, leveraging self-supervision, applying post-training methods, analyzing dynamics, and introducing a curriculum-based strategy for training.

Result: Improved generation and understanding performance, revealing co-improvement and co-degradation mechanics, and validating findings through empirical results.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies enhance the unification of generation and understanding tasks in MLLMs but highlight the importance of data quality checks.

Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a
single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation
produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own
understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such
self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction
mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather
than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of
leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model
understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the
generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,
SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation
and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and
understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known
in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows
improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously
incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned
training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced
prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the
understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of
co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is
empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics
like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,
which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a
curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces
harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and
improved MLLM generation and understanding.

*Han Jiang,Dongyao Zhu,Zhihua Wei,Xiaoyuan Yi,Ziang Xiao,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PICACO introduces a method to optimize LLMs' ability to align with multiple human values simultaneously without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to align with diverse human values due to the Instruction Bottleneck, which restricts handling conflicting value demands.

Method: PICACO utilizes a meta-instruction optimization process that maximizes total correlation between values and responses, enhancing value alignment without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: PICACO demonstrated superior performance in aligning LLMs with up to 8 distinct human values in experiments involving both black-box and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed PICACO method effectively addresses value pluralism challenges within ICA by balancing diverse preferences and outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate
diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment
(ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting
ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently
pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.
tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck
challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a
single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we
propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO
optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit
LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by
maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,
theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,
resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value
sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,
outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance
across up to 8 distinct values.

### [89] [RAVine: Reality-Aligned Evaluation for Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16725)
*Yilong Xu,Xiang Long,Zhi Zheng,Jinhua Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAVine, a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored for agentic search systems, addressing the misalignment issues of existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address deficiencies in current evaluation frameworks for agentic search, such as unrealistic benchmarks, noise in ground truth extraction, and lack of focus on iterative search processes.

Method: The proposed method, RAVine, involves realistic multi-point queries, long-form answers, an attributable ground truth construction strategy, and evaluation of iterative processes and efficiency.

Result: The framework successfully benchmarks various models and provides insights into improving agentic search systems.

Conclusion: RAVine fills critical gaps in the evaluation of agentic search systems, contributing to both their development and more accurate assessment.

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval
augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However,
existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic
search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often
deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to
introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,
leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current
frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the
evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address
these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework
for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form
answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground
truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.
Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the
iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a
series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will
contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

### [90] [Unpacking Ambiguity: The Interaction of Polysemous Discourse Markers and Non-DM Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16748)
*Jingni Wu,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Discourse markers like 'but'/'then' crucially influence coherence. This study explores the co-occurrence of ambiguous markers with non-DM signals and how genre factors in.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse markers are often ambiguous and interact with non-discourse markers. Understanding their mechanism and genre influence is vital.

Method: Researchers use the eRST framework, a graded DM polysemy definition, and statistical analyses (correlation, regression) to investigate marker-signal relations.

Result: Polysemous DMs co-occur with diverse, yet not necessarily more numerous, non-DMs. Genre significantly impacts these interactions.

Conclusion: DM interactions are shaped by polysemy and genre influence, underscoring diversity but not frequency of related signals.

Abstract: Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating
coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs
('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous
('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such
signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM
signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.
  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy,
and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous
DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings
reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the
total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover,
genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

*Hongyin Luo,Nathaniel Morgan,Tina Li,Derek Zhao,Ai Vy Ngo,Philip Schroeder,Lijie Yang,Assaf Ben-Kish,Jack O'Brien,James Glass*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thread Inference Model (TIM) and TIMRUN runtime for overcoming large language model (LLM) context limitations, enabling unlimited memory and long-horizon reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and accuracy limits caused by context length restrictions in LLMs during complex reasoning tasks.

Method: TIM represents reasoning problems as trees of thoughts, tasks, and conclusions, using recursive, decompositional approaches and rule-based pruning for memory efficiency.

Result: The system enhances inference throughput and accuracy on mathematical reasoning and information retrieval tasks, while managing up to 90% of positional embeddings in GPU memory.

Conclusion: TIM and TIMRUN successfully overcome LLM bottlenecks, offering scalable reasoning capabilities and structured handling of extended contexts and multi-hop tool interactions.

Abstract: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck
reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),
a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and
TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond
context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited
working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model
inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and
GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as
reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.
The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and
conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During
generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states
of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning
mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages
throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high
inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU
memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles
information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and
multi-hop tool use.

### [92] [Test-Time-Matching: Decouple Personality, Memory, and Linguistic Style in LLM-based Role-Playing Language Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16799)
*Xiaoyu Zhan,Xinyu Fu,Hao Sun,Yuanqi Li,Jie Guo,Yanwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free Test-Time-Matching (TTM) framework for improving role-playing performance in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decoupling character features and applying a structured pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies of prompts/context inputs and the limitations of fine-tuning approaches in enabling LLMs to deeply immerse in role-playing tasks, especially for well-known figures.

Method: The authors propose TTM, a framework that decouples character features into personality, memory, and linguistic style, applied through a three-stage generation pipeline for structured and controlled role-playing.

Result: TTM showcases high-fidelity role-playing, enabling consistent character dialogues across various stylistic and personality/memory combinations, verified through human assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed TTM framework significantly improves role-playing in LLMs without requiring training, making it resource-efficient and highly versatile for linguistic and character variations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled
role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various
applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often
proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,
particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,
fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated
with data collection and the computational resources required for training,
thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we
propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework
through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to
automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and
linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation
pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves
high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations
across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.
We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate
that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive
and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

Conclusion: Agentar-Fin-R1 is a highly effective, trustworthy, and specialized solution for financial applications, setting a new benchmark for performance and reliability in the domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate tremendous potential in the
financial domain, yet existing models often fall short in scenarios demanding
robust reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness requirements, and
efficient adaptation to task-specific needs. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1
series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically
engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning
capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial
applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic
financial task taxonomy with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness
assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy
knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous
data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware
optimization, tow-stage learning processes, and detailed attribution systems,
we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo
comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including FinEva,
FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500
and GPQA. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we
innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on
agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental
results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning
capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for
high-stakes financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately assess linguistic and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in low-resource and diverse cultural contexts.

Method: LingBench++ incorporates structured reasoning, typological metadata, and a multi-agent architecture to improve evaluation of linguistic tasks.

Result: Models utilizing external knowledge and iterative reasoning exhibit better performance in both accuracy and interpretability compared to single-pass models.

Conclusion: LingBench++ sets a foundation to improve linguistic, cultural, and cognitive capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: We propose LingBench++, a linguistically-informed benchmark and reasoning
framework designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex
linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL).
Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++
provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich
typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages.
We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge
retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through
systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we
demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative
reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and
interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing
linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible
reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper presents new datasets and models to advance AI-driven scientific reasoning, filling a gap in open-source scientific reasoning resources with large-scale datasets and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance AI's ability in scientific reasoning and address the lack of large-scale, high-quality open datasets for this domain.

Method: Introduction of the TextbookReasoning and MegaScience datasets along with a comprehensive evaluation system and training of AI models for advanced scientific reasoning.

Result: MegaScience datasets outperform existing alternatives in efficiency and accuracy, and AI models trained on it show superior results compared to their official counterparts.

Conclusion: Open-source datasets, evaluation systems, and trained models made available to improve scientific reasoning research with ongoing scalability advantages.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting
human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery.
However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and
coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of
open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To
bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring
truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific
textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific
disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of
high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed
through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection
methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available
scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system
covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,
incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate
evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve
superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths
compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train
Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which
significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average
performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger
and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We
release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven
trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding emotions in dynamic social settings is challenging due to the interplay between facial expressions and situational cues.

Method: A salience-adjusted framework is developed using Bayesian Cue Integration and Visual-Language Models, evaluated with human annotations and systems in emotionally charged scenarios.

Result: Incorporating salience adjustment improves emotion recognition performance in contexts like prisoner's dilemma.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances emotion recognition and provides a foundation for future research in broader social contexts and applications.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts requires an understanding of
the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. This
paper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion
recognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models
(VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the
expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations
and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios,
which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that
incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to
broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for assessing the performance of Vision Language Models on long, complex, multimodal documents.

Method: A benchmark named Document Haystack was created with 400 document variants (5-200 pages), "needles" (text or text+image) placed at various depths, 8,250 questions, and an evaluation framework.

Result: The study applies the benchmark to various prominent Vision Language Models to analyze performance and reveals insights into their retrieval capabilities.

Conclusion: Document Haystack showcases the challenges of analyzing long multimodal documents, setting a foundation for future advances in this field.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly
advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from
different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains
under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this,
we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is

*Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira,Arathy Jeevan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates the use of generative data augmentation for object re-identification, highlighting performance issues due to domain shifts and lack of feature preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of generative models in improving object re-identification, a task requiring preservation of fine-grained visual details.

Method: The researchers used a novel pipeline termed PAT++, incorporating Diffusion Self-Distillation with Part-Aware Transformer, and experimented using the Urban Elements ReID dataset.

Result: The integration of generative data resulted in consistent performance degradation due to domain shifts and inadequate retention of identity-specific features.

Conclusion: Generative models face significant limitations in preserving identity-defining features for fine-grained recognition tasks, challenging their utility in this domain.

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

*Liuchi Xu,Kang Liu,Jinshuai Liu,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a technique to enhance student learning via fine-grained logit relationship analysis and adaptive weighting strategies. Experiments show superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logit distillation methods lack detailed exploration of fine-grained inter-class relationships, limiting their efficacy in transferring nuanced knowledge.

Method: The proposed LDRLD method recursively decouples and recombines logit information. Additionally, an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy employs Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD) to dynamically adjust weights for category pairs.

Result: LDRLD improves student learning and performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods via experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Fine-grained knowledge transfer, focusing on inter-class relationships and adaptive weighting, significantly enhances the efficacy of logit distillation methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper explores using pre-trained CNN models for Mpox detection, achieving high accuracy (up to 95%) with Grad-CAM enhancing model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective early Mpox diagnosis due to its similarity with other skin conditions, and AI, especially deep learning, has untapped potential in this area.

Method: The study employs pre-trained CNN models (like VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) with transfer learning techniques to fine-tune and adapt them for Mpox detection using binary and multi-class datasets, validated with multiple performance metrics.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved 95% accuracy on binary data, MobileNetV2 achieved 93% accuracy on multi-class data, and Grad-CAM effectively highlighted critical features despite some overfitting issues.

Conclusion: Pre-trained CNNs combined with XAI techniques show promise for Mpox detection but dataset limitations and model interpretability need further attention in future research.

Abstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency

*Ahmed Aman Ibrahim,Hamad Mansour Alawar,Abdulnasser Abbas Zehi,Ahmed Mohammad Alkendi,Bilal Shafi Ashfaq Ahmed Mirza,Shan Ullah,Ismail Lujain Jaleel,Hassan Ugail*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight framework for automatic face quality assessment to improve face verification under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-quality face images, affected by issues such as motion blur, occlusion, or extreme poses, significantly reduce face verification accuracy.

Method: The framework combines normalized facial landmarks with Random Forest Regression for quality assessment, achieving high accuracy (96.67%).

Result: The integration of the quality assessment improves verification performance, achieving a 99.7% reduction in false rejection rates and better cosine similarity scores with ArcFace.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances face verification by mitigating poor image quality impacts, outperforming other techniques while addressing variations in resolution and pose commonly faced in surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents FW-VTON, a virtual try-on method for person-to-person garment transfer, achieving state-of-the-art results using a newly proposed dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods emphasize garment-to-person try-on, requiring flat representations. This study shifts focus to person-to-person try-on, which reconstructs garments from images of individuals.

Method: FW-VTON operates in three stages: extracting flattened garments, warping them to match target poses, and integrating them onto target individuals. A new dataset is introduced to address data scarcity.

Result: FW-VTON yields superior results in both qualitative and quantitative tests and effectively performs in garment extraction tasks.

Conclusion: FW-VTON advances virtual try-on capabilities by innovating the person-to-person task, supported by a novel dataset and robust evaluations.

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

*Matteo Dunnhofer,Zaira Manigrasso,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the challenges in visual object tracking and segmentation in egocentric vision and introduces a benchmark to disentangle them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the actual causes of performance drop in egocentric vision tasks and whether they stem from the first-person perspective or the nature of human-object activities.

Method: The paper introduces a novel benchmark study and evaluation strategy to differentiate between challenges arising from egocentric viewpoints and those inherent to human-object activity understanding.

Result: The study provides a framework to identify the sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation more precisely.

Conclusion: Insights from the paper can guide targeted improvements in egocentric vision tasks by separating viewpoint and activity-based challenges.

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

### [104] [Optimization of DNN-based HSI Segmentation FPGA-based SoC for ADS: A Practical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16556)
*Jon Gutiérrez-Zaballa,Koldo Basterretxea,Javier Echanobe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimization techniques for deploying DNN-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation on FPGA-based systems for autonomous driving. It addresses challenges related to computational efficiency, preprocessing, and task distribution, achieving significant reductions in complexity and inference speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance autonomous navigation systems by improving the accuracy and robustness of vision-based detection and tracking in safety-critical environments using HSI integrated with edge platforms.

Method: A co-design approach involving task distribution across hardware/software, DNN model compression, hardware-aware preprocessing, and pipelined deployment on FPGA-based System-on-Chip (SoC).

Result: Compression reduced the DNN complexity to 24.34% of original operations and 1.02% of parameters, with a 2.86x inference speed-up while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques successfully optimize practical deployment of DNN-based HSI segmentation processors on FPGA-based SoC, making them more suitable for resource-constrained and latency-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper investigates massive and artifact tokens in vision transformers, and introduces Fast Nystr"om Attention (FNA) to approximate self-attention efficiently while reducing noise impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the inner workings of vision transformers and enhance their performance by addressing the behavior of massive and artifact tokens during inference.

Method: The authors introduce Fast Nystr"om Attention (FNA), a training-free method for self-attention approximation leveraging token patterns, along with a masking strategy to reduce noise from these tokens.

Result: The proposed methods show competitive performance across various tasks like retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question answering, with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: Exploiting the structured behavior of massive and artifact tokens can improve the efficiency and performance of vision transformers without additional training costs.

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

### [106] [Discovering and using Spelke segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16038)
*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Spelke objects, inspired by developmental psychology, as category-agnostic groupings of physical objects based on motion relationships. It proposes a method, SpelkeNet, for their detection and demonstrates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the visual segmentation task by focusing on Spelke objects, which are based on causal motion relationships and independent of object categories, to better support tasks like manipulation and planning.

Method: The paper introduces the SpelkeBench dataset for benchmarking Spelke objects and proposes SpelkeNet, a visual world model that predicts future motion distributions. By applying "statistical counterfactual probing" with virtual pokes, the method estimates motion affordance and expected displacement maps to define Spelke segments.

Result: SpelkeNet outperforms supervised segmentation baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on the new SpelkeBench benchmark. It also enhances object manipulation performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark when integrated into various models.

Conclusion: The study establishes the practical utility of Spelke objects in computer vision, demonstrating their advantages over traditional category-based segmentation methods for tasks requiring physical interaction and motion prediction.

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

### [107] [Disrupting Semantic and Abstract Features for Better Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16052)
*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAFER, a method to enhance adversarial transferability by disrupting both semantic and abstract features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-level attacks mainly manipulate semantic features, but CNNs focus on high-frequency components, which can be leveraged to improve adversarial transferability.

Method: The proposed SAFER method uses BLOCKMIX for image-level disruption and SELF-MIX for frequency spectrum adjustment to compute an improved weight matrix for feature disruption.

Result: Experiments on the ImageNet dataset show SAFER effectively boosts adversarial transferability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Balancing disruption in semantic and abstract features leads to enhanced adversarial attack transferability, making SAFER an effective approach.

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

*Parul Gupta,Abhinav Dhall,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in personalized image generation with inaccurate human poses, identity preservation, and unnatural gaze patterns by introducing feedback-based fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limitations in personalized image generation like incorrect human activities, identity preservation issues, and unnatural gaze behavior, and improve the quality of generated images.

Method: Proposes feedback-based fine-tuning using state-of-the-art detectors for pose, human-object interaction, facial recognition, and gaze estimation, integrated at variable timesteps in the diffusion model.

Result: Improvement demonstrated in human-object interactions, facial identity accuracy, and overall image quality across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Feedback-based fine-tuning enhances personalized image generation for complex scenarios and achieves better representation of human pose, identity, and gaze patterns.

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pusa, a new paradigm utilizing vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) in video diffusion models, achieving improved efficiency and versatility while maintaining task-agnostic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations in temporal modeling of video diffusion models, especially the inefficiencies and constraints posed by traditional approaches involving scalar timestep variables and task-specific adaptations.

Method: The authors introduced Vectorized Timestep Adaptation (VTA), a non-destructive technique that fine-tunes a base model to enable fine-grained temporal control while preserving the model's initial capabilities.

Result: The method achieves superior performance with drastically reduced computational and dataset requirements, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks in image-to-video generation and enabling new zero-shot multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Pusa establishes a robust, scalable, and efficient paradigm for video synthesis, offering high-fidelity video generation accessible to both the research community and industry stakeholders.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods in online long-sequence scenarios, where slow optimization or lack of incremental updates hinder performance.

Method: The authors propose LongSplat, which employs a streaming update mechanism and a Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR) to efficiently compress and manage 3D Gaussian data for real-time synthesis.

Result: LongSplat achieves a 44% reduction in Gaussian counts while maintaining efficiency-quality trade-offs, delivering real-time novel view synthesis and reconstruction.

Conclusion: LongSplat represents an advancement in online 3D Gaussian reconstruction, effectively handling long-sequence inputs without excessive memory or computational costs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for energy-efficient and high-temporal-resolution video understanding, leveraging the unique capabilities of spike cameras and enabling benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

Method: The paper develops and presents three datasets that preserve the sparsity and temporal precision of spike-based data, synchronized with RGB and thermal data, to facilitate multimodal action recognition benchmarking.

Result: The outcome is a novel dataset that enables direct comparisons between spike, thermal, and RGB modalities and supports energy-efficient video understanding research.

Conclusion: This work provides a unique platform for advancing video action recognition using spike cameras, promoting research in low-power, high-resolution multimodal video analysis.

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will
drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen), a method for improving text-to-image synthesis by scaling resolution directly in latent space, avoiding artifacts from traditional pixel-based scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address issues of artifacts and distortions caused by conventional methods of downscaling and upscaling during text-to-image generation.

Method: The proposed framework, LSSGen, uses a lightweight latent upsampler to scale resolutions directly in latent space, without altering the existing Transformer or U-Net architectures.

Result: LSSGen demonstrated enhanced efficiency and visual quality, achieving a notable improvement in the TOPIQ score of up to 246% when generating high-resolution images.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, offering improved perceptual quality and text-image alignment while supporting multi-resolution generation.

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in RGB-DSM data integration for semantic segmentation, which causes computational issues and degraded performance due to modality misalignment.

Method: Proposes the Asymmetric Multi-Modal Network (AMMNet) with three key designs: Asymmetric Dual Encoder (ADE), Asymmetric Prior Fuser (APF), and Distribution Alignment (DA) module.

Result: AMMNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets while reducing computational and memory demands.

Conclusion: AMMNet is robust, efficient, and improves semantic segmentation in remote sensing by overcoming multi-modal integration challenges.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AtrousMamba, a model addressing local feature extraction while preserving global context, outperforming existing methods in change detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Mamba's ability to effectively capture fine-grained local details while retaining its capacity for long-range dependencies, especially in visual data tasks.

Method: Incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism that progressively expands the scanning range with adjustable rates, integrating local and global information.

Result: AtrousMamba outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based methods across six benchmark datasets in binary and semantic change detection tasks.

Conclusion: AtrousMamba balances local and global feature extraction, demonstrating its capability for dense visual prediction and advancing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

### [117] [Explicit Context Reasoning with Supervision for Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16191)
*Fansheng Zeng,Bineng Zhong,Haiying Xia,Yufei Tan,Xiantao Hu,Liangtao Shi,Shuxiang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RSTrack, a new approach to enhance temporal consistency in visual tracking by explicitly modeling and supervising contextual reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream tracking algorithms struggle with effectively modeling a target’s evolving dynamics due to a lack of explicit supervision in the association of context across frames.

Method: The authors propose three mechanisms: (1) Context Reasoning Mechanism for temporal consistency using historical target states, (2) Forward Supervision Strategy to anchor reasoning output toward true target features, and (3) Efficient State Modeling to eliminate redundant information and suppress ineffective contextual associations.

Result: RSTrack delivers state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time speeds.

Conclusion: This paper effectively addresses the contextual association challenges in temporal modeling, thereby improving visual tracking performance and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EBench-18K, a large-scale benchmark with human preference annotations for evaluating text-guided image editing (TIE) models, and proposes LMM4Edit, a metric that aligns well with human perceptions of image editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIE models struggle with balancing image quality, editing alignment, and consistency, and existing evaluation benchmarks fail to scale or match human perception.

Method: They created EBench-18K, a dataset with 18K edited images, human-assessed metrics, and QA pairs. They also proposed LMM4Edit, a metric using large multi-modal models (LMMs) for comprehensive evaluation of TIE models across multiple dimensions.

Result: EBench-18K facilitated benchmarking of 17 state-of-the-art TIE models. LMM4Edit demonstrated outstanding performance, effectively aligning LMM assessment with human preferences and showing strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: EBench-18K and LMM4Edit provide significant advancements in the evaluation of TIE models and demonstrate reliable alignment with human perception, enabling broader applications and insights in TIE research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

### [119] [A Single-step Accurate Fingerprint Registration Method Based on Local Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16201)
*Yuwei Jia,Zhe Cui,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fingerprint registration method to address image distortion issues, proposing an end-to-end algorithm that directly predicts semi-dense matching points for single-step alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distortions in fingerprint images impact recognition performance, especially when image quality is low, which disrupts initial registration stages relying on minutiae.

Method: An end-to-end single-step algorithm is designed to directly predict semi-dense matching points between two fingerprints, leveraging global-local attentions for pixel-level alignment.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art matching performance in single-step registration and enhances performance when combined with dense registration algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates issues arising from low-quality images, minimizes registration failures, and improves fingerprint recognition efficiency.

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MVP-LM, a comprehensive framework for visual perception integrating word- and sentence-based tasks, as well as box and mask predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research often limits focus to specific subcategories of visual perception tasks, hindering versatility and broader applicability.

Method: The framework employs a multi-granularity decoder with dataset unification for multitask supervised fine-tuning, spanning tasks like segmentation and detection. It also uses a query enhancement strategy to leverage VLLM capabilities.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MVP-LM across diverse benchmarks, validating its capacity for handling word- and sentence-based perception tasks.

Conclusion: MVP-LM offers a versatile solution for integrating diverse visual perception tasks within one architecture, proving its efficacy and potential.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and
instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited
subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework
incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to
integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and
mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative
multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset
unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide
spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,
detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we
introduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and
generative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted
across a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception
tasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework. The code will be available at

*Jijun Wang,Yan Wu,Yujian Mo,Junqiao Zhao,Jun Yan,Yinghao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LDRFusion, a LiDAR-dominant fusion framework, to improve 3D object detection by initially using LiDAR data for proposals and incorporating pseudo-point clouds for enhanced detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-camera fusion methods face challenges with noisy pseudo point clouds and spatial sparsity, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: Stage 1 exclusively uses LiDAR for initial object proposals, and Stage 2 refines this with pseudo point clouds. A hierarchical residual encoding module is added to improve local structure representation.

Result: Their approach, tested on the KITTI dataset, shows consistently strong performance across various detection categories and difficulty levels.

Conclusion: LDRFusion effectively mitigates noise and enhances 3D detection by leveraging a LiDAR-first approach combined with improved pseudo point cloud processing.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D
object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our
framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories
and difficulty levels.

*Shreelekha Revankar,Utkarsh Mall,Cheng Perng Phoo,Kavita Bala,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MONITRS, a multimodal dataset containing temporal satellite imagery and natural language annotations to improve disaster monitoring capabilities using machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in current disaster monitoring tools, such as narrow focus, reliance on manual interpretation, and lack of comprehensive datasets.

Method: The authors developed the MONITRS dataset comprising 10,000 FEMA disaster events, featuring temporal satellite imagery, annotated news articles, geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs to enhance ML models.

Result: Fine-tuning machine learning models on the MONITRS dataset significantly improved disaster monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: MONITRS establishes a new benchmark for machine learning-assisted disaster monitoring systems, aiding in efficient disaster response.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite
imagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by
geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
existing MLLMs on our dataset yields significant performance improvements for
disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine
learning-assisted disaster response systems. Code can be found at:

### [123] [Positive Style Accumulation: A Style Screening and Continuous Utilization Framework for Federated DG-ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16238)
*Xin Xu,Chaoyue Ren,Wei Liu,Wenke Huang,Bin Yang,Zhixi Yu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Domain Generalization for Person Re-identification (FedDG-ReID), focusing on improving generalization by distinguishing between beneficial ('positive') and harmful ('negative') styles in distributed learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FedDG-ReID methods rely on style transformations to enhance diversity but fail to assess whether all styles contribute positively to generalization.

Method: The proposed Style Screening and Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework includes components like a Generalization Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM), style memory recognition loss, and a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to leverage and sustain positive styles efficiently.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that SSCU enhances model generalization in both source and target domains, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves model generalization by selectively leveraging positive styles and introducing dynamic and collaborative strategies for style utilization.

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

*Chi-Pin Huang,Yueh-Hua Wu,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Fu-En Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkAct is a framework enhancing vision-language-action reasoning by combining high-level reasoning and low-level action execution, achieving better adaptation and planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for VLA reasoning struggle with multi-step planning and dynamic task adaptation due to end-to-end training limitations.

Method: ThinkAct employs a dual-system framework that trains a multimodal language model to generate reasoning plans, integrates reinforced visual latent planning, and compresses plans into visual plan latents to guide action models.

Result: ThinkAct demonstrates improved adaptation, planning, and self-correction behavior across embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkAct effectively bridges reasoning and action in VLA tasks, paving the way for robust performance in complex, dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

*Chao Zhou,Tianyi Wei,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of text instruction neglect in unified image generation models, introducing a Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS) method to improve instruction-following fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation models, while simplifying multimodal tasks, struggle to effectively process complex text instructions containing multiple sub-instructions.

Method: The authors propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a technique that adjusts cross-attention activations dynamically based on consistency between adjacent timesteps, without requiring additional training or optimization.

Result: SaaS improves instruction-following fidelity in tasks like instruction-based image editing and visual conditional image generation, outperforming other existing methods.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the effectiveness of unified image generation models by addressing instruction neglect, presenting an efficient method validated through experiments and making it available as open-source code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliTracer, a framework for extracting vectorized geographic objects from large-size remote sensing imagery (RSI). Unlike existing methods, it avoids fragmented outputs by enhancing segmentation and employing advanced tools like the Context Attention Net (CAN) and Mask Contour Reformer (MCR). Extensive experiments show superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vector mapping of geographic objects often lose contextual information due to their reliance on small image patches, resulting in fragmented outputs. This paper seeks to address this limitation for large-size RSI.

Method: HoliTracer employs the Context Attention Net (CAN) for enhanced segmentation using local-to-global attention. It uses a pipeline integrating the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) for polygon reconstruction and the Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) for tracing vertices.

Result: Experiments on large-size RSI datasets show HoliTracer delivers state-of-the-art performance in extracting vectorized buildings, water bodies, and roads.

Conclusion: HoliTracer effectively holistically extracts vectorized geographic objects from large-size RSI, outperforming existing methods and enabling high-precision mapping.

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline to enhance object detection in fisheye cameras by identifying and addressing model blind spots using edge-case synthesis and synthetic data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras introduce distortions that challenge object detection models trained on conventional datasets, motivating the need to systematically address these challenges.

Method: Perform detailed error analysis to identify edge cases, fine-tune a generative model to synthesize failure-mode images, pseudo-label them using a high-quality detector, and integrate them into the training process.

Result: Consistent performance improvements were observed by addressing edge cases and leveraging synthetic data generated based on failure analysis.

Conclusion: A data-centric approach focusing on understanding and fixing weaknesses in specialized domains like fisheye object detection demonstrates significant performance gains.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges
to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.

*Futa Waseda,Saku Sugawara,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes QT-AFT, a method that improves adversarial robustness in vision-language models like CLIP by leveraging high-quality captions during training, addressing weaknesses in prior adversarial training approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods overlook the role of high-quality linguistic guidance, resulting in overfitting or suboptimal visual robustness against text-guided adversarial attacks.

Method: QT-AFT incorporates high-quality captions during adversarial fine-tuning to guide the visual encoder towards improved robustness by focusing on diverse semantics in images.

Result: QT-AFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy across 16 datasets, outperforming prior supervised and unsupervised approaches.

Conclusion: High-quality linguistic supervision is critical for robust visual representation learning, suggesting future work should emphasize integrating detailed language descriptions for enhanced resilience against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

### [129] [ToFe: Lagged Token Freezing and Reusing for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16260)
*Haoyue Zhang,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Token Freezing and Reusing (ToFe) framework to improve the efficiency of vision transformers by temporarily freezing and reusing less important tokens instead of discarding them permanently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of vision transformers caused by computationally intensive self-attention, and to adapt these models for resource-constrained devices by balancing performance and computational overhead.

Method: The proposed method, ToFe, involves identifying important tokens at each stage, freezing unimportant ones temporarily, and reusing them later using a prediction module and an approximate module. It uses computation budget-aware end-to-end training for adaptive processing of tokens.

Result: ToFe reduces the computational cost of the LV-ViT model by 50% while incurring less than a 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in performance-complexity trade-offs.

Conclusion: The ToFe framework effectively optimizes the vision transformer models by reducing computation and maintaining performance, making them more suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Junhao Su,Feiyu Zhu,Hengyu Shi,Tianyang Han,Yurui Qiu,Junfeng Luo,Xiaoming Wei,Jialin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAN++, a method using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and learnable scaling bias for improved supervised local learning in deep learning tasks. MAN++ enhances inter-block communication, achieving performance comparable to end-to-end training while reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning training methods, such as end-to-end backpropagation, face challenges including high memory consumption and limitations in biological plausibility. Supervised local learning seeks to address these issues but suffers from performance degradation due to limited inter-block communication.

Method: MAN++ employs the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for parameter interaction between network blocks and introduces a learnable scaling bias to address feature discrepancies. This approach enables dynamic interactions and improved information flow within the network.

Result: MAN++ demonstrates high performance levels comparable to end-to-end backpropagation on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. It achieves this while significantly lowering GPU memory consumption.

Conclusion: MAN++ provides a robust alternative to conventional training approaches, promising enhanced efficiency and feasibility for supervised local learning in deep learning models.

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

### [131] [Beyond Label Semantics: Language-Guided Action Anatomy for Few-shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16287)
*Zefeng Qian,Xincheng Yao,Yifei Huang,Chongyang Zhang,Jiangyong Ying,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Language-Guided Action Anatomy" (LGA), a framework for improving few-shot action recognition (FSAR) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and visual segmentation to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal details, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled data in few-shot action recognition and the limitations of action labels alone inspired the use of large language models to extract more nuanced spatiotemporal knowledge critical for recognizing subtle variations in actions.

Method: The proposed method uses LLMs to break down action labels into sequences of atomic descriptions (subject, motion, object) and combines this with a Visual Anatomy Module that segments actions into video phases. A fine-grained fusion strategy integrates these textual and visual features, and a Multimodal Matching mechanism ensures robust classification.

Result: The proposed LGA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSAR benchmarks by effectively integrating textual and visual atomic-level features.

Conclusion: LGA demonstrates that leveraging large language models and fine-grained multimodal integration can significantly enhance few-shot action recognition by capturing spatiotemporal nuances.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dens3R is a unified 3D foundation model that predicts geometric properties (e.g., depth, surface normals) from images by modeling their correlation, achieving consistent and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that predict geometric quantities (e.g., depth, surface normals) independently, often failing to achieve consistency and accuracy.

Method: Dens3R employs a two-stage training framework with a shared encoder-decoder backbone and position-interpolated rotary positional encoding. It integrates image-pair matching features and intrinsic invariance to jointly regress multiple geometric properties.

Result: Dens3R provides accurate and consistent geometric predictions from single to multi-view inputs, demonstrating superior performance across various 3D dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Dens3R is a robust and versatile 3D model that improves upon existing methods, with significant potential for diverse 3D applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

TL;DR: MotionShot introduces a training-free framework that achieves high-fidelity motion transfer while maintaining coherence in appearance and adapting to significant differences in structure or appearance between reference and target objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in transferring motion between reference and target objects with significant structural or appearance differences.

Method: MotionShot performs semantic feature matching for high-level alignments and uses shape retargeting for low-level morphological alignments. Temporal attention is employed to encode motion for coherent transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate MotionShot's capability of transferring motion coherently across objects with large appearance and structural disparities.

Conclusion: MotionShot provides an effective and training-free solution for high-fidelity motion transfer across diverse objects, resolving challenges in appearance and structural variance.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces M-SpecGene, a generalized model for RGBT multispectral vision, addressing modality biases and artificial inductive limitations through self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional case-by-case RGBT models, which suffer from artificial biases, modality challenges, and limited datasets.

Method: M-SpecGene uses a self-supervised approach to learn modality-invariant representations, leveraging a novel Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric and a GMM-CMSS progressive masking pretraining framework.

Result: Experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate M-SpecGene’s effectiveness and generalizability for four RGBT tasks.

Conclusion: M-SpecGene provides new insights into multispectral fusion by unifying case-by-case studies into a generalizable framework, improving perception in complex environments.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how environmental variables impact state-of-the-art Scene Text Detection and Recognition algorithms through wearable technology, presenting a novel dataset and optimizing OCR pipeline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable technologies, like smart glasses, offer new opportunities for Scene Text Detection and Recognition, but real-world performance inconsistencies due to environmental factors need investigation.

Method: A custom-built dataset is created under controlled conditions to assess the effects of lighting, distance, and resolution on two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN and EAST with PyTesseract. Pre-processing techniques like image upscaling and eye-gaze tracking are tested to optimize performance.

Result: Resolution and distance have significant effects on recognition accuracy, while lighting shows unpredictable results. Image upscaling reduces Character Error Rate from 0.65 to 0.48, and eye-gaze tracking improves efficiency by focusing on user attention zones.

Conclusion: The study benchmarks STDR algorithms under real-world conditions and highlights adaptive approaches for user-aware AR systems, paving the way for assistive applications like asset inspection and nutrition analysis.

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text
Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for
assistive and research-oriented applications, such as asset inspection and
nutrition analysis. The code is available at

*Xinyu Mao,Xiaohan Xing,Fei Meng,Jianbang Liu,Fan Bai,Qiang Nie,Max Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OP-SAM, a method for automated polyp segmentation using a single annotated image without requiring additional prompts, achieving significant performance improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional polyp segmentation methods face challenges like morphological variability, domain shifts, and dependence on large-scale annotations. The manual input of prompts for models like SAM adds to the labor and time cost.

Method: The proposed OP-SAM framework introduces three key innovations: Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer, Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) for addressing size variations and filtering noise, and Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement.

Result: On extensive evaluations across five datasets, OP-SAM demonstrates significant effectiveness, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 76.93% on the Kvasir dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 11.44%.

Conclusion: OP-SAM effectively addresses polyp segmentation limitations by automating the prompt generation process, reducing annotation burden, and demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.

*Mingtao Guo,Guanyu Xing,Yanci Zhang,Yanli Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FRVD model for generating realistic talking head videos, addressing limitations of prior methods in handling large pose changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face reenactment methods face challenges such as warping artifacts and coarse landmark limitations, especially under large pose variations.

Method: FRVD uses a motion extractor for keypoint alignment, a warping module for motion alignment, and a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) to map warped images into a motion-aware latent space for correction.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that FRVD achieves better pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality compared to existing methods, particularly in extreme pose scenarios.

Conclusion: FRVD demonstrates high-fidelity face reenactment, capable of handling large pose variations more effectively than previous approaches.

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mamba-OTR, a computationally efficient model for detecting Take and Release events in egocentric videos, showing superior performance and accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting Take and Release actions in untrimmed egocentric videos poses challenges like label imbalance, temporal prediction precision, and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose Mamba-OTR, leveraging temporal recurrence during inference, and incorporate focal loss and custom regularization to address training challenges and evaluation alignment.

Result: Mamba-OTR achieves significant accuracy improvements (e.g., mp-mAP scores of 45.48 and 43.35 in different modes compared to lower scores from baseline methods) and is efficient for online deployment.

Conclusion: Mamba-OTR provides a strong, efficient baseline for OTR tasks in egocentric videos, outperforming alternatives, and supports future research with open-source release.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.

Method: Proposes a unified, lightweight network integrating Perspective Transformation Correction (PTR) and AFLNet. Enhancements include improved attention modules in LPRNet and Focal Loss for training. The recognition process supervises correction via weak signals.

Result: LPTR-AFLNet shows high accuracy in correcting distortions and recognizing single/double-line license plates, performing effectively across various scenarios and running under 10ms on mid-range GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed LPTR-AFLNet effectively balances correction, recognition accuracy, and low computational demands, highlighting its practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

Motivation: The authors aim to solve the difficulty of integrating local and global features in point cloud registration due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships.

Method: The method employs Gestalt principles combined with advanced neural network components like Gestalt Feature Attention and Dual-path Multi-Granularity blocks to enhance feature communication and aggregation.

Result: Experiments across challenging tasks indicate that GPI-Net achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GPI-Net in feature-based correspondences for point cloud registration, and highlights its innovative design for local-global feature integration.

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Method: The paper introduces a dataset (STAR) with 54,738 flux-consistent image pairs generated through a flux-preserving pipeline. Additionally, it presents the FISR model and proposes a new Flux Error (FE) metric to evaluate SR models' physical accuracy.

Result: The proposed FISR model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods by 24.84% on a flux consistency metric. The STAR dataset also proved valuable for advancing field-level ASR model development.

Conclusion: The STAR dataset and FISR model advance the field of astronomical imaging by addressing flux inconsistency and providing tools for systematic development of SR models with better physical accuracy in astrophysics.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity (e.g., fMRI) bridges
neuroscience and computer vision by decoding neural representations. However,
existing methods often overlook critical brain structure-function
relationships, flattening spatial information and neglecting individual
anatomical variations. To address these issues, we propose (1) a novel sphere
tokenizer that explicitly models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D
spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,

### [143] [Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393)
*Lazaro Janier Gonzalez-Sole,Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot presentation attack detection (PAD) framework using foundation models to address the vulnerabilities in facial recognition systems caused by presentation attacks. It achieves superior generalization and performance on unknown presentation attack instruments compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, which allow malicious actors to impersonate authorized users and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Current PAD methods require extensive data but struggle to generalize to unknown attacks.

Method: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of foundation models in PAD scenarios and proposes a zero-shot PAD framework. This approach minimizes reliance on training data specifically containing presentation attacks and bona fide presentations.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the foundation models achieve superior performance in challenging scenarios with unknown 2D and 3D attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art PAD mechanisms using the SiW-Mv2 database.

Conclusion: Foundation models prove to be effective for zero-shot PAD, enabling better defense against unknown presentation attacks while reducing the dependence on extensive training data. These models show significant potential to enhance the robustness of facial recognition systems.

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

Result: ADCD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forgery localization by 20.79% on average across five types of image distortions.

Conclusion: ADCD-Net proves to be a robust tool for detecting forgeries in document images, offering significant advancements in performance and practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.

*Tanveer Younis,Zhanglin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey examines sparse-view 3D reconstruction using modern techniques like neural implicit models, point-cloud methods, and hybrid approaches to improve performance in challenging settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is critical for robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems where dense image acquisition is not viable, yet traditional methods struggle due to minimal image overlap.

Method: The paper reviews recent advances in neural implicit models, explicit point-cloud approaches, and hybrid methods, analyzing their use of geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference to address common issues.

Result: It provides comparative insights into the trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization of these methods based on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The survey highlights open challenges like domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and recommends exploring 3D-native generative priors and real-time reconstruction capabilities for future work.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

### [148] [Combined Image Data Augmentations diminish the benefits of Adaptive Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16427)
*Georg Siedel,Ekagra Gupta,Weijia Shao,Silvia Vock,Andrey Morozov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores adaptive label smoothing for various aggressive image augmentations like random erasing and noise injection, but highlights its limitations in more diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to expand the scope of adaptive label smoothing, a regularization technique, to aggressive augmentations other than random-crop and explore its constraints and benefits.

Method: They applied adaptive label smoothing to augmentations like random erasing and noise injection, analyzing its performance, particularly in scenarios involving diverse and homogeneous augmentation types.

Result: While the method improved performance when using homogeneous transformations like random erasing, it lost effectiveness with diverse transformations like those in TrivialAugment and was detrimental to robustness against corruptions.

Conclusion: Adaptive label smoothing is most beneficial when the training data is dominated by a restricted, uniform set of image transformations and not suitable for diverse augmentations.

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

*Lin Xi,Yingliang Ma,Cheng Wang,Sandra Howell,Aldo Rinaldi,Kawal S. Rhode*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, addressing noise issues of pseudo-labels by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation in medical images is costly and time-intensive, making semi-supervised segmentation techniques using limited labels and abundant unlabeled data vital.

Method: The method applies a diffusion-based framework focusing on latent space constraints through prototype-based contrastive consistency, leveraging class prototypes as anchors.

Result: Experiments on EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets show improved segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: This proposed diffusion model improves robustness and data efficiency in segmenting medical images, showing promise for various clinical applications.

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory limitation challenges in extending foundation models for large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction, particularly in outdoor settings.

Method: VGGT-Long employs a chunk-based processing strategy, overlapping alignment, and lightweight loop closure optimization, without relying on camera calibration, depth supervision, or model retraining.

Result: VGGT-Long demonstrates trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. It works successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models fail and produces accurate geometry across various conditions. Evaluations were conducted on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: VGGT-Long highlights the feasibility and potential of leveraging foundation models for scalable monocular 3D scene reconstruction in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for
autonomous driving scenarios. Code is available at

### [151] [DenseSR: Image Shadow Removal as Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16472)
*Yu-Fan Lin,Chia-Ming Lee,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of single-image shadow removal through a novel DenseSR framework to improve restoration quality, incorporating geometric-semantic priors and the Dense Fusion Block to achieve high fidelity in shadow removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shadow degradation hampers image quality and affects downstream applications. Existing methods struggle to recover shadow details while maintaining sharp boundaries, leading to inconsistent restoration and blurring.

Method: The proposed DenseSR uses geometric-semantic priors for shadow localization and introduces a Dense Fusion Block in the decoder, which employs two modules: ACSM for smooth appearances and TBRM for sharp boundary recovery.

Result: DenseSR improves restoration consistency and fidelity over existing methods in shadow removal, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DenseSR effectively addresses previous limitations in single-image shadow removal, enhancing image restoration quality with sharp boundaries and consistent appearances.

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images, demonstrating improved accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting cancer survival accurately by utilizing whole slide pathology images and improving upon existing state-of-the-art methods.

Method: The framework integrates (1) dynamic patch selection for prognostically relevant regions via quantile-based thresholding, (2) graph-guided k-means clustering to capture spatial and morphological heterogeneity, (3) attention mechanisms to contextualize local and global relationships, and (4) expert-guided Gaussian mixture modeling for complex survival distributions.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art results with a concordance index of 0.712 and 0.645, and Brier scores of 0.254 and 0.281 on renal and lung cancer datasets respectively (TCGA-KIRC and TCGA-LUAD).

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework significantly outperforms existing methods and shows high potential for predicting cancer-specific survival across different cancer types.

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method
across diverse cancer types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning classifications of herbarium images are disrupted by background noise; PlantSAM pipeline uses YOLOv10 and SAM2 for accurate segmentation, improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning efforts for herbarium image classification struggle due to background heterogeneity, which impairs accuracy and leads to misleading artifacts.

Method: The PlantSAM pipeline leverages YOLOv10 for bounding box prompts and SAM2 for plant segmentation, both fine-tuned on herbarium images and evaluated using IoU and Dice metrics.

Result: PlantSAM outperformed others by achieving an IoU of 0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97, enhancing classification performance with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%.

Conclusion: Background removal using PlantSAM significantly boosts classification models' accuracy by isolating foreground plant structures, proving its critical role in herbarium image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning-based classification of herbarium images is hampered by
background heterogeneity, which introduces noise and artifacts that can
potentially mislead models and reduce classification accuracy. Addressing these
background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We
introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10
for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for
segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing
segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and
evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics.
PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of
0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into
classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five
tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score
improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background
removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances
classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the
foreground plant structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes C2-Evo, a self-improving framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that evolves both data and models together to improve reasoning capabilities, achieving performance gains in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for high-quality vision-language datasets and overcome limitations of current self-improving methods which separately evolve data and models, leading to mismatches in task complexity.

Method: C2-Evo employs a dual-evolution approach: (1) a cross-modal data evolution loop to create complex problems by combining structured text and geometric diagrams, and (2) a data-model evolution loop to select problems based on model performance for further fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The C2-Evo framework demonstrated consistent and considerable performance improvements on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: By implementing an automatic and closed-loop evolution system for data and models, C2-Evo significantly enhances the ability of MLLMs to handle complex reasoning tasks, showcasing its potential contribution to the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

Motivation: To improve spatial awareness in 3D multimodal LLMs, which are currently limited in representing the richness of 3D scenes.

Method: Integrate a Large Language Model with a progressive spatial awareness scheme to enrich spatial embeddings, and introduce new tasks and a dataset for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various 3D vision-language tasks, showcasing deeper spatial information effectively mined.

Conclusion: Spatial 3D-LLM successfully overcomes current limitations by enriching spatial embeddings, which improves performance across diverse tasks and sets a new benchmark in 3D vision-language processing.

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel solution for large-scale 3D Earth modeling, using an expansive dataset and innovative architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods struggle to scale efficiently for modeling vast Earth surfaces like thousands of square kilometers.

Method: The authors present Aerial-Earth3D, a massive dataset of curated aerial scenes, and propose EarthCrafter, a framework utilizing sparse-decoupled latent diffusion with dual sparse 3D-VAEs and condition-aware flow matching models.

Result: EarthCrafter achieves superior performance in large-scale geographic terrain modeling and supports versatile applications, maintaining geographic plausibility.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advance in large-scale 3D Earth generation and sets the foundation for future research in geographic-scale modeling.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of poor off-the-shelf visual Chain of Thought performance and the lack of high-quality training data for multimodal reasoning models.

Method: The authors create Zebra-CoT, a diverse dataset covering tasks in scientific reasoning, 2D/3D visual inference, strategic games, and fine-tune existing models such as Anole-7B and Bagel-7B using this corpus.

Result: Fine-tuned models demonstrate a +12% improvement in test-set accuracy and up to +13% performance gains on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Moreover, Bagel-7B generates high-quality interleaved reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The Zebra-CoT dataset effectively supports the development of multimodal reasoning models, showcasing significant enhancement in visual Chain of Thought capabilities. The authors open-source their dataset and models to foster further research.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved

TL;DR: This paper discusses the PhaKIR challenge, aimed at enhancing instrument localization and procedural context understanding in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (RAMIS) using a unique dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the challenges of robust recognition and localization of surgical instruments under real-world conditions and to enhance the robustness and interpretability by incorporating surgical context.

Method: The PhaKIR challenge introduced a novel dataset with thirteen full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos annotated for three tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. This dataset uniquely supports the integration of temporal information and joint investigation of tasks.

Result: The results and findings were reported under the BIAS guidelines, and the challenge provided a benchmark for temporally-aware, context-driven methods in RAMIS.

Conclusion: The PhaKIR challenge offers a valuable resource and benchmark for advancing research in surgical scene understanding and developing contextually aware methods for RAMIS applications.

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,
context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support
future research in surgical scene understanding.

### [159] [A Multimodal Deviation Perceiving Framework for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16596)
*Wenbo Xu,Junyan Wu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a multimodal deviation perceiving (MDP) framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization in Deepfake detection, using video-level annotations only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Deepfake detection often involves restrictive, time-intensive methods that are difficult to scale for large datasets. Thus, there is a need for a more efficient and scalable solution.

Method: The researchers introduce a novel multimodal deviation perceiving (MDP) framework that employs multimodal interaction mechanisms (MI) and a deviation perceiving loss. These approaches facilitate refined temporal localization of forgery using both visual and audio modalities.

Result: The proposed framework effectively performs weakly-supervised forgery localization, demonstrating comparable performance to fully-supervised approaches in various metrics.

Conclusion: The MDP framework provides an efficient, scalable, and effective solution for temporal forgery localization, reducing dependency on complex supervision.

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

*Xueming Fu,Pei Wu,Yingtai Li,Xin Luo,Zihang Jiang,Junhao Mei,Jian Lu,Gao-Jun Teng,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dyna3DGR, a self-supervised framework for accurate tracking of 4D cardiac motion using a novel combination of 3D Gaussian representation and neural motion field modeling, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing cardiac motion tracking methods, which either lack topological consistency, depend heavily on training data (image-based), or lose image-level details (representation-based).

Method: The proposed method, Dyna3DGR, combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation with implicit neural motion field modeling, employing self-supervised optimization and differentiable volumetric rendering to ensure continuous motion representation and image-space alignment.

Result: Experiments on the ACDC dataset show the proposed approach achieves superior tracking accuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods.

Conclusion: Dyna3DGR offers a robust self-supervised solution for 4D cardiac motion tracking, addressing previous limitations and demonstrating effectiveness without reliance on extensive training data.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The
code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/Dyna3DGR.

*Haoyang Su,Shaohao Rui,Jinyi Xiang,Lianming Wu,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CTSL, a self-supervised framework for predicting cardiac events from MRI data without requiring contrast agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods for cardiac event prediction, which heavily depend on contrast agents and segmentation masks.

Method: CTSL decouples spatial and temporal features using multi-view distillation, teacher-student models, and codebook-based representations.

Result: The approach captures dynamic motion patterns, enabling high-confidence MACE risk predictions that outperform conventional methods.

Conclusion: CTSL provides a faster, non-invasive, and effective solution for cardiac risk assessment without contrast dependency, improving clinical accessibility.

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction
from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASaRG, a method to enhance clinical report generation by utilizing segmentation maps and intermediate features within the LLaVA framework, achieving improved performance and groundedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate radiologists' workloads and provide reliable second opinions to clinicians or patients through generating trustworthy clinical reports.

Method: ASaRG integrates intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps from radiological models into the multi-modal projection layer of the LLaVA architecture via concatenation.

Result: ASaRG achieves up to +2.77% performance improvement in CE F1 score compared to the baseline LLaVA, and outperforms other methods (COMG and ORID) by 6.98% and 6.28%, respectively.

Conclusion: ASaRG provides better accuracy in clinical report generation and enhances grounding capabilities, offering potential compatibility with other architectural advancements in the field.

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

*Meng Lou,Yunxiang Fu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A2Mamba is a novel Transformer-Mamba hybrid network leveraging multi-scale attention maps to achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the competitive performance of existing Transformer-Mamba architectures, they lack an interaction mechanism between Transformer and Mamba layers, hindering deep integration.

Method: The study introduces A2Mamba with a new token mixer called MASS, which incorporates Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Models (A2SSM). This mechanism uses cross-attention to enhance spatial dependencies and improve dynamic modeling.

Result: A2Mamba achieved 86.1% top-1 ImageNet-1K accuracy, surpassed prior models in semantic segmentation by 2.5% mIoU, and improved object detection and segmentation performance with greater efficiency and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: A2Mamba demonstrates the potential of tightly integrating Transformers and Mamba layers, setting a new benchmark in visual recognition tasks and providing publicly available code for further research.

Abstract: Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

*Jonathan Henrich,Christian Post,Maximilian Zilke,Parth Shiroya,Emma Chanut,Amir Mollazadeh Yamchi,Ramin Yahyapour,Thomas Kneib,Imke Traulsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two datasets, PigDetect and PigTrack, to benchmark object detection and multi-object tracking tasks for pig farming and shows that well-curated datasets lead to effective monitoring models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for automated methods to monitor individual pig behavior for welfare and management, addressing the lack of systematic benchmarking in object detection and tracking in pig farming.

Method: The authors created two datasets from realistic barn images and videos, testing object detection and tracking techniques under challenging conditions such as occlusions. They compare state-of-the-art and real-time models for their performance.

Result: Challenging training images boosted model performance, state-of-the-art methods outperformed real-time models in detection, and while SORT-based methods excelled in detection performance, end-to-end models were stronger in association tasks.

Conclusion: High-quality datasets and appropriate models generalize well in unseen environments. Publicly available datasets and code are provided to enhance reproducibility and progress in automated animal monitoring.

Abstract: To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.

*Shuang Song,Yang Tang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-effective method to enhance geographic generalization in building segmentation models using tailored synthetic data for test-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle to generalize across diverse geographic regions due to variations in building layouts and lack of annotated data for global diversity.

Method: The authors propose a test-time re-training using geo-typical synthetic data generated via procedural modeling, utilizing geospatial inputs like street networks and integrating these into an adversarial domain adaptation framework.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements of up to 12% in building segmentation accuracy across different domain gaps.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a scalable solution to improve generalization in remote sensing building segmentation, leveraging synthetic imagery alongside geographic knowledge without relying heavily on real-world annotations.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.

*Sos Agaian,Vladimir Frants*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Quaternion Retinex formulation to improve image decomposition in low light, addressing flaws in classic Retinex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve computer-vision accuracy for images taken in low-light conditions by addressing flaws in traditional Retinex theory, which struggles with color accuracy and stability.

Method: The methodology involves rewriting the image decomposition process using Quaternion Retinex based on Hamilton product to handle color channels collectively while introducing Reflectance Consistency Index for assessment.

Result: Tests demonstrated improvements of 2-11% in tasks like crack inspection, face detection, and infrared-visible fusion with enhanced color fidelity, lower noise, and higher stability.

Conclusion: The Quaternion Retinex approach resolves limitations in classic Retinex models, leading to better image enhancement and stability, especially for low-light applications.

Abstract: Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MpGI, a method to generate high-quality captions for remote sensing images, addressing limitations of existing datasets. A new dataset (HQRS-IT-210K) is developed for training improved VLFM models for captioning and image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in the quality of existing large-scale remote sensing image-text datasets, which rely on rudimentary caption-generation methods and offer modest performance improvements.

Method: The proposed MpGI method generates captions in two stages: (1) creating distinct and detailed descriptions from multiple perspectives using multimodal LLMs, and (2) integrating these descriptions into comprehensive captions using large language models (LLMs).

Result: The HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models, fine-tuned on the new HQRS-IT-210K dataset, achieved superior performance in various downstream tasks, surpassing previous SOTA models with significantly less training data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves RS image captioning quality and downstream task performance, marking a significant advancement in applying VLFMs to remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Chenxiao Fan,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation (TCVideoRS) to handle dynamically changing object relevance in video segmentation based on temporal text queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video segmentation rely on predefined object categories and cannot address complex, dynamic, and variable scenarios where objects appear or gain importance based on contextual changes, such as surgical procedures.

Method: Introduces a new task formulation called temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation and develops an automated method to create benchmarks without manual annotation.

Result: Developed TCVideoRSBenchmark, a dataset with 52 samples derived from the MVOR dataset, catering to the temporally-constrained video RS formulation.

Conclusion: The paper extends video segmentation to dynamically changing real-world scenarios, showcasing the viability of addressing temporal reasoning and scalability challenges in video analysis.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inpainting methods struggle to integrate new content seamlessly and maintain style and structure coherence, often requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

Method: HarmonPaint uses masking strategies in self-attention of diffusion models to ensure structural fidelity and transfers style information to harmonize inpainted regions without retraining.

Result: Experiments demonstrate HarmonPaint's effectiveness across various scenes and styles, showcasing its versatility and high performance.

Conclusion: HarmonPaint establishes a new inpainting paradigm by delivering harmonious results without training, making it adaptable and efficient for diverse applications.

Abstract: Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning
to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.

*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Xiwei Zhang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFR framework integrates visual, textual, and audio modalities using SAM to enhance few-shot segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation methods primarily rely on mono- or dual-modal paradigms, underutilizing the rich multi-modal information in real-world settings.

Method: The paper proposes DFR with innovations like decomposing multi-modal inputs, fusing them using contrastive learning, and reconstructing data through semantic guidance and geometric cues.

Result: Experiments confirm DFR’s significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world tests.

Conclusion: DFR effectively enhances semantic understanding and segmentation accuracy by utilizing multi-modal guidance in few-shot segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance

*Keneni W. Tesema,Lyndon Hill,Mark W. Jones,Gary K. L. Tam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses point cloud completion for noisy and occluded environments with a new framework (DWCNet) and dataset (CPCCD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud completion networks struggle with real-world degradations due to noise and occlusions, particularly as they are often trained on synthetic data. There is a need to handle these challenges in practical applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: The authors introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD) to benchmark robustness against diverse degradations and propose DWCNet, which incorporates a Noise Management Module (NMM) leveraging contrastive learning and self-attention for denoising and structural modeling.

Result: DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets under both clean and corrupted conditions, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: DWCNet effectively addresses the challenges of denoising and completing highly corrupted partial point clouds, and the CPCCD provides a valuable benchmark for robustness. The publicly available dataset and code will foster further research.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and
code will be publicly available at

### [172] [CMP: A Composable Meta Prompt for SAM-Based Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16753)
*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Chunjin Yang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) challenges by introducing the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in CD-FSS tasks caused by limited data and domain shifts, and to build on the zero-shot generalization capabilities of recent foundation models like SAM.

Method: The proposed CMP framework uses three modules: Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) for expanding semantics, Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) for automated prompt creation, and Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) for mitigating domain discrepancies.

Result: CMP achieved state-of-the-art performance with 71.8% and 74.5% mIoU for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively, across four cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The CMP framework provides an effective solution for CD-FSS by addressing the need for automation in prompt generation and improving cross-domain segmentation performance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to
limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction
(FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four
cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving
71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.

### [173] [Faithful, Interpretable Chest X-ray Diagnosis with Anti-Aliased B-cos Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16761)
*Marcel Kleinmann,Shashank Agnihotri,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancements to B-cos networks to improve their explanation clarity for chest X-ray analysis, enabling artifact-free interpretations critical for clinical applications while extending their use for multi-label settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability and faithfulness are crucial for deploying deep learning models in medical imaging, but existing methods like standard B-cos models are limited due to explanation artifacts and incompatibility with multi-label tasks.

Method: The study introduces anti-aliasing techniques (using FLCPooling and BlurPool) and adapts the B-cos networks to multi-label classification settings, with experiments conducted on chest X-ray datasets.

Result: Enhanced $	ext{B-cos}_	ext{FLC}$ and $	ext{B-cos}_	ext{BP}$ models maintain strong predictive performance while producing artifact-free, interpretable explanation maps suitable for clinical use.

Conclusion: This paper successfully resolves key limitations in B-cos networks, enabling their practical deployment in clinical applications by improving explanation clarity and supporting multi-label classification.

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

### [174] [Task-Specific Zero-shot Quantization-Aware Training for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16782)
*Changhao Li,Xinrui Chen,Ji Wang,Kang Zhao,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a task-specific zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) framework for object detection aimed at enhancing the performance of quantized detection networks using synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitation of traditional quantization methods which rely on access to original training data, and improve the performance of existing Zero-shot Quantization methods for object detection using task-specific synthetic data.

Method: The authors proposed a new ZSQ framework with two main stages: (1) synthesizing a task-specific calibration set through bounding box and category sampling strategy from a pre-trained network; (2) integrating task-specific training in the quantization process via knowledge distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets showcased the state-of-the-art efficiency and performance of the proposed method for quantized detection networks.

Conclusion: The proposed task-specific ZSQ framework achieves higher efficiency and accuracy for quantized object detection networks, addressing limitations of existing methods by incorporating task-specific synthetic data and training strategies.

Abstract: Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

### [175] [Enhancing Domain Diversity in Synthetic Data Face Recognition with Dataset Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16790)
*Anjith George,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the performance gap of face recognition models trained on synthetic data, proposing a combined synthetic dataset to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical and privacy concerns arise from using web-crawled, real-world face data in model training. Synthetic datasets provide an alternative but suffer from performance limitations.

Method: The paper combines two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets, each generated using different backbones, to mitigate artifacts, enhance data diversity, and regularize models.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves performance on standard face recognition benchmarks compared to models trained on individual synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic datasets effectively overcomes model-specific biases, demonstrating the feasibility of using purely synthetic data for competitive face recognition.

Abstract: While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.

### [176] [HOComp: Interaction-Aware Human-Object Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16813)
*Dong Liang,Jinyuan Jia,Yuhao Liu,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOComp, a novel method for seamless human-object interaction compositions, addressing shortcomings of existing techniques, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a new dataset, IHOC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-guided composition methods often fail at achieving seamless human-object interactions while maintaining natural blending and consistent appearances.

Method: The method involves two key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG) for identifying interaction types and providing pose constraints and (2) Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP) for maintaining consistent shapes, textures, and backgrounds.

Result: HOComp generates harmonious human-object interactions, ensuring consistent appearances and surpassing existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: HOComp demonstrates a significant advancement in interaction-aware composition tasks, validated by the results on the newly proposed IHOC dataset.

Abstract: While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Zihao Chen,Mohammad Goudarzi,Adel Nadjaran Toosi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to evaluate Kubernetes resilience in hybrid cloud-edge environments using fault injection and workload generation tools, producing a comprehensive dataset for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in resilience assessments of Kubernetes under realistic fault conditions in hybrid cloud-edge environments.

Method: The framework integrates fault injection tools (Chaos Mesh, Gremlin, ChaosBlade) with traffic simulation for automated fault scenario orchestration and resilience testing.

Result: Generated a 30 GB resilience dataset from 11,965 fault injection scenarios, revealing cloud-edge deployments are 80% more stable under network issues and clouds are 47% better under bandwidth constraints.

Conclusion: The findings offer quantitative insights into resilience aspects of Kubernetes in varying cloud-edge deployments, aiding architectural decisions.

Abstract: Kubernetes has emerged as an essential platform for deploying containerised
applications across cloud and edge infrastructures. As Kubernetes gains
increasing adoption for mission-critical microservices, evaluating system
resilience under realistic fault conditions becomes crucial. However,
systematic resilience assessments of Kubernetes in hybrid cloud-edge
environments are currently limited in research. To address this gap, a novel
resilience evaluation framework integrates mainstream fault injection tools
with automated workload generation for comprehensive cloud-edge Kubernetes
testing. Multiple fault injection platforms, including Chaos Mesh, Gremlin, and
ChaosBlade are combined with realistic traffic simulation tools, enabling
automated orchestration of complex failure scenarios. Through this framework,
comprehensive experiments are conducted that systematically target node-level,
pod-level, and network failures across cloud and cloud-edge environments. The
first comprehensive resilience dataset for hybrid cloud-edge Kubernetes
deployments is created, comprising over 30 GB of performance data from 11,965
fault injection scenarios including response times, failure rates, and error
patterns. Analysis reveals that cloud-edge deployments demonstrate 80% superior
response stability under network delay and partition conditions, while cloud
deployments exhibit 47% better resilience under bandwidth limitations,
providing quantitative guidance for architectural decision-making in cloud-edge
deployments.

*Andrei-Leonard Nicusan,Dominik Werner,Simon Branford,Simon Hartley,Andrew J. Morris,Kit Windows-Yule*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: AcceleratedKernels.jl is a library for parallel computing in Julia, supporting various accelerators, achieving exceptional performance and composability for HPC tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a backend-agnostic library for efficient, high-performing, and user-friendly parallel computing across different accelerator platforms.

Method: The library employs a unique transpilation architecture within a unified, compact Julia codebase that supports both CPUs and GPUs for tasks like arithmetic-heavy kernels and co-processing.

Result: Benchmarks show parity with optimized CPU implementations, achieving up to 855 GB/s in sorting tasks across 200 GPUs, highlighting NVLink's crucial role in cost-effective communication-heavy HPC tasks.

Conclusion: AcceleratedKernels.jl demonstrates exceptional performance scalability, composability, and economic viability as a parallel computing solution for modern HPC environments.

Abstract: AcceleratedKernels.jl is introduced as a backend-agnostic library for
parallel computing in Julia, natively targeting NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple
accelerators via a unique transpilation architecture. Written in a unified,
compact codebase, it enables productive parallel programming with minimised
implementation and usage complexities. Benchmarks of arithmetic-heavy kernels
show performance on par with C and OpenMP-multithreaded CPU implementations,
with Julia sometimes offering more consistent and predictable numerical
performance than conventional C compilers. Exceptional composability is
highlighted as simultaneous CPU-GPU co-processing is achievable - such as
CPU-GPU co-sorting - with transparent use of hardware-specialised MPI
implementations. Tests on the Baskerville Tier 2 UK HPC cluster achieved
world-class sorting throughputs of 538-855 GB/s using 200 NVIDIA A100 GPUs,
comparable to the highest literature-reported figure of 900 GB/s achieved on
262,144 CPU cores. The use of direct NVLink GPU-to-GPU interconnects resulted
in a 4.93x speedup on average; normalised by a combined capital, running and
environmental cost, communication-heavy HPC tasks only become economically
viable on GPUs if GPUDirect interconnects are employed.

### [180] [Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness for Blockchain Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16350)
*Serdar Metin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm called Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness (ADRF) for managing multiple resource types in blockchain systems efficiently, using a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource allocation in blockchain-based systems has primarily been studied for single resource types or standardized bundles. There is a need for fair and efficient allocation methods tailored for multiple resource types with heterogeneous demands.

Method: The paper adapts the Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness algorithm into a blockchain-compatible version called Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness, optimized for gas-cost constraints and designed to handle numerous resource types and users.

Result: The proposed algorithm was tested empirically, and it was found to be gas-efficient and capable of managing resources for hundreds of resource types and an unlimited number of users.

Conclusion: Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness serves as an efficient and scalable solution for multi-resource allocation in blockchain systems, reducing gas costs while ensuring fairness.

Abstract: Blockchain systems have been a part of mainstream academic research, and a
hot topic at that. It has spread to almost every subfield in the computer
science literature, as well as economics and finance. Especially in a world
where digital trust is much sought for, blockchains offer a rich variety of
desired properties, such as immutability, public auditing, decentralised record
keeping, among others. Not only has it been a research topic of its own, the
integration of blockchains into other systems has been proposed as solutions in
many areas, ranging from grid computing, cloud and fog computing, to internet
of things, self driving vehicles , and smart cities. In many cases the primary
function attributed to blockchains in these contexts is resource management.
Although much attention is paid to this topic, the focus is on single resource
allocation scenarios. Even the cases where multiple resource types are to be
allocated, are treated as single resource type scenarios, and problems are
formulated as allocating standardised bundles consisting of a fixed amount of
each of them, such as virtual machines. The present study addresses the problem
of allocating multiple resource types among tasks with heterogeneous resource
demands with a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource
Fairness; an algorithm that approximates Dominant Resource Fairness, without
loop iterations, which makes it preferable in the blockchain context because of
the block gas limit. We present the resulting algorithm, Autonomous Dominant
Resource Fairness, along with the empirical data collected from the tests run
on the algorithm. The results show that Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness
is a gas-cost efficient algorithm, which can be used to manage hundreds of
resource types for unlimited number of users.

Conclusion: FOGNITE enhances autonomy and efficiency in smart grids, facilitating proactive optimization for sustainable energy infrastructures.

Abstract: Modern smart grids demand fast, intelligent, and energy-aware computing at
the edge to manage real time fluctuations and ensure reliable operation. This
paper introduces FOGNITE Fog-based Grid In intelligence with Neural Integration
and Twin based Execution a next-generation fog cloud framework designed to

FOGNITE combines three core components: federated learning, reinforcement
learning, and digital twin validation. Each fog node trains a local CNN LSTM
model on private energy consumption data, enabling predictive intelligence
while preserving data privacy through federated aggregation. A reinforcement
learning agent dynamically schedules tasks based on current system load and
energy conditions, optimizing for performance under uncertainty.
  To prevent unsafe or inefficient decisions, a hierarchical digital twin layer
simulates potential actions before deployment, significantly reducing execution
errors and energy waste. We evaluate FOGNITE on a real world testbed of
Raspberry Pi devices, showing up to a 93.7% improvement in load balancing
accuracy and a 63.2% reduction in energy waste compared to conventional
architectures. By shifting smart grid control from reactive correction to
proactive optimization, FOGNITE represents a step toward more intelligent,
adaptive, and sustainable energy infrastructures

Result: The survey organizes various approaches under distinct categories, identifies key datasets and benchmarks, and highlights deployment strategies suited for edge-cloud intelligence systems.

Conclusion: It establishes a systematic foundation for efficient cooperation between LLMs and SLMs, promoting scalable and trustworthy edge-cloud intelligence solutions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, deploying them solely in the cloud or
compressing them for edge devices has become inadequate due to concerns about
latency, privacy, cost, and personalization. This survey explores a
collaborative paradigm in which cloud-based LLMs and edge-deployed small
language models (SLMs) cooperate across both inference and training. We present
a unified taxonomy of edge-cloud collaboration strategies. For inference, we
categorize approaches into task assignment, task division, and mixture-based
collaboration at both task and token granularity, encompassing adaptive
scheduling, resource-aware offloading, speculative decoding, and modular
routing. For training, we review distributed adaptation techniques, including
parameter alignment, pruning, bidirectional distillation, and
small-model-guided optimization. We further summarize datasets, benchmarks, and
deployment cases, and highlight privacy-preserving methods and vertical
applications. This survey provides the first systematic foundation for LLM-SLM
collaboration, bridging system and algorithm co-design to enable efficient,
scalable, and trustworthy edge-cloud intelligence.

Method: The paper benchmarks cooling approaches (liquid vs. air) using HGX nodes with NVIDIA H100 GPUs, evaluating thermal, power, and computation data using tools like GPU Burn and IPMItool.

Result: Liquid-cooled systems achieved GPU temperatures of 41-50°C, 17% higher performance (54 TFLOPs vs. 46 TFLOPs), better performance-per-watt, and lower energy overhead compared to air-cooled systems.

Conclusion: Liquid cooling improves thermal stability and energy efficiency, addressing sustainability challenges in hyperscale data centers and presenting benefits for AI workloads.

Abstract: The unprecedented growth in artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, recently
dominated by large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs),
has intensified power and cooling demands in data centers. This study
benchmarks LLMs and VLMs on two HGX nodes, each with 8x NVIDIA H100 graphics
processing units (GPUs), using liquid and air cooling. Leveraging GPU Burn,
Weights and Biases, and IPMItool, we collect detailed thermal, power, and
computation data. Results show that the liquid-cooled systems maintain GPU
temperatures between 41-50 degrees Celsius, while the air-cooled counterparts
fluctuate between 54-72 degrees Celsius under load. This thermal stability of
liquid-cooled systems yields 17 percent higher performance (54 TFLOPs per GPU
vs. 46 TFLOPs per GPU), improved performance per watt, reduced energy overhead,
and greater system efficiency than the air-cooled counterparts. These findings
underscore the energy and sustainability benefits of liquid cooling, offering a
compelling path forward for hyperscale data centers s

TL;DR: The Fast-VAT algorithm improves the performance of the original VAT implementation by increasing the speed and optimizing memory usage, achieving up to a 50x speedup while maintaining result quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard VAT implementation has significant limitations in computational efficiency and memory usage, hindering its widespread application for assessing cluster structures in datasets.

Method: Fast-VAT employs Numba's JIT compilation and Cython's low-level optimizations to enhance the performance and memory handling of the VAT algorithm.

Result: Fast-VAT achieves up to 50x speedup compared to the original VAT algorithm, while validating its accuracy across multiple datasets using statistical measures and PCA/t-SNE dimensionality reduction techniques.

Conclusion: Fast-VAT provides a more efficient and scalable alternative to the original VAT algorithm, making it suitable for analyzing cluster tendencies in larger datasets without sacrificing reliability.

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised
technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.
However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance
limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In
this work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT
algorithm in Python, augmented with Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and
Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach
achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving
the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of
real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify
subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and
t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering
results from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.

Result: STWeaver achieves an average reduction of fragmentation ratio by 79.2% (up to 100%) and improves training performance by up to 32.5%, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: STWeaver minimizes memory fragmentation and optimizes GPU usage, allowing more efficient training setups and making optimization techniques for large language models more practical.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

*Jun-Wei Zeng,Jerry Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAPS, a transparent framework for college admissions, using multi-modal metrics like academic scores, essay quality, and extracurricular impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety in traditional holistic college admissions evaluations.

Method: CAPS employs metrics like SAS, EQI, and EIS, along with techniques such as transformer embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression.

Result: CAPS showed strong performance, achieving high EQI prediction R^2, classification accuracy, and F1 scores in experiments on synthetic data.

Conclusion: CAPS offers a transparent, equitable, and data-driven alternative to traditional admissions practices.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a
novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret
holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles
into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized
Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and
extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging
transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression,
CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human
judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong
performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy
over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS
addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the
opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way
for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

*John Wu,Adam Cross,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDMA is a framework improving the identification of rare diseases in EHR by reducing privacy risks and enhancing efficiency, available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in identifying rare diseases in electronic health records due to limitations in standard ICD coding systems and current computational methods.

Method: Proposing RDMA, a local framework that mimics clinical reasoning by connecting disparate clinical observations, handling medical abbreviations, and identifying implicit mentions of rare diseases.

Result: RDMA achieves a 30% improvement in F1 performance and a 10x reduction in inference costs, addressing privacy concerns by avoiding cloud processing.

Conclusion: RDMA offers a secure and efficient method for clinicians to identify rare diseases earlier while preserving patient privacy and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using
cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems,
supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. Available at

### [188] [An open dataset of neural networks for hypernetwork research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15869)
*David Kurtenbach,Lior Shamir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of neural networks for hypernetworks research, consisting of 10,000 LeNet-5 models trained for binary classification, along with analysis showing their differentiability by machine learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypernetworks, which generate model weights for neural networks, have transformative potential but remain understudied due to resource constraints. The aim is to provide a foundational resource for advancing hypernetwork research.

Method: Generated a dataset of 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks using a large computing cluster, each trained for binary classification on ImageNette V2 classes. Supervised machine learning was used to assess differences between the neural networks.

Result: The dataset shows that the neural networks can be classified with 72.0% accuracy, demonstrating distinguishable differences identifiable by supervised learning models.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a valuable open resource to accelerate hypernetworks research, addressing the gap in available tools and datasets for this domain.

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

*Jayesh Choudhari,Piyush Kumar Singh,Douglas McIlwraith,Snehal Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods for complex multiclass classification tasks in real-world commercial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive evaluation for APO methods in complex, real-world classification tasks rather than limited benchmark datasets.

Method: The paper introduces APE-OPRO, a hybrid framework combining APE and OPRO, and benchmarks it against other methodologies like ProTeGi, focusing on cost and performance trade-offs.

Result: APE-OPRO improves cost-efficiency by 18% over OPRO with no performance compromise and achieves a balance between efficiency, performance, and scalability.

Conclusion: APE-OPRO highlights key trade-offs in APO methods while offering insights and a base for future research in advanced prompt optimization scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt design is a critical factor in the effectiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs), yet remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale.
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass
classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only
on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.
  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the
complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better
cost-efficiency, around $18\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing
performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and
gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.
  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute
performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted
in~\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between
performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation
studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to
label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These
findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial
applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label,
vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios.

*Jaehoon Yoo,Wonjung Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a method to improve sampling speeds in Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) by reducing factorization error and enabling efficient few-step data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFMs excel at generating high-quality discrete data but are hindered by slow sampling speeds due to iterative decoding processes, which stem from factorization approximations.

Method: The authors propose ReDi, which rectifies the coupling between source and target distributions to reduce factorization error. They also prove that each step of ReDi decreases Conditional Total Correlation (TC) and ensure convergence.

Result: The ReDi method empirically reduces Conditional TC, allows for efficient few-step samples, and supports training effective one-step models for discrete data generation.

Conclusion: ReDi provides a simple, theoretically grounded solution to the challenge of enabling efficient sampling in DFMs, offering a robust approach to discrete data synthesis.

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

### [191] [Improving the Generation of VAEs with High Dimensional Latent Spaces by the use of Hyperspherical Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15900)
*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Variational autoencoders (VAE) struggle to generate meaningful data from random latent vectors in high dimensions. This paper proposes a hyperspherical coordinate system for latent variables, improving VAE performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAEs often fail in generating meaningful data when latent vectors are randomly sampled in high-dimensional spaces, due to the uniform distribution on a hypersphere.

Method: Introduced a hyperspherical coordinate system for VAE latent variables, compressing latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere to address latent sparsity issues.

Result: Reduction in latent sparsity and improved data generation ability for VAEs, without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: Reparameterizing latent spaces in VAEs using hyperspherical coordinates enhances generation ability, especially in high-dimensional spaces, with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a
random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data,
at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper,
we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:
in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction
distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent
variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing
the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the
latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the
VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited
computational overhead.

*Andrea Alamiaa,Sabine Muzellec,Thomas Serre,Rufin VanRullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network mechanism that combines Transformer attention mechanisms with neuroscience theories to improve classification tasks, particularly in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional Transformer and convolutional neural networks, specifically in improving noise robustness and multi-classification tasks by leveraging insights from neuroscience.

Method: The authors incorporate angular phase alignment inspired by neuroscience's "binding by synchrony" theory into convolutional networks and use Kuramoto dynamics to synchronize and modulate neuron interactions based on their phases.

Result: The proposed mechanism demonstrates better accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization on two datasets: pairs of digits and superimposed MNIST and CIFAR-10 images, compared to traditional CNNs.

Conclusion: The study effectively enhances neural networks' ability to address the visual binding problem by integrating neuroscience-inspired mechanisms, showing potential for improved machine learning systems.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Verilog code, emphasizing real-world complexity and rigorous verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to represent real-world hardware design complexity, leading to the need for more comprehensive testing frameworks for Verilog code generation by LLMs.

Method: RealBench includes real-world open-source IP designs, formatted specifications, and rigorous verification setups, addressing both module-level and system-level tasks to evaluate LLMs.

Result: Evaluations showed that top-performing LLMs like o1-preview performed poorly, achieving only 13.3% pass@1 for module-level tasks and 0% for system-level tasks.

Conclusion: Stronger Verilog generation models are necessary as current LLMs struggle with real-world complexity. RealBench serves as a critical tool for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)
has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in
replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity,
inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments.
To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming
at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex,
structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design
specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line
coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and
system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities.
Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the
best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level
tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, highlighting the need for stronger Verilog
generation models in the future. The benchmark is open-sourced at

*Siyuan Liu,Wenjing Liu,Zhiwei Xu,Xin Wang,Bo Chen,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalMit, a black-box framework for detecting hallucinations in intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs), using a probabilistic fractal sampling technique without requiring white-box access to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over hallucinations generated by LLMs make intelligent agents less credible for deployment in real-world scenarios, necessitating effective detection and mitigation methods.

Method: The approach involves using HalMit, a black-box watchdog framework that leverages probabilistic fractal sampling to identify hallucinations by profiling the generalization bounds of LLM-powered agents.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that HalMit outperforms existing methods in hallucination detection, establishing its reliability and efficiency as a black-box solution.

Conclusion: HalMit's superior performance and independence from white-box access positions it as a robust technique for ensuring the dependability of intelligent agents in real-world applications.

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

TL;DR: Flash-ABFT is a novel method ensuring fault tolerance in attention mechanism accelerators with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient error detection in hardware accelerators for Transformers and LLMs stems from random faults arising during computation.

Method: Flash-ABFT computes an online checksum spanning the entire three-matrix product and softmax operation within the attention layer, requiring only a single check.

Result: Experimental outcomes indicate Flash-ABFT achieves high fault-detection accuracy with just 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9% energy consumption.

Conclusion: Flash-ABFT is presented as a cost-effective and robust improvement addressing error detection challenges in attention accelerators.

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes
Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire
three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer,
including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach
significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while
maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9%
energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error
detection in attention accelerators.

TL;DR: The paper extends a machine learning framework for CW complexes by leveraging optimal transport tools and deriving useful kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of machine learning methods tailored for effectively learning and representing CW complexes, despite their potential.

Method: The authors derive the Wasserstein distance using the Hodge-Laplacian matrix, extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to include structural and feature information, and introduce new kernels for probability measures on CW complexes.

Result: The study provides a meaningful way to compare and map CW complexes, along with novel representational tools for their probabilistic analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches advance the ability to perform machine learning on CW complexes, addressing structural and feature-integrative metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning
representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods
suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit
expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal
distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a
structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal
transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and
structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW
complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

### [198] [Towards Reliable, Uncertainty-Aware Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15906)
*Debangshu Banerjee,Kintan Saha,Aditya Gopalan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses instability in aligning large language models (LLMs) using reward models, proposing a variance-aware policy optimization approach to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment strategies rely on single reward models, which can be inaccurate and lead to inconsistent performance. This motivates the need for more stable alignment methods.

Method: The authors introduce a variance-aware policy optimization framework, featuring a policy regularizer informed by reward model variance estimates.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves stability and robustness in LLM alignment, as confirmed by experiments across diverse configurations.

Conclusion: Incorporating reward model variance into policy optimization reduces risks and ensures more reliable alignment of large language models.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

*Alberto Messina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that combines a flipped version of the Turing Test, a formal adversarial classification game, and reinforcement learning (RL) principles to optimize AI alignment and undetectability detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for refined AI evaluation and alignment methods, introducing a flipped Turing Test approach to identify machines and using quality constraints for better adversarial training.

Method: The framework involves casting a dual Turing Test as a two-player zero-sum game, using quality function metrics, phased tests, and a minimax strategy in iterative adversarial training. This is integrated with a reinforcement learning loop featuring rewards for fluency and penalties for stealthy outputs.

Result: The study introduces a structured approach to evaluate AI capabilities and optimize its alignment via specified quality thresholds and adversarial classifiers, providing a robust method for ongoing machine evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a novel model for AI evaluation, bridging theoretical and practical tools such as RL alignment pipelines, offering clear directions on combining quality and detection metrics in alignment strategies.

Abstract: In this short note, we propose a unified framework that bridges three areas:
(1) a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, the "dual Turing test", in which
a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

### [200] [HyDRA: A Hybrid-Driven Reasoning Architecture for Verifiable Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15917)
*Adrian Kaiser,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei,Ryan Gold,Marius-Constantin Dinu,Markus Hofmarcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyDRA, a hybrid architecture combining neurosymbolic methods and verifiable contracts for automating reliable and consistent Knowledge Graph (KG) construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automating KG construction, such as inconsistency, reliability issues, and lack of verifiability, which hinder progress in neurosymbolic AI.

Method: HyDRA employs neurosymbolic agents to collaboratively generate ontologies and competency questions, guiding KG construction. It uses verifiable contracts inspired by design-by-contract principles to control and verify KG generation through Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: HyDRA improves the functional correctness and reliability of automated KGs and introduces an evaluation framework for symbolic verification of the output.

Conclusion: The hybrid-driven architecture enhances the integrity and reliability of automated KG construction, with publicly available code to foster reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications
as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This

### [201] [On the transferability of Sparse Autoencoders for interpreting compressed models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15977)
*Suchit Gupte,Vishnu Kabir Chhabra,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the effect of compression methods on model interpretability using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), showing that SAEs trained on original models can still interpret compressed versions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how compression methods like pruning and quantization impact the interpretability of large language models, an area that remains unclear despite many existing compression techniques.

Method: The study utilizes Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to interpret models' activation spaces and compares the interpretability performance between original and compressed models.

Result: SAEs trained on the original model can interpret compressed models with slight degradation, while pruning the original SAE achieves similar results to training a new SAE on the compressed model.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that compression does not severely hinder interpretability, and leveraging pruned original SAEs can reduce training costs.

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of
SAEs.

### [202] [A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771)
*Michael Grosskopf,Kellin Rumsey,Ayan Biswas,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method is proposed to address the issue of discontinuous predictions arising from parallel sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) models in exascale computation, by enabling decentralized communication between neighboring partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supercomputers at exascale levels generate massive data, but users cannot rely on saving and accessing all data for post-analysis due to memory and scale constraints. Machine learning models that operate in situ, are scalable, memory-efficient, and handle partitioned spatial data are urgently required.

Method: The paper introduces the Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach, an extension of the SVGP technique, which allows limited communication between neighboring spatial partitions to improve consistency and reduce discontinuities in predictions.

Result: PSVGP achieves smoother spatial predictions and improved model performance compared to standard independent SVGP approaches. It remains computationally efficient and scalable with negligible added overhead.

Conclusion: PSVGP improves the alignment of local models across partitions, resulting in better spatial prediction accuracy while maintaining scalability and memory efficiency, making it suitable for applications like the E3SM on exascale supercomputers.

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of
exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible
than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely
on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical
analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning
algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting
must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is
distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable
approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model
independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is
scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect
of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between
neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea
by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial
partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to
smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our
decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly
scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in
terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the
independent SVGP case.

### [203] [Semantic-Aware Gaussian Process Calibration with Structured Layerwise Kernels for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15987)
*Kyung-hwan Lee,Kyung-tae Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAL-GP, a framework for improving confidence calibration in neural networks by employing a layer-wise Gaussian Process model aligned with the network architecture, enhancing predictive reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods struggle to accurately assess the predictive reliability of deep neural networks due to their inability to capture the hierarchical structure of these networks.

Method: The proposed SAL-GP framework utilizes a multi-layer Gaussian Process model, where each layer corresponds to the target neural network's architecture. This setup employs a structured multi-layer kernel for joint marginalization, allowing local and global calibration coherence.

Result: SAL-GP captures both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence effectively, propagating predictive uncertainty through the network.

Conclusion: The framework improves interpretability aligned with the neural network architecture and enhances the reliability and uncertainty quantification of predictions in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

*Yuzhi Liu,Zixuan Chen,Zirui Zhang,Yufei Liu,Giulia Lanzillotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) dynamics in continual learning settings where data distributions shift over time, providing a critique of limiting analyses to static kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine NTK dynamics beyond single-task learning scenarios and assess its relevance and limitations in continual learning settings.

Method: The study employs empirical analyses of NTK dynamics under shifted data distributions in continual learning, contrasting static-kernel assumptions.

Result: The findings reveal that continual learning provides valuable insights into NTK dynamics and exposes flaws in static-kernel approximations, even for large-scale data.

Conclusion: Continual learning offers an excellent testbed for studying NTK dynamics, suggesting static kernel assumptions may be inadequate for theoretical treatments in such scenarios.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

### [207] [A Lower Bound for the Number of Linear Regions of Ternary ReLU Regression Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16079)
*Yuta Nakahara,Manabu Kobayashi,Toshiyasu Matsushima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the expressivity of ternary neural networks (NNs) and shows their theoretical capability in terms of linear regions compared to standard neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing computational complexity and memory consumption in deep learning by better understanding ternary neural networks.

Method: The study analyzes the number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with ReLU activation, comparing width and depth performance metrics with standard NNs.

Result: It is shown that the number of linear regions in ternary NNs grows polynomially with width and exponentially with depth. Ternary NNs can match the linear region capabilities of standard NNs by either squaring their width or doubling their depth.

Conclusion: The theoretical findings explain the practical success of ternary NNs and highlight their potential in balancing efficiency and expressivity in neural network design.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework to predict Alzheimer's disease progression using personalized models and multimodal data, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individualized predictive models for Alzheimer's disease progression remain limited, prompting a need for accurate forecasting of patient trajectories.

Method: They developed a machine learning-based operator learning framework that uses Laplacian eigenfunction bases to create geometry-aware neural operators for capturing brain dynamics.

Result: The method achieved prediction accuracy exceeding 90% across multiple biomarkers and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable platform for precision modeling and therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative
disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response.
Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately
forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we
present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized
modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging,
biomarker, and clinical data. Unlike conventional models with prespecified
dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators
governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration
biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware
neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a
digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions,
simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied
to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90%
across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches.
This work offers a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and
personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.

*Yang Yu,Kai Han,Hang Zhou,Yehui Tang,Kaiqi Huang,Yunhe Wang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Data Weighting Model (DWM) to dynamically adjust the importance of data batches during LLM training, boosting training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent efforts in training LLMs aim to reduce computational costs and improve efficiency by strategically selecting high-quality training data, yet current methods mostly use static data criteria without accounting for dynamic interactions during training.

Method: The proposed DWM employs a bi-level optimization framework to adaptively update the weight of data within each training batch based on the model's evolving data preference.

Result: DWM improves the performance of models trained with random data selection, can be transferred to other selection methods, and works across models of different sizes.

Conclusion: DWM enhances training efficiency by dynamically optimizing the importance of data based on model preferences, offering new insights into data utilization during LLM training.

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model
(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a
dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach, Expert-guided Bag Reward Transformer (EBaReT), for improving automated bidding by addressing data quality and reward uncertainty issues. Extensive experiments show that it outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automated bidding, particularly data quality issues from sub-optimal bids and uncertainty in rewards due to low click and conversion rates.

Method: The proposed EBaReT generates expert trajectories for supplementary training data, uses Positive-Unlabeled learning to identify expert transitions, employs a novel expert-guided inference strategy, and designs a bag-based reward function to smooth reward acquisition.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that EBaReT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the automated bidding domain.

Conclusion: The study highlights EBaReT's effectiveness in improving automated bidding performance by leveraging expert-guided strategies and enhanced reward modeling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

TL;DR: METER introduces a unified benchmark for multi-modal interpretable forgery detection, targeting generative AI-based misinformation in images, videos, and audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI's ability to produce realistic synthetic content presents risks of misinformation, while current detection approaches lack interpretability and cross-modal insights.

Method: METER provides a dataset with forgery classification and evidence-based explanations, enriched by interpretability metrics, alongside a three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training approach.

Result: METER covers multiple media modalities and benchmarks interpretability using innovative metrics, proving effective in conveying forgery explanations.

Conclusion: METER establishes a robust benchmark, encouraging advancements in forgery detection and interpretability across diverse media formats.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMPTCR, a molecular surface representation designed for efficient and effective molecular property prediction, achieving strong performance on tasks like bacterial growth inhibition and molecular weight prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing molecular representations, such as SMILES strings and 3D graphs, that fail to fully capture surface-local phenomena relevant to intermolecular behavior. It also aims to tackle the computational inefficiency of SE(3)-equivariant models required for spatial variance handling.

Method: The authors developed AMPTCR, an aligned point cloud representation combining local quantum-derived scalar fields, geodesically-derived topology vectors, and canonical reference frame coordinates. This allows the use of standard SE(3)-sensitive architectures for efficient learning.

Result: The AMPTCR model showed strong performance in predicting molecular weight with a validation R^2 of 0.87. For bacterial growth inhibition tasks, it achieved an ROC AUC of 0.912 in classification and an R^2 of 0.54 in regression when integrated with Dual Fukui functions and auxiliary data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that AMPTCR is a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation tailored for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties, demonstrating its potential in various molecular prediction tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on
representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook
the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize DNN hardware mapping, achieving significant improvements in latency and energy efficiency compared to standard single-agent RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing DNN hardware mapping is crucial for improving latency, energy usage, and resource utilization in accelerator design, but existing RL methods suffer from sample inefficiency.

Method: A decentralized MARL framework is proposed where multiple agents explore the mapping space. An agent clustering algorithm based on correlation analysis groups agents with similar mapping parameters to enhance learning efficiency.

Result: The MARL framework achieves 30-300x improvement in sample efficiency over single-agent RL, with up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product reduction.

Conclusion: The decentralized MARL framework demonstrates significant benefits in DNN hardware mapping by enhancing sample efficiency and improving performance metrics, offering a promising direction for accelerator design optimization.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the interplay between model capacity, sparsity, and robustness in low-capacity neural networks using binary classification tasks derived from MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand foundational trade-offs in neural networks related to capacity, sparsity, and robustness, which are often overshadowed in studies focusing on over-parameterized models.

Method: A controlled framework was built using binary classification tasks of varying difficulty derived from the MNIST dataset. The study evaluated model generalization capacity, pruning effects, and robustness to input corruption.

Result: Key findings showed that minimum model capacity directly scales with task complexity, networks maintain robustness under extreme sparsity (95% pruning), and over-parameterization increases input corruption robustness. Sparse subnetworks retain reasoning processes similar to dense models.

Conclusion: The study empirically demonstrates core trade-offs and behaviors in low-capacity neural networks, highlighting sparsity and over-parameterization benefits for robustness and task adaptability.

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResAlign, a framework to make text-to-image diffusion models resilient against unsafe behaviors post fine-tuning, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often retain unsafe behaviors from their pretraining data, raising safety concerns, especially when fine-tuned for personalized applications.

Method: ResAlign employs Moreau Envelope-based reformulation for efficient gradient estimation to suppress harmful behaviors and uses a meta-learning strategy to simulate diverse fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: ResAlign significantly outperforms existing unlearning approaches in maintaining safety post fine-tuning across various datasets, fine-tuning techniques, and configurations.

Conclusion: ResAlign ensures enhanced safety retention and benign image generation, addressing fragility issues in prior unlearning methods under fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

*Xin-De Wang,Zhi-Rui Chen,Peng-Jie Guo,Ze-Feng Gao,Cheng Mu,Zhong-Yi Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perovskite-R1, a large language model tailored for discovering and designing precursor additives for perovskite solar cells, addressing challenges in stability, scalability, and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in commercializing perovskite solar cells, such as stability, sustainability, and manufacturing scalability, by leveraging domain-specific data for precursor additive improvements.

Method: The authors created Perovskite-R1 by fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on a curated dataset of 1,232 publications and 33,269 materials using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Perovskite-R1 intelligently synthesizes literature insights and proposes strategies that experimentally validate improvements in material stability and performance for perovskite solar cells.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of specialized language models in advancing materials discovery and provides a framework for closed-loop, data-driven research in photovoltaics.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

### [218] [The Cost of Compression: Tight Quadratic Black-Box Attacks on Sketches for $\ell_2$ Norm Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16345)
*Sara Ahmadian,Edith Cohen,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates adversarial attacks against dimensionality reduction methods based on linear sketching, demonstrating vulnerabilities regardless of the sketch matrix or query method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address vulnerabilities of dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly in adversarial contexts where approximations of norms could fail through deliberate attack.

Method: The authors study black-box adversarial attacks and present a universal, nonadaptive method that exploits queries to the sketching system, bypassing matrix specifics and estimator details.

Result: The proposed attack causes failures in norm estimation or creates adversarial inputs, matching lower bounds tightly with existing methods designed for specific sketch types.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the inherent vulnerabilities of linear sketching techniques to adversarial attacks and draws parallels with issues seen in image classification, emphasizing the risks in compressed data representations.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

### [219] [Leveraging Personalized PageRank and Higher-Order Topological Structures for Heterophily Mitigation in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16347)
*Yumeng Wang,Zengyi Wo,Wenjun Wang,Xingcheng Fu,Minglai Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HPGNN, a model combining Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks to better handle heterophilic graphs, improving performance while balancing scalability and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address performance issues in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on heterophilic graphs due to limited modeling of multi-scale information and interference from conflicting class labels.

Method: The authors propose HPGNN, which integrates higher-order approximations of Personalized PageRank into GNNs to embed long-range, multi-scale interactions into graph convolutional networks, while reducing noise and computational complexity.

Result: HPGNN outperformed five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs and maintained competitive results on homophilic graphs in benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: HPGNN effectively balances robustness to noise, multi-scale information modeling, and computational efficiency, making it a strong candidate for real-world graph learning tasks involving diverse graph structures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

### [220] [Bipartite Patient-Modality Graph Learning with Event-Conditional Modelling of Censoring for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16363)
*Hailin Yue,Hulin Kuang,Jin Liu,Junjian Li,Lanlan Wang,Mengshen He,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CenSurv, a graph-based model leveraging censored and uncensored data for cancer survival prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robustness in scenarios with missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the prediction of cancer patient survival by addressing limitations in prior models that neglect censored data and perform poorly in scenarios with missing modality.

Method: The approach involves three key components: a graph-based structure for multimodal data representation, a bipartite graph with modality alignment for missing scenarios, and an event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) for handling censored data.

Result: CenSurv achieved superior performance, improving mean C-index by 3.1% over state-of-the-art models and enhancing robustness in modality-missing scenarios. Additionally, ECMC increased the mean C-index of 8 baselines by 1.3% across 5 datasets.

Conclusion: CenSurv effectively models multimodal data and leverages censored samples to improve cancer survival predictions, offering significant advances in accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

*Zhihan Zeng,Yiqi Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), focusing on scenarios that avoid over-parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous research that relied on over-parameterization in PINNs, which can lead to excessive computational costs and impracticality in real-world applications.

Method: The authors analyze optimization and generalization of SGD for training two-layer PINNs under certain assumptions about the target function, avoiding the need for over-parameterization.

Result: It is shown that if the network width meets a threshold based on the problem and a predefined accuracy, both the training and expected losses can be reduced to $O(\epsilon)$.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical framework for training PINNs using SGD without heavily relying on over-parameterization, thereby making the approach more computationally feasible.

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

### [222] [Improving Predictions on Highly Unbalanced Data Using Open Source Synthetic Data Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16419)
*Ivona Krchova,Michael Platzer,Paul Tiwald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates the application of synthetic data in addressing unbalanced tabular datasets, highlighting its advantage in improving minority class prediction accuracy compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle pervasive issues in predictive modeling involving unbalanced datasets, where minority classes struggle to be accurately represented due to their under-representation.

Method: The authors benchmark synthetic upsampling using an open-source Synthetic Data SDK by MOSTLY AI, comparing it to traditional approaches like naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC on various datasets.

Result: Findings show that synthetic data improves predictive accuracy for minority classes, especially for mixed-type datasets, by generating diverse data points to address sparse feature spaces.

Conclusion: Synthetic data is a promising solution for enhancing predictive models in unbalanced datasets, enabling superior performance for minority class predictions.

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

*Tomás Hüttebräucker,Mario Edoardo Pandolfo,Simone Fiorellino,Emilio Calvanese Strinati,Paolo Di Lorenzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces joint physical and semantic channel equalization for MIMO systems using RIS, addressing semantic mismatches among independently trained AI devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome semantic mismatches in multi-user MIMO systems, which impede mutual understanding in semantic communication systems relying on DNNs.

Method: Proposes semantic equalization with transformations at transmitter, RIS-aided channel, and receiver, using constrained MMSE optimization with linear and DNN-based solutions.

Result: The joint equalization methods outperform conventional disjoint approaches in various wireless channel conditions.

Conclusion: Combining physical and semantic channel equalization enhances communication efficiency in MIMO systems, especially when AI-native devices are present.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

*Isabella Degen,Zahraa S Abdallah,Kate Robson Brown,Henry W J Reeve*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for validating clusterings in correlation-based multivariate time series data using predefined canonical correlation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing validity indices for clustering are designed for Euclidean data and their suitability for correlation-based clustering has not been systematically assessed.

Method: Canonical correlation patterns are introduced as mathematically defined validation targets to discretize infinite correlation space into interpretable reference patterns.

Result: Experimental results using synthetic datasets show that these canonical patterns reliably validate clustering structures under controlled conditions, outperforming other metrics.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust methodology for validating correlation-based clustering, applicable across critical domains like health, finance, and industry.

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how humans use analogy as a key mechanism for creating and utilizing flexible internal models to navigate situations, proposing a framework based on modular reuse across structurally related domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding how humans construct internal models that are effective yet computationally tractable for navigating new environments.

Method: The authors formalize analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes and propose a framework leveraging abstract, reusable modules derived from past experiences.

Result: The framework suggests that using reusable abstract modules enables the flexible adaptation of planning and representation across domains sharing structural similarities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that analogy-driven modular construction of internal models can help navigate novel situations efficiently by borrowing and repurposing learned structures from past experiences.

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be
useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment
that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must
be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a
central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library for simplifying the development and benchmarking of gradient-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two primary challenges: the overreliance on the DARTS benchmark and fragmented implementations in gradient-based one-shot NAS research.

Method: The authors propose Confopt, a library providing a minimal API to integrate search spaces and decompose NAS optimizers into core components. They also establish novel DARTS-based benchmarks and a new evaluation protocol.

Result: Confopt streamlines NAS method development and unveils critical flaws in existing evaluation practices using their new benchmarks and protocol.

Conclusion: Confopt enhances reproducibility and facilitates further advancement in gradient-based one-shot NAS, while highlighting the need for improved evaluation standards.

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code can be

TL;DR: The paper introduces a symbolic method for graph classification using sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines, focusing on hierarchical semantics and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph classification methods are limited by lack of symbolic transparency and local interpretability. This research aims to design a framework that ensures competitive performance while preserving these attributes.

Method: The authors propose encoding graphs via structured message passing using sparse binary hypervectors. This approach binds and bundles node, edge, and attribute information hierarchically into discrete hypervector representations.

Result: Their method was tested on TUDataset benchmarks, showing competitive accuracy compared to neural graph models while keeping symbolic interpretability intact.

Conclusion: The framework delivers both strong symbolic transparency and competitive accuracy, making it a viable alternative to neural graph models for tasks requiring interpretability.

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is
encoded through structured message passing, where node, edge, and attribute
information are bound and bundled into a symbolic hypervector. This process
preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from
node attributes to edge relations to structural roles resulting in a compact,
discrete representation. We also formulate a local interpretability framework
which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating
competitive accuracy with strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph
models.

TL;DR: The survey introduces a two-level data-centric taxonomy for Federated Graph Learning (FGL) research, focusing on data characteristics and utilization, to address constraints in enhancing performance. It also discusses integration with pretrained models and future trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has potential benefits for balancing data optimization and privacy but lacks a systematic study through a data-centric perspective.

Method: The authors propose a novel two-level taxonomy categorizing FGL studies: one based on data characteristics, and another based on data utilization techniques.

Result: The taxonomy provides a structured approach to assess FGL studies, highlighting integration with pretrained models, real-world applications, and future directions.

Conclusion: FGL research reorganized under the proposed taxonomy improves understanding of data-centric challenges, paving the way for more efficient and realistic applications.

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has
emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing
the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and
preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have
contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning
(FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that
emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric
perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data
properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is
critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to
enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric
taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the
structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data
Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to
overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three
orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration.
Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large
Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction
aligned with emerging trends in GML.

*Yuqi Pan,Yongqi An,Zheng Li,Yuhong Chou,Ruijie Zhu,Xiaohui Wang,Mingxuan Wang,Jinqiao Wang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sparse State Expansion (SSE), a novel method for improving the efficiency and performance of long-context scenarios in Transformer-like architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face computational and memory challenges in handling long contexts, and existing linear attention methods compromise performance in retrieval and reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a row-sparse update mechanism with sparse classification and introduce Sparse State Expansion, which decouples parameter size from state capacity using a partitioned sparse framework.

Result: Experiments show SSE achieves strong retrieval performance and state-of-the-art small-model mathematical reasoning scores after reinforcement learning. It performs well across several benchmarks and scales with state size.

Conclusion: SSE provides an efficient and scalable solution for long-context modeling, with significant improvements in retrieval and reasoning tasks compared to traditional and linear attention Transformers.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

*Yushang Zhao,Huijie Shen,Dannier Li,Lu Chang,Chengrui Zhou,Yinuo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a meta-learning framework for parameter-efficient prompt-tuning in LLM-based recommender systems, addressing cold-start scenarios efficiently and outperforming strong baselines while enabling real-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems struggle with cold-start scenarios and rely on dense-user-item-focused approaches that are costly to update and maintain.

Method: The framework utilizes meta-learning to optimize learnable soft prompt embeddings using Reptile and MAML techniques, treating each user as a task for episodic sampling and generalization.

Result: The model surpasses baselines in metrics like NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR across datasets like MovieLens-1M and Amazon Reviews. It adapts in real-time (below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, real-time zero-history personalization and strengthens financial system stability by reducing latency in systemic vulnerability detection.

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to address semantic mismatches and channel impairments in communication using learned MIMO precoder/decoder solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic mismatches that arise during communication between devices with different languages, logics, or internal representations.

Method: It introduces two methods for mitigating issues: a linear method optimized using ADMM and a neural network model under specific constraints.

Result: The numerical results show improved effectiveness for goal-oriented semantic communication, balancing accuracy, burden, and complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions significantly enhance semantic communication by reducing mismatches and channel issues, offering practical trade-offs.

Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the
meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks
that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on
different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches
may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a
novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic
communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair
that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel
equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel
impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving
a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic
MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity
constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the
main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the
solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FISHER is a foundation model designed to analyze multi-modal industrial signals effectively. It addresses challenges with signal heterogeneity through a unified representation approach, showcasing improved general performance and efficient scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The industry faces challenges in analyzing heterogenous industrial signals and detecting abnormalities effectively, as traditional methods fail to utilize synergies between modalities.

Method: FISHER uses STFT sub-band units and employs a teacher-student self-supervised learning framework for pre-training, enabling adaptability to varying sampling rates.

Result: FISHER outperforms top SSL models with a performance gain of up to 5.03% on the RMIS benchmark and showcases efficient scaling curves for representing multi-modal industrial signals.

Conclusion: FISHER demonstrates versatile capabilities and provides insights into future research directions. It sets a new benchmark for industrial signal analysis and is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

*Viktor Muryn,Marta Sumyk,Mariya Hirna,Sofiya Garkot,Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Screen2AX, a framework for creating hierarchical accessibility metadata for desktop interfaces using screenshots, improving accessibility and autonomous agent interaction with complex interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete or missing accessibility metadata in desktop applications has led to significant barriers for users needing assistive tools like screen readers and for AI agents to understand application screens.

Method: The authors developed Screen2AX, leveraging vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and hierarchically organize UI elements from screenshots. Additionally, they compiled datasets for macOS applications annotated for accessibility metadata.

Result: Screen2AX achieves a 77% F1 score in reconstructing accessibility trees and greatly improves autonomous agent performance in task execution, outperforming native accessibility features and state-of-the-art models like OmniParser V2.

Conclusion: Screen2AX bridges the gap in accessibility metadata generation for desktop applications, enhancing application interpretability and usability for both assistive tools and autonomous agents, and sets a new benchmark for evaluating agent task execution.

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

*Morad Tukan,Loay Mualem,Eitan Netzer,Liran Sigalat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve coreset-based data reduction for optimized classification performance, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key classification metrics like F1 score are often overlooked in traditional coreset methods focusing on loss approximation. This research aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors developed tunable parameters including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation, and active sampling refinement for more effective coreset generation.

Result: The tuned coresets improved classification performance significantly compared to both traditional coresets and training on the full dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a systematic way to enhance training efficiency by optimizing coresets for better classification metrics.

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

### [235] [Steering Out-of-Distribution Generalization with Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16795)
*Helena Casademunt,Caden Juang,Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a method to control unintended generalizations in fine-tuned large language models without altering training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of unintended out-of-distribution generalization during fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), which is difficult to correct solely by modifying training datasets.

Method: CAFT uses interpretability tools to identify undesired concepts in the model's latent space and eliminates their influence through linear projections during fine-tuning.

Result: By applying CAFT to three tasks, the method significantly reduces emergent misalignment, achieving a 10x decrease in misaligned responses, without negatively affecting in-distribution performance.

Conclusion: CAFT offers a practical and innovative approach to steering LLM generalization, circumventing the need for changes to training datasets and effectively improving the alignment of fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

*Mehul Damani,Isha Puri,Stewart Slocum,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Yoon Kim,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLCR, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances language model calibration and accuracy during reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unintended side effects of binary reward functions, such as degraded calibration and increased hallucinations in reasoning models.

Method: RLCR optimizes a reward function combining correctness scores and the Brier score for calibrated confidence estimation.

Result: RLCR improves calibration without sacrificing accuracy across various datasets, outperforming traditional RL and post-hoc confidence classifiers.

Conclusion: Explicitly training models for calibration produces reasoning models that are more reliable and effective for both in-domain and out-of-domain applications.

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

### [237] [Semi-off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Slow-thinking Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16814)
*Junhao Shen,Haiteng Zhao,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Haian Huang,Jianfei Gao,Dahua Lin,Wenwei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOPHIA, a semi-off-policy reinforcement learning method for enhancing slow-thinking reasoning abilities in large vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving complex reasoning capabilities in large vision-language models, which struggle with on-policy RL due to limited initial abilities and risk visual hallucination in off-policy RL.

Method: SOPHIA develops a semi-off-policy RL approach by combining on-policy visual understanding and off-policy slow-thinking reasoning. It employs outcome-based and visual rewards, and trains with propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms.

Result: SOPHIA significantly boosts the performance of large vision-language models (e.g., an 8.50% improvement for InternVL3.0-38B), achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal reasoning benchmarks and surpassing some closed-source models like GPT-4.1 on select tasks.

Conclusion: SOPHIA demonstrates an effective way to combine on-policy and off-policy RL techniques for slow-thinking reasoning in vision-language models, offering improved accuracy and potential foundations for further training.

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.

### [238] [Beyond Rate Coding: Surrogate Gradients Enable Spike Timing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16043)
*Ziqiao Yu,Pengfei Sun,Dan F. M. Goodman*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper examines how Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD) can learn from spike timing rather than just firing rates, demonstrating their abilities in synthetic tasks, speech-based datasets, and robustness to temporal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether Spiking Neural Networks can effectively learn temporal coding from precise spike timings, beyond simple rate-based coding, and evaluate their robustness to biologically inspired perturbations.

Method: The authors design synthetic tasks and modified speech recognition datasets that isolate spike timing information. They train SNNs using Surrogate GD, evaluate their ability to perform tasks relying on timing-based information, and test robustness under various temporal perturbations.

Result: SNNs trained with Surrogate GD outperformed rate-based models on timing-dependent tasks and demonstrated specific degradation under biologically inspired perturbations. Networks trained with delay learning showed more sensitivity to reversed spike sequences, resembling human-like processing.

Conclusion: SNNs trained with Surrogate GD can learn from and leverage spike timing information, showing promise for temporal coding tasks and robustness under perturbations. This work advances the understanding of SNNs' capabilities and provides modified datasets for further research.

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained
with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay
learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first
design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and
cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based
speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech
Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is
eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate
GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely
rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under
biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or
per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but
perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when
spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from
SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in
terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have
released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance compiler optimization by integrating runtime behavior analysis and addressing existing challenges in PGO effectiveness and portability.

Method: A systematic categorization and performance evaluation of PGO approaches, profiling methods, optimization timings, integration with compilers, and target architectures.

Result: The survey highlights key PGO algorithms and frameworks, evaluates their speedups and overheads, and identifies open challenges such as sampling overhead and dynamic input workloads.

Conclusion: Current PGO techniques are beneficial but face challenges in achieving low-overhead profiling and supporting dynamic and diverse workloads, with potential for future advancements in optimization and cross-architecture compatibility.

Abstract: Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) uses runtime profiling to direct compiler
optimization decisions, effectively combining static analysis with actual
execution behavior to enhance performance. Runtime profiles, collected through
instrumentation or hardware- and software-assisted sampling, provide detailed
insights into control flow, branch predictions, and memory access patterns.
This survey systematically categorizes PGO research by profiling method
(instrumentation vs. sampling), optimizations (compile time and link/post-link
time), compiler integration (GCC, LLVM), and target architectures. Key
algorithms and frameworks are shown in terms of design principles. Performance
evaluation on representative examples demonstrates PGO's speedups, overheads,
and integration maturity. Finally, we identify open challenges, such as
reducing sampling overhead, dynamic input workloads, and supporting
cross-architecture portability, and propose future research directions to
low-overhead profiling and advanced compilers.

*Juan Altmayer Pizzorno,Emery D. Berger*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RightTyper, a tool for automatically generating Python type annotations with reduced performance overhead and enhanced type precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually annotating types in Python is tedious, and current automated methods have drawbacks like runtime overhead or incorrect inference.

Method: RightTyper uses sampling guided by self-profiling, statistical filtering, and aggregation to generate precise type annotations efficiently.

Result: RightTyper imposes only a 30% runtime overhead on average, improves recall in type-checking, and helps identify corner cases for anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RightTyper provides a practical and efficient solution to the challenges of type annotation in Python, enhancing precision and utility compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Python type annotations bring the benefits of static type checking to the
language. However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and
tedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely
untyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a
number of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer
overly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare
or user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,
degrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,
and even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all
prior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.
This assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that
have been untyped.
  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes
these disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations
based on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to
prior approaches. It also turns type checking into anomaly detection, allowing
the type checker to identify corner cases that the programmer can audit for
unintended behavior. RightTyper is also fast and space-efficient, imposing just
30% performance overhead on average. RightTyper achieves these characteristics
by a principled yet pervasive use of sampling--guided by self-profiling--along
with statistical filtering and careful resolution and aggregation of type
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the semantic framework for Haskell-style overloading, providing a more expressive and robust solution for Haskell's type class systems without relying on additional type equality axioms.

Method: They created System Fₓ, a new core language characterized by open data types and open functions, and mechanized its metatheory using the Lean4 theorem prover.

Result: System Fₓ successfully encodes advanced features of Haskell's type class system more expressively compared to existing semantics and does so without requiring extra type equality axioms.

Conclusion: System Fₓ offers a more expressive and alternative framework for representing Haskell-style overloading while ensuring formal correctness via mechanization in Lean4.

Abstract: We present a new, uniform semantics for Haskell-style overloading. We realize
our approach in a new core language, System F$_\mathrm{D}$, whose metatheory we
mechanize in the Lean4 interactive theorem prover. System F$_\mathrm{D}$ is
distinguished by its open data types and open functions, each given by a
collection of instances rather than by a single definition. We show that System
F$_\mathrm{D}$ can encode advanced features of Haskell's of type class systems,
more expressively than current semantics of these features, and without
assuming additional type equality axioms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the graph-relational database model to address the mismatch between relational databases and nested application data, and implements it with EdgeQL and Gel for efficient data manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational databases use flat representations, which conflict with the deeply nested data structures used in many applications, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: A new graph-relational database model is proposed, defined formally, and implemented using EdgeQL as a query language and the Gel system for compiling queries into efficient PostgreSQL queries.

Result: The graph-relational model and its implementation in EdgeQL and Gel enable more efficient, object-shaped data manipulation compared to traditional ORMs or raw SQL.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-relational model can bridge the object-relational gap effectively, combining efficiency with flexibility in handling nested data structures.

Abstract: For applications that store structured data in relational databases, there is
an impedance mismatch between the flat representations encouraged by relational
data models and the deeply nested information that applications expect to
receive. In this work, we present the graph-relational database model, which
provides a flexible, compositional, and strongly-typed solution to this
"object-relational mismatch." We formally define the graph-relational database
model and present a static and dynamic semantics for queries. In addition, we
discuss the realization of the graph-relational database model in EdgeQL, a
general-purpose SQL-style query language, and the Gel system, which compiles
EdgeQL schemas and queries into PostgreSQL queries. Gel facilitates the kind of
object-shaped data manipulation that is frequently provided inefficiently by
object-relational mapping (ORM) technologies, while achieving most of the
efficiency that comes from require writing complex PostgreSQL queries directly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current compiler optimizations, particularly high computational costs and neglect of Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) sparsity.

Method: Proposes the SPL (Series-Parallel-Loop) decomposition framework and applies it to three optimization problems: register allocation, LOSPRE, and bank selection, leveraging PCSPs (Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems) in graph structures.

Result: The SPL decomposition method demonstrates significant performance improvements in benchmarks across register allocation, LOSPRE, and bank selection tasks through experiments.

Conclusion: The SPL decomposition is an effective and powerful method for optimizing complex compiler processes, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches with superior performance.

Abstract: This thesis addresses the complexities of compiler optimizations, such as
register allocation and Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy
Elimination (LOSPRE), which are often handled using tree decomposition
algorithms. However, these methods frequently overlook important sparsity
aspects of Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and result in high computational costs.
We introduce the SPL (Series-Parallel-Loop) decomposition, a novel framework
that offers optimal solutions to these challenges. A key contribution is the
formulation of a general solution for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(PCSPs) within graph structures, applied to three optimization problems. First,
SPL decomposition enhances register allocation by accurately modeling variable
interference graphs, leading to efficient register assignments and improved
performance across benchmarks. Second, it optimizes LOSPRE by effectively
identifying and eliminating redundancies in program execution. Finally, the
thesis focuses on optimizing the placement of bank selection instructions to
enhance data retrieval efficiency and reduce latency. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods,
establishing SPL decomposition as a powerful tool for complex compiler

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flax, a framework combining learning-based entity importance prediction with symbolic task expansion to improve task planning in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task planners face challenges like combinatorial explosion due to complex relationships among entities. Simple neuro-symbolic integrations often miss critical entities, creating unsolvable tasks.

Method: Flax uses a graph neural network to predict entity importance, solves simplified tasks symbolically, iteratively integrates missed entities from rough plans, and refines tasks through complementary symbolic rules.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show a 20.82% success rate improvement and a 17.65% reduction in planning time compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Flax enables fast, scalable, and reliable long-horizon task planning, addressing critical limitations of previous neuro-symbolic approaches in complex environments.

Abstract: Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of
entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial
explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent
methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few
"important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting
resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning,
we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance
prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural
network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it
with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick
rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to
recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary
rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact.
Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze
navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact
with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success
rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with
the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path
toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the proliferation of techniques for state estimation using LiDAR sensors, there is a need for systematic ablation studies to understand the impact of individual components in an LO pipeline, which prior works lack.

Method: The authors summarize techniques used in LO pipelines and conduct extensive empirical evaluations of pipeline components across different datasets, environments, LiDAR types, and vehicle motions.

Result: The empirical evaluations reveal insights about the performance of various LO pipeline components, leading to informed recommendations for enhancing accuracy and reliability in future designs.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical components of LO pipelines, providing empirically-backed guidelines for designing more accurate and robust LiDAR Odometry systems.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become the sensor of choice
for many robotic state estimation tasks. Because of this, in recent years there
has been significant work done to fine the most accurate method to perform
state estimation using these sensors. In each of these prior works, an
explosion of possible technique combinations has occurred, with each work
comparing LiDAR Odometry (LO) "pipelines" to prior "pipelines". Unfortunately,
little work up to this point has performed the significant amount of ablation
studies comparing the various building-blocks of a LO pipeline. In this work,
we summarize the various techniques that go into defining a LO pipeline and
empirically evaluate these LO components on an expansive number of datasets
across environments, LiDAR types, and vehicle motions. Finally, we make
empirically-backed recommendations for the design of future LO pipelines to
provide the most accurate and reliable performance.

*Xuying Huang,Sicong Pan,Olga Zatsarynna,Juergen Gall,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for privacy-preserving robot navigation by enabling semantic segmentation of ultra-low-resolution images to strike a balance between task performance and privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address privacy concerns in mobile robotics while maintaining effective robot navigation and task performance.

Method: The authors introduce a joint-learning approach combining an agglomerative feature extractor and a segmentation-aware discriminator for semantic segmentation of ultra-low-resolution images.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline models in ultra-low-resolution semantic segmentation and improves success rates for object-goal navigation in privacy-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of privacy-preserving robotic navigation using ultra-low-resolution image segmentation, achieving both improved privacy and navigation success rates.

Abstract: User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing
methods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks
or privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of
task execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based
robot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.
A key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from
ultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully
joint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a
segmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic
segmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal
navigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution
semantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the
success rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world
privacy-constrained scenario.

*Emek Barış Küçüktabak,Matthew R. Short,Lorenzo Vianello,Daniel Ludvig,Levi Hargrove,Kevin Lynch,Jose Pons*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel therapy method for stroke patients using robotic exoskeletons, enabling better rehabilitation outcomes by combining robotic precision with therapist intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke patients often face mobility and balance impairments, and traditional therapist-led rehabilitation methods are physically demanding and limited in scope. Robotic exoskeletons aim to address these limitations but fail to optimally integrate therapist adaptability.

Method: This study proposes physical Human-Robot-Human Interaction (pHRHI), where both the therapist and stroke patient wear connected robotic exoskeletons at the hips and knees to enable guided and haptic movement training.

Result: In tests with eight stroke patients, the pHRHI approach showed improved joint range of motion, step metrics, muscle activation, and motivation over conventional treadmill therapy.

Conclusion: pHRHI leverages robotic exoskeletons and therapist-guided interaction to enhance stroke rehabilitation outcomes, providing a promising combination of technology and human intuition.

Abstract: Following a stroke, individuals often experience mobility and balance
impairments due to lower-limb weakness and loss of independent joint control.
Gait recovery is a key goal of rehabilitation, traditionally achieved through
high-intensity therapist-led training. However, manual assistance can be
physically demanding and limits the therapist's ability to interact with
multiple joints simultaneously. Robotic exoskeletons offer multi-joint support,
reduce therapist strain, and provide objective feedback, but current control
strategies often limit therapist involvement and adaptability.
  We present a novel gait rehabilitation paradigm based on physical
Human-Robot-Human Interaction (pHRHI), where both the therapist and the
post-stroke individual wear lower-limb exoskeletons virtually connected at the
hips and knees via spring-damper elements. This enables bidirectional
interaction, allowing the therapist to guide movement and receive haptic
feedback. In a study with eight chronic stroke patients, pHRHI training
outperformed conventional therapist-guided treadmill walking, leading to
increased joint range of motion, step metrics, muscle activation, and
motivation. These results highlight pHRHI's potential to combine robotic
precision with therapist intuition for improved rehabilitation outcomes.

*Zhehui Huang,Guangyao Shi,Yuwei Wu,Vijay Kumar,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAN2CB, a framework that uses large language models to transform natural language mission descriptions into executable Python code for coordinating multi-robot systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-robot coordination is labor-intensive, requires expertise, and lacks flexibility, prompting the need for an automated, generalizable solution.

Method: LAN2CB features two components: Mission Decomposition parsing natural language into a task graph, and Code Generation leveraging the task graph and knowledge base to create executable code for robots.

Result: Experiments in simulations and real-world applications show LAN2CB effectively simplifies and generalizes robot coordination, reducing manual engineering and accommodating diverse mission types.

Conclusion: LAN2CB demonstrates the potential of using language models for flexible and automated multi-robot coordination, offering an accessible and scalable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a task-specific and
expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are
manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm
design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive,
inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements.
Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework
that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the
multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language
mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems
through two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation,
which parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code
Generation, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to
generate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of
natural language mission specifications to support development and
benchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings
show that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from
natural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while
supporting generalization across mission types. Website:

*Shanshan Zhang,Qi Zhang,Siyue Wang,Tianshui Wen,Ziheng Zhou,Lingxiang Zheng,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel network architecture integrating frequency-domain and time-domain learning to enhance inertial odometry accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inertial odometry using CNNs in the time domain struggle to capture long-term dependencies in IMU data, limiting localization accuracy.

Method: The proposed approach combines frequency-domain learning for long-term dependency modeling and redundancy reduction, with Scalar LSTM for capturing sequential dependencies in the time domain, enabling cross-domain fusion.

Result: Experiments on public datasets like RIDI and RoNIN show significant error reductions, with a 43.0% improvement in absolute trajectory error and 13.1% in relative trajectory error on RoNIN.

Conclusion: Integrating frequency-domain and time-domain information successfully boosts the localization accuracy, offering a robust solution for inertial odometry.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has achieved significant advancements in
inertial odometry. However, most existing inertial odometry methods primarily
rely on CNNs in the time domain. These methods often struggle to capture
long-term dependency in inertial measurement unit data, thereby constraining
the potential for further improvements in localization accuracy. To address
these issues, we propose a novel network architecture that integrates both
frequency-domain and time-domain information. Specifically, we leverage the
global view and energy compaction properties of frequency-domain learning to
effectively model long-term dependency and reduce redundancy in IMU data.
Additionally, we introduce a Scalar LSTM to capture sequential dependencies in
the time domain, enabling cross-domain information fusion and providing a
stable and reliable reference for localization. Experimental evaluations on
multiple public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, OxIOD, RNIN, TLIO, and IMUNet)
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-time domain fusion
strategy. Notably, on the RoNIN dataset, our method achieves a 43.0% reduction
in absolute trajectory error and a 13.1% reduction in relative trajectory error
compared to RoNIN ResNet.

*Shanshan Zhang,Qi Zhang,Siyue Wang,Tianshui Wen,Ziheng Zhou,Lingxiang Zheng,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight inertial odometry (IO) framework that addresses drift errors during complex motion patterns, significantly improving localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IO methods fail to sufficiently account for drift errors during complex motion patterns, limiting real-world applications.

Method: The authors employ the Star Operation method to project inertial data into a high-dimensional feature space, alongside collaborative attention mechanisms and Multi Scale Gated Convolution Units to model motion more effectively.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance, significantly reducing Absolute Trajectory Errors (ATE) by up to 65.78% compared to baseline models on the RoNIN dataset.

Conclusion: The framework improves the ability to model complex motion dynamics, providing a new benchmark in inertial odometry and enhancing practical usability for localization systems.

Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) directly estimates the position of a carrier from
inertial sensor measurements and serves as a core technology for the widespread
deployment of consumer grade localization systems. While existing IO methods
can accurately reconstruct simple and near linear motion trajectories, they
often fail to account for drift errors caused by complex motion patterns such
as turning. This limitation significantly degrades localization accuracy and
restricts the applicability of IO systems in real world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a lightweight IO framework. Specifically, inertial
data is projected into a high dimensional implicit nonlinear feature space
using the Star Operation method, enabling the extraction of complex motion
features that are typically overlooked. We further introduce a collaborative
attention mechanism that jointly models global motion dynamics across both
channel and temporal dimensions. In addition, we design Multi Scale Gated
Convolution Units to capture fine grained dynamic variations throughout the
motion process, thereby enhancing the model's ability to learn rich and
expressive motion representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA baselines across six widely used
inertial datasets. Compared to baseline models on the RoNIN dataset, it
achieves reductions in ATE ranging from 2.26% to 65.78%, thereby establishing a
new benchmark in the field.

*Dakota Sullivan,Shirley Zhang,Jennica Li,Heather Kirkorian,Bilge Mutlu,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study assesses the privacy sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) in the context of household social robots, revealing a low agreement between human preferences and LLM choices, and exploring ways to improve LLM privacy awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can handle sensitive personal information responsibly in household social robot contexts, given the rising tension between utility and privacy risks.

Method: The study involved crafting privacy-relevant scenarios using Contextual Integrity (CI), surveying 450 users on their privacy preferences in robot behaviors, and analyzing the responses of 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Four prompting strategies were tested to enhance LLM performance for privacy awareness.

Result: Findings show that current LLMs exhibit low alignment with human privacy preferences. Using additional prompting strategies slightly improved the consistency of LLMs as privacy controllers.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while LLMs hold potential in managing sensitive data responsibly in social robots, significant improvements are needed to bridge the gap between human expectations and LLM privacy-awareness capabilities.

Abstract: Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following
human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal
cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have
previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user
interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new
opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot
interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to
collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a
result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within
home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks,
evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we
aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the
context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of
privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity
(CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot
behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices
of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and
questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between
humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a
potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies
and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential
of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve sample efficiency and spatial generalization in CRL by leveraging the inherent symmetries in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: ECRL introduces Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs and utilizes a rotation-equivariant actor paired with a rotation-invariant critic to structure the latent space in CRL.

Result: ECRL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both state-based and image-based tasks. Its effectiveness is also validated in offline RL settings across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: ECRL demonstrates improved performance in terms of efficiency and generalization by incorporating symmetry-based constraints in the CRL framework.

Abstract: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (CRL) provides a promising framework for
extracting useful structured representations from unlabeled interactions. By
pulling together state-action pairs and their corresponding future states,
while pushing apart negative pairs, CRL enables learning nontrivial policies
without manually designed rewards. In this work, we propose Equivariant CRL
(ECRL), which further structures the latent space using equivariant
constraints. By leveraging inherent symmetries in goal-conditioned manipulation
tasks, our method improves both sample efficiency and spatial generalization.
Specifically, we formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to
characterize rotation-symmetric robotic manipulation tasks, and build on this
by introducing a novel rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a
rotation-equivariant actor for Contrastive RL. Our approach consistently
outperforms strong baselines across a range of simulated tasks in both
state-based and image-based settings. Finally, we extend our method to the
offline RL setting, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an autonomous scan planning method for panoramic RGB-D cameras, achieving efficient 3D scene reconstruction with high coverage and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current panoramic RGB-D cameras require manual operation, which is time-consuming, challenging for novices, and prone to spatial constraints like ensuring feature overlap.

Method: The authors propose a fully autonomous scan planning system that generates efficient, collision-free tour plans with proper viewpoint overlaps for environment scanning.

Result: The planner exhibited excellent performance, achieving 99% scan coverage in real-world tests and being up to three times faster than state-of-the-art view planners.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates significant efficiency and accuracy improvements in 3D scene reconstruction, making it highly promising for real-world applications.

Abstract: Panoramic RGB-D cameras are known for their ability to produce high quality
3D scene reconstructions. However, operating these cameras involves manually
selecting viewpoints and physically transporting the camera, making the
generation of a 3D model time consuming and tedious. Additionally, the process
can be challenging for novice users due to spatial constraints, such as
ensuring sufficient feature overlap between viewpoint frames. To address these
challenges, we propose a fully autonomous scan planning that generates an
efficient tour plan for environment scanning, ensuring collision-free
navigation and adequate overlap between viewpoints within the plan. Extensive
experiments conducted in both synthetic and real-world environments validate
the performance of our planner against state-of-the-art view planners. In
particular, our method achieved an average scan coverage of 99 percent in the
real-world experiment, with our approach being up to 3 times faster than
state-of-the-art planners in total scan time.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated system combining CNN-based structural marker detection and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for robust relative pose estimation in Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions, with adaptive noise tuning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate relative pose estimation is critical for ADR missions targeting tumbling derelict satellites like ENVISAT, where robust navigation techniques are required due to measurement imperfections and dynamic uncertainties.

Method: The approach integrates CNN-based 2D corner detection, camera-based conversion to 3D measurements, and fusion within an Unscented Kalman Filter framework, employing adaptive strategies for both measurement and process noise covariance tuning.

Result: Simulations show improved robustness and accuracy in relative navigation, even under challenging conditions like measurement outages, with estimates closely matching ground truth.

Conclusion: The paper advances onboard relative navigation capabilities for ADR missions, offering a reliable solution to overcome dynamic and measurement challenges in proximity operations.

Abstract: Accurate and robust relative pose estimation is crucial for enabling
challenging Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions targeting tumbling derelict
satellites such as ESA's ENVISAT. This work presents a complete pipeline
integrating advanced computer vision techniques with adaptive nonlinear
filtering to address this challenge. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
enhanced with image preprocessing, detects structural markers (corners) from
chaser imagery, whose 2D coordinates are converted to 3D measurements using
camera modeling. These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative
dynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the
integrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF:
dynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN
measurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance,
utilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or
maneuvers online. This dual adaptation enhances robustness against both
measurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties. The performance of
the proposed adaptive integrated system is evaluated through high-fidelity
simulations using a realistic ENVISAT model, comparing estimates against ground
truth under various conditions, including measurement outages. This
comprehensive approach offers an enhanced solution for robust onboard relative
navigation, significantly advancing the capabilities required for safe
proximity operations during ADR missions.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments reveal that the proposed approach leads to notable improvements in LiDAR localization accuracy through trajectory selection.

Conclusion: GFM-Planner enables robots to actively navigate feature-rich paths, improving their localization performance in challenging environments.

Abstract: Like humans who rely on landmarks for orientation, autonomous robots depend
on feature-rich environments for accurate localization. In this paper, we
propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based
on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by
guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric
Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we
design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM
values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further
proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we
develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR
localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories
through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories
that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption by optimizing kinetic and potential energy conversion.

Conclusion: The bio-inspired trajectory planning framework provides effective energy optimization for construction robots, offering practical and theoretical advancements.

Abstract: As the robotics market rapidly evolves, energy consumption has become a
critical issue, particularly restricting the application of construction
robots. To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from
the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a
bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy
conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography
(EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory
planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption
patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve
dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on
human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired
movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks,
validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method.
Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through

Result: Optimal leg segment proportions were identified, tailoring the robot's design for improved motion versatility.

Conclusion: This study builds a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for designing legged robots with enhanced autonomous mobility in challenging construction scenarios.

Abstract: Faced with complex and unstructured construction environments, wheeled and
tracked robots exhibit significant limitations in terrain adaptability and
flexibility, making it difficult to meet the requirements of autonomous
operation. Inspired by ants in nature, this paper proposes a leg configuration
design and optimization method tailored for construction scenarios, aiming to
enhance the autonomous mobility of construction robots. This paper analyzes the
full operational motion performance of the leg during both swing and stance
phases. First, based on kinematic modeling and multi-dimensional workspace
analysis, the concept of an "improved workspace" is introduced, and graphical
methods are used to optimize the leg dimensions during the swing phase.
Furthermore, a new concept of "average manipulability" is introduced based on
the velocity Jacobian matrix, and numerical solutions are applied to obtain the
leg segment ratio that maximizes manipulability. To overcome the difficulties
associated with traditional analytical methods, virtual prototype simulations
are conducted in ADAMS to explore the relationship between the robot body's
optimal flexibility and leg segment proportions. In summary, the leg segment
proportions with the best comprehensive motion performance are obtained. This
study presents the first multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework

Iterative calculations and structural reconstruction are performed for lightweighting the femur section that is the heaviest part of the leg.

Result: The femur's mass was reduced by 19.45%, resulting in an overall robot leg weight reduction of 7.92%. Static and modal analysis confirmed the optimized leg maintained required structural performance.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a lightweight design for robotic legs while maintaining structural integrity, offering a foundation for efficient operation of construction robots in complex terrains.

Abstract: In complex terrain construction environments, there are high demands for
robots to achieve both high payload capacity and mobility flexibility. As the
key load-bearing component, the optimization of robotic leg structures is of
particular importance. Therefore, this study focuses on the optimization of leg
structures for construction robots, proposing a topology optimization strategy
based on the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) variable
density method along with a structural re-design approach. The design
performance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using
ANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the
rationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the
SIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which
accounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative
calculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After
optimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\%, and the overall leg
mass decreases by 7.92\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally,
static and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg. The results
demonstrate that the optimized leg still meets structural performance
requirements, validating the feasibility of lightweight design. This research
provides robust theoretical and technical support for lightweight construction
robot design and lays a foundation for their efficient operation in complex

TL;DR: This paper introduces a streamlined method for humanoid robot whole-body calibration using a single plane, embedded sensors, and an admittance controller, alongside an algorithm (IROC) to select minimal optimal calibration postures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robot calibration is often neglected due to its time-consuming and challenging nature, despite its importance for accurate control and simulation.

Method: The paper proposes a new method leveraging a single plane, embedded sensors, an admittance controller, and a novel algorithm IROC to optimally select minimal calibration postures.

Result: The proposed approach was validated on the TALOS humanoid robot, utilizing 31 optimal postures, achieving a 2.3 times reduction in average RMS error compared to the manufacturer's model.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates a practical, efficient, and effective solution for calibrating humanoid robots without manual intervention, significantly enhancing kinematic accuracy.

Abstract: Whole-body geometric calibration of humanoid robots using classical robot
calibration methods is a timeconsuming and experimentally burdensome task.
However, despite its significance for accurate control and simulation, it is
often overlooked in the humanoid robotics community. To address this issue, we
propose a novel practical method that utilizes a single plane, embedded force
sensors, and an admittance controller to calibrate the whole-body kinematics of
humanoids without requiring manual intervention. Given the complexity of
humanoid robots, it is crucial to generate and determine a minimal set of
optimal calibration postures. To do so, we propose a new algorithm called IROC
(Information Ranking algorithm for selecting Optimal Calibration postures).
IROC requires a pool of feasible candidate postures to build a normalized
weighted information matrix for each posture. Then, contrary to other
algorithms from the literature, IROC will determine the minimal number of
optimal postures that are to be played onto a robot for its calibration. Both
IROC and the single-plane calibration method were experimentally validated on a
TALOS humanoid robot. The total whole-body kinematics chain was calibrated
using solely 31 optimal postures with 3-point contacts on a table by the robot
gripper. In a cross-validation experiment, the average root-mean-square (RMS)
error was reduced by a factor of 2.3 compared to the manufacturer's model.

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to enhance Formation Control with Collision Avoidance in Multi-Agent Systems using dynamic reward functions generated by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing effective reward functions for MARL in achieving Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA).

Method: A framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic, online-adjustable reward functions based on advanced evaluation metrics.

Result: Efficient simultaneous formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments with fewer iterations and superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves effective for FCCA, validated through both simulations and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through
the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies
employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of
the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex
objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an
effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy
network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework
that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on
the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each
agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically
adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced
evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables
the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in
dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to
reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both
simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness

### [261] [AI or Human? Understanding Perceptions of Embodied Robots with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16398)
*Lavinia Hriscu,Alberto Sanfeliu,Anais Garrell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how people perceive intelligence in AI- versus human-controlled robots via a Turing Test evaluation and interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how the Turing Test can be adapted for human-robot interaction and analyze perceptions of intelligence in robotic platforms.

Method: Participants interacted with robots in information retrieval and package handover tasks while distinguishing them as AI- or human-controlled.

Result: Participants were unable to reliably distinguish AI-controlled from human-controlled robots, and key factors influencing perception were identified.

Conclusion: Insights gained contribute to refining interactive robot design and advancing intelligence evaluation methods in AI systems.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long been associated to the the
challenge of effectively measuring intelligence. Even if the Turing Test was
introduced as a means of assessing a system intelligence, its relevance and
application within the field of human-robot interaction remain largely
underexplored. This study investigates the perception of intelligence in
embodied robots by performing a Turing Test within a robotic platform. A total
of 34 participants were tasked with distinguishing between AI- and
human-operated robots while engaging in two interactive tasks: an information
retrieval and a package handover. These tasks assessed the robot perception and
navigation abilities under both static and dynamic conditions. Results indicate
that participants were unable to reliably differentiate between AI- and
human-controlled robots beyond chance levels. Furthermore, analysis of
participant responses reveals key factors influencing the perception of
artificial versus human intelligence in embodied robotic systems. These
findings provide insights into the design of future interactive robots and
contribute to the ongoing discourse on intelligence assessment in AI-driven
systems.

### [262] [Distributed Oscillatory Guidance for Formation Flight of Fixed-Wing Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16458)
*Yang Xu,Jesús Bautista,José Hinojosa,Héctor García de Marina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an algorithm for formation flights of fixed-wing drones by using path-based oscillatory behaviors instead of direct speed actuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-wing drones struggle to coordinate formation flights due to limitations in adjusting their airspeeds.

Method: The method involves guiding drones along specific paths with oscillations in the guiding vector field, and a novel consensus algorithm adjusts oscillation amplitudes.

Result: The approach was validated through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world flights.

Conclusion: The algorithm enables fixed-wing drones to achieve coordinated formation flights without direct speed control.

Abstract: The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the
coordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically
bounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This
paper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones
without requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all
the drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we
superpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the
drones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity
along the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone
adjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by
communicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A
novel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric
saturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative
amplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along
the path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by
validation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight.

### [263] [Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16480)
*Sabrina Livanec,Laura Londoño,Michael Gorki,Adrian Röfer,Abhinav Valada,Andrea Kiesel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines how participants evaluate human-robot collaboration behaviors, focusing on diverse human conditions and prosocial robot design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on how participants assess robot behaviors while interacting with individuals from protected groups, given their limited experience with advanced domestic robots.

Method: An online study involved 112 participants evaluating videos of human-robot collaboration types, with some completing a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise beforehand.

Result: Experimental participants provided more nuanced assessments due to CAM reflection. Antisocial robot behavior was rated lowest, collaboration with aged individuals elicited sensitive evaluations, and object handover scenarios received positive feedback.

Conclusion: Human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence perceptions of collaborative robots, emphasizing the need for prosocial design and reflective evaluation methods to develop socially responsible systems targeted at diverse groups.

Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.

### [264] [Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481)
*Riccardo Bussola,Michele Focchi,Giulio Turrisi,Claudio Semini,Luigi Palopoli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a guided reinforcement learning approach for efficient and explainable jumping in quadruped robots, leveraging physical models like Bézier curves and UARM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jumping is challenging for quadruped robots, and current approaches such as optimization methods are time-intensive, require detailed parameters, or involve inefficient RL methods with poor safety and predictability.

Method: The approach integrates physical intuition using Bézier curves and a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model within a guided reinforcement learning framework.

Result: Extensive simulation and experimental results confirm the efficiency and advantages of the guided RL approach over existing methods.

Conclusion: The guided RL method improves the efficiency and safety of jumping motions in quadruped robots, providing a practical and effective alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being
crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for
controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive
knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in
real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable
alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of
sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and
predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the
safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages
physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier
curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive
simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our
approach over existing alternatives.

*Lorenzo Gentilini,Pierpaolo Serio,Valentina Donzella,Lorenzo Pollini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a target-based calibration system for multi-LiDAR and multi-camera setups to enhance alignment accuracy using a custom ChArUco board and nonlinear optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate extrinsic calibration is critical for autonomous driving systems due to safety implications arising from misaligned sensor data in diverse environments.

Method: The paper develops a system utilizing a custom ChArUco board and a nonlinear optimization technique for calibrating multi-LiDAR-multi-camera sensor suites with minimal prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments conducted in a warehouse validate the method's effectiveness and demonstrate its feasibility for various sensor types.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration approach significantly improves sensor alignment in autonomous driving setups, paving the way for safer and more adaptable perception pipelines.

Abstract: Extrinsic Calibration represents the cornerstone of autonomous driving. Its
accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can
have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect
different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the
data. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system
tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables
cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using
a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test
the system with real-world data gathered in a warehouse. Results demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the feasibility of a
unique pipeline tailored for various types of sensors.

### [266] [Morpheus: A Neural-driven Animatronic Face with Hybrid Actuation and Diverse Emotion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16645)
*Zongzheng Zhang,Jiawen Yang,Ziqiao Peng,Meng Yang,Jianzhu Ma,Lin Cheng,Huazhe Xu,Hang Zhao,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid actuation approach combining rigid and tendon-driven mechanisms for animatronic faces, paired with a self-modeling neural network for mapping emotions and speech to facial expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier animatronic faces struggled to express emotions effectively due to limitations in hardware design and control algorithms.

Method: The hardware combines rigid mechanisms for key expression areas (eyes and mouth) and tendon-driven mechanisms for subtle parts (nose and cheeks). The software uses a self-modeling network to map motor actions to facial landmarks and another neural network to link speech input with emotional blendshapes.

Result: The system achieves distinct emotional expressions (happiness, fear, disgust, anger) with nuanced controls generated from speech inputs. This performance exceeds earlier animatronic systems.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach and the use of neural networks allow for compact, versatile, and expressive animatronic faces capable of realistic emotional expression. Hardware and code are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Previous animatronic faces struggle to express emotions effectively due to
hardware and software limitations. On the hardware side, earlier approaches
either use rigid-driven mechanisms, which provide precise control but are
difficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms,
which are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we
propose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The
eyes and mouth-key areas for emotional expression-are controlled using rigid
mechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle
facial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build
a compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of
emotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling
network that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to
automatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for
different facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals
through gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech
input to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate
distinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger,
from any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals-a
feature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems. We release the
hardware design and code at https://github.com/ZZongzheng0918/Morpheus-Hardware

*Guowei Lan,Kaixian Qu,René Zurbrügg,Changan Chen,Christopher E. Mower,Haitham Bou-Ammar,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ExpTeach, a framework to ground vision-language models (VLMs) in physical robotics, leveraging self-generated experiences to boost robotic task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models, trained on internet data, struggle with grounding in diverse robotic applications, which limits autonomous planning in real-world settings.

Method: ExpTeach autonomously processes action planning, failure reflection, behavior adaptation, and creates long-term memory from experiences. It utilizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and an on-demand image annotation module.

Result: Experiments demonstrated significant improvements in task success rates: reflection boosted success from 36% to 84%, and long-term memory increased single-trial success from 22% to 80%.

Conclusion: Grounding VLMs using self-generated experiences and long-term memory makes them more effective and generalizable for real-world robotic tasks, showcasing advances in intelligent object interactions.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable
autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet
data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents
ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a
self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM
autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts
robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this
process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of
learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with
an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection
improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and
observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative
tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight
unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial
success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of ExpTeach.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlgoTune, a benchmark for testing language models in designing efficient algorithms for computational problems, revealing models' current limitations in discovering innovative solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate language models on open-ended tasks requiring creativity and problem-solving capabilities, beyond strictly replicating tasks already solved by humans.

Method: They curated a benchmark of 155 coding tasks and developed a validation framework to test and compare LM-generated solutions against reference implementations. Additionally, they introduced a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner.

Result: AlgoTuner demonstrated improved performance, achieving an average 1.72x speedup over reference solvers. However, the models failed to create fundamentally innovative algorithms, focusing instead on minor optimizations.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that current LMs lack creativity in problem-solving, but AlgoTune can drive advancements in models' ability to innovate beyond existing state-of-the-art human solutions.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus
far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved,
including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al.,
2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement
algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that
efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science,
physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks
collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing
LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations
from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent,
AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models.
AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers,
which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that
current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring
surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of
LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human
performance.

### [269] [Dr. Boot: Bootstrapping Program Synthesis Language Models to Perform Repairing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15889)
*Noah van der Vleuten*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bootstrapping algorithm for training language models in program synthesis, emphasizing iterative code repair over single-shot code generation and achieving performance comparable to larger fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models for program synthesis lack sufficient high-quality data and misalign with human iterative approaches to coding, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: A bootstrapping algorithm is proposed that trains language models to iteratively repair code. It incorporates a repairing mechanism during training and evaluates its impact on program synthesis performance compared to traditional fine-tuning.

Result: The bootstrapped models outperform standard fine-tuning methods, achieving performance on par with models 68% larger. Repairing during inference proves inferior to solution sampling, but repairing-based training enhances non-repairing inference outcomes.

Conclusion: Bootstrapping with repairing improves program synthesis while highlighting issues in the APPS training dataset, offering valuable insights for the dataset's refinement and for advancing reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Language models for program synthesis are usually trained and evaluated on
programming competition datasets (MBPP, APPS). However, these datasets are
limited in size and quality, while these language models are extremely data
hungry. Additionally, the language models have a misaligned program synthesis
process compared to humans. While humans iteratively develop code with the help
of a compiler, most program synthesis models currently produce code in one go.
To solve these issues, we introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for program
synthesis, that supports teaching models how to repair. We show that
bootstrapping consistently outperforms regular fine-tuning. Compared to other
work, our bootstrapped model performs on par with fine-tuned models that are
68\% larger. Notably, bootstrapping with repairing also improves non-repairing
performance compared to regular bootstrapping during inference. However, on our
models, repairing during inference is likely inferior to simply sampling the
same number of solutions. Furthermore, we find that there are issues with the
example test cases in the training portion of the APPS dataset that are
valuable to the community, as many repairing and reinforcement learning methods
rely on them.

### [270] [StaAgent: An Agentic Framework for Testing Static Analyzers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15892)
*Elijah Nnorom,Md Basim Uddin Ahmed,Jiho Shin,Hung Viet Pham,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents 'StaAgent,' a framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test and improve static analyzers by revealing inconsistencies in bug detection rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static analyzers are crucial for early bug detection but often have inconsistently tested rules, leading to flawed bug detection. The paper aims to address these inconsistencies.

Method: The StaAgent framework involves four agents—Seed Generation, Code Validation, Mutation Generation, and Analyzer Evaluation—that collectively use LLMs for systematic and scalable testing of static analyzer rules.

Result: StaAgent identified 64 flawed rules in five widely-used static analyzers, with 53 of these undetectable by state-of-the-art methods. Some bugs have already been fixed or confirmed by developers.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of LLM-driven, multi-agent frameworks like StaAgent in improving the reliability of static analyzers and advancing software engineering methodologies.

Abstract: Static analyzers play a critical role in identifying bugs early in the
software development lifecycle, but their rule implementations are often
under-tested and prone to inconsistencies. To address this, we propose
StaAgent, an agentic framework that harnesses the generative capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically evaluate static analyzer rules.
StaAgent comprises four specialized agents: a Seed Generation Agent that
translates bug detection rules into concrete, bug-inducing seed programs; a
Code Validation Agent that ensures the correctness of these seeds; a Mutation
Generation Agent that produces semantically equivalent mutants; and an Analyzer
Evaluation Agent that performs metamorphic testing by comparing the static
analyzer's behavior on seeds and their corresponding mutants. By revealing
inconsistent behaviors, StaAgent helps uncover flaws in rule implementations.
This LLM-driven, multi-agent framework offers a scalable and adaptable solution
to improve the reliability of static analyzers. We evaluated StaAgent with five
state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeL-lama, DeepSeek, Codestral, Qwen, and GPT-4o)
across five widely used static analyzers (SpotBugs, SonarQube, ErrorProne,
Infer, and PMD). The experimental results show that our approach can help
reveal 64 problematic rules in the latest versions of these five static
analyzers (i.e., 28 in SpotBugs, 18 in SonarQube, 6 in ErrorProne, 4 in Infer,
and 8 in PMD). In addition, 53 out of the 64 bugs cannot be detected by the
SOTA baseline. We have reported all the bugs to developers, with two of them
already fixed. Three more have been confirmed by developers, while the rest are
awaiting response. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
and underscore the promise of agentic, LLM-driven data synthesis to advance
software engineering.

*Zhili Zeng,Kimya Khakzad Shahandashti,Alvine Boaye Belle,Song Wang,Zhen Ming,Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating mobile applications between Android and iOS, while identifying failure points and proposing guidelines for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for cross-platform compatibility between Android and iOS mobile applications is growing, and current methods for application translation are either manual, rule-based, or lack contextual understanding and adaptability. The study seeks to address these challenges with machine-learning-based approaches.

Method: The researchers developed a chain of agents to account for dependencies, specifications, program structure, and control flow during Android-to-iOS application translation. They manually evaluated the translated code for correctness, accuracy, and functional completeness. Root cause analysis was conducted on translation failures to pinpoint limitations and improvement opportunities.

Result: The study revealed failure points in application translation by LLMs, providing insights into their limitations in handling application dependencies, specifications, and program structures.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches show potential for automating cross-platform application translation, but careful attention to failure points and improvement strategies is required for better performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of mobile applications has led to a significant demand
for cross-platform compatibility, particularly between the Android and iOS
platforms. Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely
on manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and
time-consuming. While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced
automated methods, they often lack contextual understanding and adaptability,
resulting in suboptimal translations. Large Language Models (LLMs) were
recently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities,
including the method, class, and repository levels. Researchers have
investigated common errors, limitations, and potential strategies to improve
these tasks. However, LLM-based application translation across different
platforms, such as migrating mobile applications between Android and iOS or
adapting software across diverse frameworks, remains underexplored.
Understanding the performance, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in
cross-platform application translation is critical for advancing software
engineering automation. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating
LLM-based agentic approaches for mobile application translation, identifying
key failure points, and proposing guidelines to improve translation
performance. We developed a chain of agents that account for dependencies,
specifications, program structure, and program control flow when translating
applications from Android to iOS. To evaluate the performance, we manually
examined the translated code for syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and
functional completeness. For translation failures, we further conducted a
detailed root cause analysis to understand the underlying limitations of the
agentic translation process and identify opportunities for improvement.

### [272] [Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to Model Context Protocol Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044)
*Meriem Mastouri,Emna Ksontini,Wael Kessentini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents AutoMCP, a compiler for automating the creation of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using OpenAPI specifications, achieving high success rates with minimal manual corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in automating MCP server construction due to the manual and repetitive integration efforts required to implement scalable protocols for tool integration.

Method: AutoMCP is developed as a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI specifications, handling tasks like schema registration, authentication, and server implementation. Evaluation includes real-world APIs and identifies recurring issues in OpenAPI contracts.

Result: Out of 1,023 tool calls tested across 50 APIs, 76.5% succeeded without intervention. After minor fixes to OpenAPI specifications, success rates improved to 99.9%.

Conclusion: OpenAPI specifications, despite their inconsistencies, can effectively automate MCP server generation with AutoMCP, significantly reducing manual development effort and supporting tool integration at scale.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into
active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable
protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP),
introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic
tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and
repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and
configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims
to eliminate.
  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully
automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged
GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include
servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive
scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates
MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API
definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema
registration and authentication handling.
  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across
over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded
out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all
attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After
minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9%
success.
  Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server
development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality
issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a
corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common
specification flaws.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-Powered Commit Explorer (APCE), a tool to assist in the generation and evaluation of commit messages using Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often neglect writing high-quality commit messages, even though they are crucial for describing code changes. LLM-generated commit messages provide an opportunity to address this gap.

Method: The APCE tool allows researchers to store and manage LLM prompts, use enhanced evaluation prompts for better commit messages, and supports both automated and human evaluations of these messages.

Result: APCE simplifies the process of generating, improving, and assessing LLM-generated commit messages, making it useful for both developers and researchers.

Conclusion: APCE is a novel tool designed to improve the quality and evaluation process of commit messages through the use of LLMs, addressing a practical need in software development.

Abstract: Commit messages in a version control system provide valuable information for
developers regarding code changes in software systems. Commit messages can be
the only source of information left for future developers describing what was
changed and why. However, writing high-quality commit messages is often
neglected in practice. Large Language Model (LLM) generated commit messages
have emerged as a way to mitigate this issue. We introduce the AI-Powered
Commit Explorer (APCE), a tool to support developers and researchers in the use
and study of LLM-generated commit messages. APCE gives researchers the option
to store different prompts for LLMs and provides an additional evaluation
prompt that can further enhance the commit message provided by LLMs. APCE also
provides researchers with a straightforward mechanism for automated and human
evaluation of LLM-generated messages. Demo link https://youtu.be/zYrJ9s6sZvo

Motivation: Challenges in using general Large Language Models (LLMs) for design-to-code conversion due to limitations in interpretability, scalability, and repeatability.

Method: Introduced LDMs with a training pipeline including Design Optimiser, Tagging & Feature Detection, and Auto Components, paired with an inference pipeline for real-world application.

Result: LDMs demonstrate superior end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy, outperforming LLMs in positioning, responsiveness, and reproducibility metrics.

Conclusion: LDMs provide an advanced and reliable solution for converting designs into efficient, production-ready code, addressing key limitations of generic LLMs.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language
Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability,
resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in
the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models
(LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless
conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference
pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture
modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design
Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses
sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and
fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI
elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable
components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while
enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but
key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline
processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions
for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models
illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a
novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior
performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning,
responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and
feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in
identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our
proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs
that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable
production-ready code.

### [276] [Search-based Generation of Waypoints for Triggering Self-Adaptations in Maritime Autonomous Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16327)
*Karoline Nylænder,Aitor Arrieta,Shaukat Ali,Paolo Arcaini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces WPgen, a software tool that strategically modifies navigation waypoints to test the adaptability and dependability of maritime autonomous vessels (AVs) under unexpected situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the dependability and adaptability of maritime autonomous vessels by identifying conditions that warrant self-adaptation during navigation.

Method: The authors propose WPgen, a multi-objective search-based approach using NSGA-II and three seeding strategies to generate modified waypoints for testing AV navigation software.

Result: WPgen was evaluated on three autonomous vessels, where its effectiveness differed based on the vessel type. Comparisons with Random Search served as baseline results.

Conclusion: WPgen demonstrates varied effectiveness across different AVs, providing insights into improving adaptive navigation software behavior and dependability requirements for real-world implementations.

Abstract: Self-adaptation in maritime autonomous vessels (AVs) enables them to adapt
their behaviors to address unexpected situations while maintaining
dependability requirements. During the design of such AVs, it is crucial to
understand and identify the settings that should trigger adaptations, enabling
validation of their implementation. To this end, we focus on the navigation
software of AVs, which must adapt their behavior during operation through
adaptations. AVs often rely on predefined waypoints to guide them along
designated routes, ensuring safe navigation. We propose a multiobjective
search-based approach, called WPgen, to generate minor modifications to the
predefined set of waypoints, keeping them as close as possible to the original
waypoints, while causing the AV to navigate inappropriately when navigating
with the generated waypoints. WPgen uses NSGA-II as the multi-objective search
algorithm with three seeding strategies for its initial population, resulting
in three variations of WPgen. We evaluated these variations on three AVs (one
overwater tanker and two underwater). We compared the three variations of WPgen
with Random Search as the baseline and with each other. Experimental results
showed that the effectiveness of these variations varied depending on the AV.
Based on the results, we present the research and practical implications of
WPgen.

### [277] [Improving Code LLM Robustness to Prompt Perturbations via Layer-Aware Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16407)
*Shuhan Liu,Xing Hu,Kerui Huang,Xiaohu Yang,David Lo,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs excel in code generation, but perform poorly when prompts are slightly altered. CREME addresses this by enhancing robustness through model editing, boosting accuracy without harming performance on clean inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minor modifications in prompts, common in real-world scenarios, significantly hinder the code generation capabilities of LLMs. Improving model robustness is essential to ensure reliable results in practical applications.

Method: CREME identifies layers sensitive to robustness by comparing hidden states of original and perturbed prompts. It then applies lightweight parameter edits in these layers to improve performance degradation.

Result: CREME achieves a 63% accuracy improvement on perturbed prompts (Pass@1) while maintaining less than 1% deviation for clean prompts, proving its effectiveness in enhancing robustness.

Conclusion: Robustness-sensitive layers are largely found in middle and deeper layers, and their positions vary across architectures. This lays a foundation for further advancements in robustness-focused model editing strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, where the natural language prompt plays a crucial role in
conveying user intent to the model. However, prior studies have shown that LLMs
are highly sensitive to prompt perturbations. Minor modifications in wording,
syntax, or formatting can significantly reduce the functional correctness of
generated code. As perturbations frequently occur in real-world scenarios,
improving the robustness of LLMs to prompt perturbations is essential for
ensuring reliable performance in practical code generation. In this paper, we
introduce CREME (Code Robustness Enhancement via Model Editing), a novel
approach that enhances LLM robustness through targeted parameter updates. CREME
first identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between
an original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight
parameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We
evaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and
MBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that
CREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining
stable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%. Further
analysis reveals that robustness-sensitive layers are primarily concentrated in
the middle and deeper layers of the network, and their locations vary across
different model architectures. These insights provide a valuable foundation for
developing future robustness-oriented editing strategies.

### [278] [Exploring Large Language Models for Analyzing and Improving Method Names in Scientific Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16439)
*Gunnar Larsen,Carol Wong,Anthony Peruma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates four LLMs' capabilities in assessing and improving method names in Python-based scientific software, showing potential but inconsistent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and automate the quality improvement of method names in scientific software using LLMs, addressing a less explored area in research software.

Method: Evaluation of four popular LLMs on their ability to analyze and suggest improvements for 496 method names from Python-based Jupyter Notebooks.

Result: LLMs show moderate effectiveness, generally follow good naming practices, but face challenges in handling domain-specific terms and achieving agreement with human annotations.

Conclusion: AI-driven suggestions for scientific code quality improvement have potential but require human oversight for domain-specific accuracy.

Abstract: Research scientists increasingly rely on implementing software to support
their research. While previous research has examined the impact of identifier
names on program comprehension in traditional programming environments, limited
work has explored this area in scientific software, especially regarding the
quality of method names in the code. The recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for automating code analysis tasks,
such as identifier name appraisals and recommendations. Our study evaluates
four popular LLMs on their ability to analyze grammatical patterns and suggest
improvements for 496 method names extracted from Python-based Jupyter
Notebooks. Our findings show that the LLMs are somewhat effective in analyzing
these method names and generally follow good naming practices, like starting
method names with verbs. However, their inconsistent handling of
domain-specific terminology and only moderate agreement with human annotations
indicate that automated suggestions require human evaluation. This work
provides foundational insights for improving the quality of scientific code
through AI automation.

### [279] [On the Effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge for Code Generation and Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16587)
*Giuseppe Crupi,Rosalia Tufano,Alejandro Velasco,Antonio Mastropaolo,Denys Poshyvanyk,Gabriele Bavota*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how effective LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-turbo) are in judging code generation and summarization tasks, revealing strengths as well as notable inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether LLMs can serve as judges for assessing outputs in complex tasks, focusing on code generation and summarization due to the limitations of traditional metrics and challenges in human evaluation.

Method: The study tests eight LLMs for code correctness evaluations and compares judgments of five LLMs against nine human judges for code summaries, analyzing Java and Python examples.

Result: GPT-4-turbo emerges as the most effective judging LLM for both tasks, outperforming smaller models. However, it still frequently misjudges code correctness and summary quality.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as task judges, but even top-performing models like GPT-4-turbo exhibit significant limitations, suggesting the need for further improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex
natural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate
to an LLM the assessment of the "quality" of the output provided by an
automated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only
tell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be
too expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can
also unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a
solution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what
is the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of
LLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code
summarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,
quantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code
summarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as
BLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,
even state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances
of these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced
solutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check
whether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and
1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For
code summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by
nine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our
findings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities
for both tasks, with "smaller" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not
being able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM
frequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality.

*Tan Bui,Yan Naing Tun,Thanh Phuc Nguyen,Yindu Su,Ferdian Thung,Yikun Li,Han Wei Ang,Yide Yin,Frank Liauw,Lwin Khin Shar,Eng Lieh Ouh,Ting Zhang,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces VulCoCo, a new method for detecting vulnerable code clones in software using embedding-based retrieval and large language model validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting vulnerable code clones while overcoming the limitations of existing tools, which rely heavily on syntactic similarity or coarse predictions.

Method: Developed VulCoCo, combining embedding-based retrieval to locate candidate code functions and validation via a large language model to assess if vulnerabilities persist.

Result: VulCoCo surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in Precision@k and mean average precision (MAP) benchmarks, and identifies vulnerabilities in real-world projects, leading to new CVEs.

Conclusion: VulCoCo is effective at identifying vulnerable code clones and its approach can inspire further advancements to enhance detection precision.

Abstract: Code reuse is common in modern software development, but it can also spread
vulnerabilities when developers unknowingly copy risky code. The code fragments
that preserve the logic of known vulnerabilities are known as vulnerable code
clones (VCCs). Detecting those VCCs is a critical but challenging task.
Existing VCC detection tools often rely on syntactic similarity or produce
coarse vulnerability predictions without clear explanations, limiting their
practical utility. In this paper, we propose VulCoCo, a lightweight and
scalable approach that combines embedding-based retrieval with large language
model (LLM) validation. Starting from a set of known vulnerable functions, we
retrieve syntactically or semantically similar candidate functions from a large
corpus and use an LLM to assess whether the candidates retain the
vulnerability. Given that there is a lack of reproducible vulnerable code clone
benchmarks, we first construct a synthetic benchmark that spans various clone
types.
  Our experiments on the benchmark show that VulCoCo outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Precision@k and mean average precision
(MAP). In addition, we also demonstrate VulCoCo's effectiveness in real-world
projects by submitting 400 pull requests (PRs) to 284 open-source projects.
Among them, 75 PRs were merged, and 15 resulted in newly published CVEs. We
also provide insights to inspire future work to further improve the precision
of vulnerable code clone detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reproducibility and efficiency in JIT-VP research by automating commit analysis and integrating modern prediction models.

Method: Automated mining of GitHub commits, extracting code changes, commit messages, and metrics, with integrated evaluation of vulnerability prediction models.

Result: Demonstrated VulGuard's effectiveness in open-source projects like FFmpeg and the Linux kernel, showcasing its scalability.

Conclusion: VulGuard accelerates JIT-VP research, simplifies benchmarking, and is adaptable to CI/CD pipelines for software security workflows.

Abstract: We present VulGuard, an automated tool designed to streamline the extraction,
processing, and analysis of commits from GitHub repositories for Just-In-Time
vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP) research. VulGuard automatically mines commit
histories, extracts fine-grained code changes, commit messages, and software
engineering metrics, and formats them for downstream analysis. In addition, it
integrates several state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction models, allowing
researchers to train, evaluate, and compare models with minimal setup. By
supporting both repository-scale mining and model-level experimentation within
a unified framework, VulGuard addresses key challenges in reproducibility and
scalability in software security research. VulGuard can also be easily
integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
tool in two influential open-source projects, FFmpeg and the Linux kernel,
highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world JIT-VP research and promote
standardized benchmarking. A demo video is available at:

### [282] [Never Come Up Empty: Adaptive HyDE Retrieval for Improving LLM Developer Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16754)
*Fangjian Lei,Mariam El Mezouar,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in enhancing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for answering developer questions, demonstrating improvements in answer quality across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing hallucinations and unreliable answers from LLMs when assisting developers with code-related queries.

Method: Created a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Stack Overflow posts, tested 7 RAG pipelines with 63 variants, and developed methods for addressing unseen questions through context retrieval adjustments.

Result: Discovering that the HyDE-based RAG pipeline with full-answer context outperformed zero-shot LLMs, significantly enhancing helpfulness, correctness, and detail.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG pipelines consistently improve answer quality for developer questions, offering robust enhancements across different LLMs and varying query scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting developers with
code-related questions; however, LLMs carry the risk of generating unreliable
answers. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been
proposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,
designing effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design
choices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java
and Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore
various RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their
effectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,
we (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants
to answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new
questions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the
similarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding
partially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find
that implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding
(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering
similarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG
pipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot
performance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline
consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher
scores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These
findings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer
quality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen
and novel questions across different LLMs

### [283] [Rethinking LLM-Based RTL Code Optimization Via Timing Logic Metamorphosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16808)
*Zhihao Xu,Bixin Li,Lulu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for RTL code optimization, highlighting their strengths in logic operations but limitations in handling complex timing logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning and heuristic-based methods for RTL optimization are time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, leveraging LLMs to simplify and expedite this process is critical.

Method: The authors propose a new benchmark to evaluate RTL optimization and use a metamorphic evaluation method to systematically assess the performance of LLM-based optimization methods.

Result: Findings show that LLMs outperform compiler methods for logic operations but struggle with complex timing logic optimization, especially in timing control flow and clock domain optimization.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for certain RTL optimization tasks but require further advancements to effectively handle complex timing logic.

Abstract: Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high
performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design. However,
traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics,
which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to
leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs
can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions,
potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches
have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization
methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we
conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of
LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex
timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL
optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a
specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on
metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL
code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization
effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more
complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.
(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic
operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL
optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods
on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow
optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the
challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these
findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL
code optimization.

*Paolo Agliati,André Urbano,Pablo Lanillos,Nasir Ahmad,Marcel van Gerven,Sander Keemink*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method for using spiking neural networks (SNNs) for control tasks, moving away from rate-based signals and enabling sparse neural activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of spiking control use rate-based representations to approximate analog control, which requires continuous energy and is hard to scale. The study aims to develop a scalable, efficient, and biologically-inspired spiking control method.

Method: The authors propose a spiking rule where neurons spike only when it moves a system closer to a target. They derive mathematical formulations for the required SNN connectivity and dynamics, and demonstrate the method's effectiveness on linear systems with predictive control leveraging passive dynamics.

Result: The method successfully enables task-specific spiking control, scales to high-dimensional systems and networks, and preserves closed-form mathematical derivations for connectivity and dynamics.

Conclusion: This work enhances the understanding of SNNs as efficient control mechanisms inspired by biological neurons, facilitating their application to neuromorphic hardware while being analytically sound and energy-efficient.

Abstract: Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief
electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets
such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in
connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as
controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events
directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging
as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical
tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering
the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal,
necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we
circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method
for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we
take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define
a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system
closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity
for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show
that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and
the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream
system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to
both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we
maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the
network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the
understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight
into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in
neuromorphic hardware design.

*Arya Adyasha,Anushka Sanjay Shelke,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study analyzes electrodermal activity (EDA) in individuals with and without social anxiety during a cognitive task, finding no significant differences in autonomic arousal between the groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether heightened physiological arousal in socially anxious individuals extends to non-social-evaluative tasks, particularly in the context of cognitive stressors.

Method: The study involved 50 participants (25 SA, 25 NSA) performing a working memory task using facial expressions while collecting EDA data. Several EDA features, like tonic and phasic components and skin conductance responses, were analyzed using a standardized approach.

Result: Both SA and NSA participants showed increased EDA from baseline to the task, indicating elevated autonomic arousal during cognitive stress, but there were no significant differences between the groups.

Conclusion: Cognitive-emotional stress, without social-evaluative threats, induces similar physiological responses in both socially anxious and non-anxious individuals. Future research should consider social-evaluative or recovery contexts to better identify group differences.

Abstract: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with heightened physiological
arousal in social-evaluative contexts, but it remains unclear whether such
autonomic reactivity extends to non-evaluative cognitive stressors. This study
investigated electrodermal activity (EDA) patterns in socially anxious (SA) and
non-socially anxious (NSA) individuals during an emotionally salient 2-back
working memory task using facial expressions. 50 participants (25 SA, 25 NSA)
completed both a baseline rest period and the task while EDA data were
collected via the Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor. A range of EDA features, such as tonic
and phasic components, number and amplitude of skin conductance responses, and
sympathetic activation estimates, were analyzed using a standardized,
interval-based approach. Results revealed significant increases in EDA across
all participants from baseline to task, indicating elevated autonomic arousal
during cognitive load. However, no significant group differences were found
between SA and NSA individuals. These findings suggest that cognitive-emotional
stress, in the absence of social-evaluative threat, elicits comparable
physiological responses regardless of social anxiety status. The results
underscore the context-dependent nature of anxiety-related autonomic reactivity
and advocate for the inclusion of social-evaluative or recovery phases in
future research to detect more nuanced group effects.

*Riki Shimizu,Richard J. Antonello,Chandan Singh,Nima Mesgarani*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how different interpretable speech feature types and self-supervised speech models (SSMs) align with brain activity, using electrocorticography (ECoG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand what drives the alignment between self-supervised speech models (SSMs) and brain responses, a topic that remains unclear due to SSMs' black-box nature.

Method: Six feature families—including interpretable features and representations from three self-supervised models (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM)—were analyzed for their capacity to predict ECoG neural responses. Variance-partitioning was used to dissect shared and unique contributions.

Result: Interpretable features predicted ECoG responses better than SSMs alone. Combining interpretable features with SSMs yielded the best neural predictions, and analyses revealed SSMs retain crucial acoustic and semantic information relevant to neural encoding.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the value of interpretable features in understanding speech perception and neural alignment, challenging assumptions about low-level and semantic information in SSM layers.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models (SSMs) are increasingly hailed as more powerful
computational models of human speech perception than models based on
traditional hand-crafted features. However, since their representations are
inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain
responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six
interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features,
speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic Question-Answering features,
and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SSMs (Whisper,
HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying the shared and unique neural variance captured by
each feature class. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, our interpretable model
predicted electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to speech more accurately than
any SSM. Moreover, augmenting SSM representations with interpretable features
yielded the best overall neural predictions, significantly outperforming either
class alone. Further variance-partitioning analyses revealed previously
unresolved components of SSM representations that contribute to their neural
alignment: 1. Despite the common assumption that later layers of SSMs discard
low-level acoustic information, these models compress and preferentially retain
frequency bands critical for neural encoding of speech (100-1000 Hz). 2.
Contrary to previous claims, SSMs encode brain-relevant semantic information
that cannot be reduced to lower-level features, improving with context length
and model size. These results highlight the importance of using refined,
interpretable features in understanding speech perception.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using information-theoretical measures to analyze EEG data during a Go/NoGo task, demonstrating that complexity and entropy metrics can effectively differentiate between trial types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of complexity measures and symbolic information approaches for identifying differences in brain activity related to cognitive processes, particularly during Go/NoGo tasks.

Method: Human EEG data was analyzed using information-theoretical quantifiers such as entropy and complexity. The Bandt-Pompe symbolization method was applied to calculate probability distributions and information theory indices for differentiating trial types.

Result: The analysis revealed that certain EEG channels consistently differentiated Go/NoGo trials at both individual and group levels. Trial types formed distinct clusters in the complexity-entropy plane, and specific time windows were more effective for classification.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for enhancing understanding of neural dynamics during cognitive tasks, with robust results for distinguishing Go/NoGo trials using information-theoretical measures in both individuals and group data.

Abstract: Complexity is a ubiquitous concept in contemporary science and everyday life.
A complex dynamical system is usually characterized by a blend of order and
disorder, as well as emergent phenomena that often span multiple temporal and
spatial scales. The information processes related to different cognitive
processes in the brain can be studied in light of statistical differences based
on complexity measures of the electrophysiological time series from different
trial types. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a symbolic information
approach can be a valuable tool for discriminating response-related differences
between Go and NoGo trials using the local field potential of brain regions in
monkeys. The method shows significant differences between trial types earlier
than the simple average of the electrical signals. Here, we analyze human
electroencephalogram data during a Go/NoGo task using information-theoretical
quantifiers, including entropy and complexity. We employ the Bandt-Pompe
symbolization methodology to determine a probability distribution function for
each time series and then to calculate information theory indices. We show that
a few channels, especially a central and an occipital electrode, consistently
differentiate Go/NoGo trials at the individual level. We also show that
different trial types occupy separate regions in the complexity-entropy plane.
Our method also captures specific time windows to better differentiate the
trial type. Moreover, we show that our results are robust at the group level,
considering the average activity of all subjects.

Result: The integration of three research areas produced a multilayered model of depression, spanning circuit, systems, computational, and behavioral levels.

Conclusion: This model offers fresh perspectives for future research and enhances the understanding of depression's underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder persistently stands as a major public health
problem. While some progress has been made toward effective treatments, the
neural mechanisms that give rise to the disorder remain poorly understood. In
this Perspective, we put forward a new theory of the pathophysiology of
depression. More precisely, we spotlight three previously separate bodies of
research, showing how they can be fit together into a previously overlooked
larger picture. The first piece of the puzzle is provided by pathophysiology
research implicating dopamine in depression. The second piece, coming from
computational psychiatry, links depression with a special form of reinforcement
learning. The third and final piece involves recent work at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and basic neuroscience research, indicating that the
brain may represent value using a distributional code. Fitting these three
pieces together yields a new model of depression's pathophysiology, which spans
circuit, systems, computational and behavioral levels, opening up new
directions for research.

### [289] [Structural DID with ML: Theory, Simulation, and a Roadmap for Applied Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15899)
*Yile Yu,Anzhi Xu,Yi Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced framework, S-DIDML, to overcome limitations of traditional difference-in-differences (DID) methods and machine learning in causal inference within high-dimensional panel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DID methods struggle with high-dimensional confounders, while machine learning lacks causal interpretability, necessitating an integrated approach for robust causal inference.

Method: S-DIDML builds on traditional DID by employing Neyman orthogonality and cross-fitting techniques, alongside combining causal forests and semi-parametric models to address both identification and heterogeneity challenges.

Result: The framework standardizes modular applications, offers replicable evaluation tools, optimizes policy-sensitive group identification, and enhances resource allocation precision for complex interventions.

Conclusion: S-DIDML advances the integration of causal inference structures and machine learning architectures, providing reliable methodologies for addressing challenges in social science policy analysis and intervention evaluations.

Abstract: Causal inference in observational panel data has become a central concern in
economics,policy analysis,and the broader social sciences.To address the core
contradiction where traditional difference-in-differences (DID) struggles with
high-dimensional confounding variables in observational panel data,while
machine learning (ML) lacks causal structure interpretability,this paper
proposes an innovative framework called S-DIDML that integrates structural
identification with high-dimensional estimation.Building upon the structure of
traditional DID methods,S-DIDML employs structured residual orthogonalization
techniques (Neyman orthogonality+cross-fitting) to retain the group-time
treatment effect (ATT) identification structure while resolving
high-dimensional covariate interference issues.It designs a dynamic
heterogeneity estimation module combining causal forests and semi-parametric
models to capture spatiotemporal heterogeneity effects.The framework
establishes a complete modular application process with standardized Stata
implementation paths.The introduction of S-DIDML enriches methodological
research on DID and DDML innovations, shifting causal inference from method
stacking to architecture integration.This advancement enables social sciences
to precisely identify policy-sensitive groups and optimize resource
allocation.The framework provides replicable evaluation tools, decision
optimization references,and methodological paradigms for complex intervention
scenarios such as digital transformation policies and environmental
regulations.

*Minglei Yang,Yanfang Liu,Diego del-Castillo-Negrete,Yanzhao Cao,Guannan Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid machine learning model for simulating stochastic dynamics within bounded domains, addressing challenges of particle exit modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to accurately model the exit dynamics of particles in stochastic differential equations within bounded domains.

Method: Combines a neural network with binary cross-entropy loss for learning exit probabilities and a training-free diffusion model for non-exiting particle state transitions.

Result: Performance verified through three test scenarios: 1D theoretical, 2D advection-diffusion, and 3D magnetically confined fusion plasma.

Conclusion: The hybrid ML model effectively addresses interior dynamics and exit phenomena of particles in bounded domains, improving simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Simulating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in bounded domains,
presents significant computational challenges due to particle exit phenomena,
which requires accurate modeling of interior stochastic dynamics and boundary
interactions. Despite the success of machine learning-based methods in learning
SDEs, existing learning methods are not applicable to SDEs in bounded domains
because they cannot accurately capture the particle exit dynamics. We present a
unified hybrid data-driven approach that combines a conditional diffusion model
with an exit prediction neural network to capture both interior stochastic
dynamics and boundary exit phenomena. Our ML model consists of two major
components: a neural network that learns exit probabilities using binary
cross-entropy loss with rigorous convergence guarantees, and a training-free
diffusion model that generates state transitions for non-exiting particles
using closed-form score functions. The two components are integrated through a
probabilistic sampling algorithm that determines particle exit at each time
step and generates appropriate state transitions. The performance of the
proposed approach is demonstrated via three test cases: a one-dimensional
simplified problem for theoretical verification, a two-dimensional
advection-diffusion problem in a bounded domain, and a three-dimensional
problem of interest to magnetically confined fusion plasmas.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel algorithm for off-policy evaluation using conformal prediction to enhance reliability in contextual bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage for safety-critical applications in off-policy evaluation.

Method: The method strengthens the PAC-valid conformal prediction framework by providing PAC-type bounds for coverage and evaluates both finite-sample and asymptotic properties.

Result: Empirical simulations demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed methodology compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The study advances off-policy evaluation by improving theoretical guarantees and empirical reliability, notably for contextual bandit problems.

Abstract: This paper investigates off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, aiming
to quantify the performance of a target policy using data collected under a
different and potentially unknown behavior policy. Recently, methods based on
conformal prediction have been developed to construct reliable prediction
intervals that guarantee marginal coverage in finite samples, making them
particularly suited for safety-critical applications. To further achieve
coverage conditional on a given offline data set, we propose a novel algorithm
that constructs probably approximately correct prediction intervals. Our method
builds upon a PAC-valid conformal prediction framework, and we strengthen its
theoretical guarantees by establishing PAC-type bounds on coverage. We analyze
both finite-sample and asymptotic properties of the proposed method, and
compare its empirical performance with existing methods in simulations.

### [292] [Estimating Treatment Effects with Independent Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16467)

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper establishes a connection between Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and causal effect estimation in partially linear regression (PLR) models, revealing ICA’s capabilities to estimate treatment effects under complex conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between causal inference and identifiability theory, specifically examining how Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can improve causal effect estimation in the partially linear regression (PLR) setting.

Method: The researchers analyze theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate the applicability of ICA within PLR models, focusing on scenarios with non-Gaussian treatment noise, Gaussian confounders, and nonlinear nuisances.

Result: The study reveals that ICA can effectively estimate multiple treatment effects even in challenging settings, such as when Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisances exist.

Conclusion: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) offers a robust tool for enhancing causal estimation in PLR models, underscoring the synergy between identifiability theory and causal inference methodologies.

Abstract: The field of causal inference has developed a variety of methods to
accurately estimate treatment effects in the presence of nuisance. Meanwhile,
the field of identifiability theory has developed methods like Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) to identify latent sources and mixing weights from
data. While these two research communities have developed largely
independently, they aim to achieve similar goals: the accurate and
sample-efficient estimation of model parameters. In the partially linear
regression (PLR) setting, Mackey et al. (2018) recently found that estimation
consistency can be improved with non-Gaussian treatment noise. Non-Gaussianity
is also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide
the first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that
ICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model. Surprisingly, we
find that linear ICA can accurately estimate multiple treatment effects even in
the presence of Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (RLDA) in high-dimensional classification, addresses its limitations, and introduces the Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RLDA's inconsistent performance in high-dimensional scenarios and understand how data structures impact classification outcomes.

Method: The authors propose SEDA, a new algorithm based on adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix and deriving theoretical results using random matrix theory.

Result: SEDA shows superior accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to existing LDA methods in tests across both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: SEDA provides an effective enhancement to the performance of RLDA in high-dimensional data settings, offering both theoretical insights and practical benefits.

Abstract: Regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is a widely used tool for
classification and dimensionality reduction, but its performance in
high-dimensional scenarios is inconsistent. Existing theoretical analyses of
RLDA often lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification
performance. To address this issue, we derive a non-asymptotic approximation of
the misclassification rate and thus analyze the structural effect and
structural adjustment strategies of RLDA. Based on this, we propose the
Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm, which optimizes the
data structure by adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance
matrix. By developing a new theoretical result on eigenvectors in random matrix
theory, we derive an asymptotic approximation on the misclassification rate of
SEDA. The bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy are then
obtained. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that SEDA achieves
higher classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to
existing LDA methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "Dream, Lift, Animate" framework, which creates realistic, animatable 3D human avatars from a single image using video diffusion models and innovative UV-space Gaussian mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of reconstructing high-fidelity, animatable 3D human avatars from a single image, bridging the gap between unstructured 3D representations and detailed animations.

Method: The framework, DLA, incorporates multi-view image generation with video diffusion models, lifts them into 3D Gaussian representations, and aligns them in pose-aware UV space using a transformer-based encoder. The resulting avatars are animated by applying body-driven deformations and rendered in real-time.

Result: The DLA framework achieves better perceptual quality and photometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated on the ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets.

Conclusion: DLA offers a robust solution for creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars, combining strengths from generative diffusion models and pose-aware Gaussian mapping. It supports real-time rendering and intuitive editing with superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce Dream, Lift, Animate (DLA), a novel framework that reconstructs
animatable 3D human avatars from a single image. This is achieved by leveraging
multi-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of
3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a
video diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These
views are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we
propose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships
and projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned
with the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into
UV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and
rendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV
manifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine
visual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without
requiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
on ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric
accuracy. By combining the generative strengths of video diffusion models with
a pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA bridges the gap between
unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent monitoring challenges in dynamic and uncertain environments for applications like disaster response and wildlife conservation.

Method: COMPASS uses a shared spatio-temporal attention network, Gaussian Processes for modeling target dynamics, and decentralized decision-making based on centralized value training under adaptive rewards.

Result: Experiments reveal that COMPASS outperforms baseline methods in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency for multi-target scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed COMPASS framework offers an effective and scalable solution for persistent target monitoring, demonstrating significant improvements in multi-agent coordination and dynamic scenario adaptability.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world
applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife
conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under
uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple
moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes
represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing
agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as
needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared
spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical
observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian
Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable
uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation
and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong
baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination
efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.

Result: The proposed approach enables accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations by combining physical modeling with GNN's capability to handle complex correlations.

Conclusion: The integration of iterative reconstruction frameworks with GNNs enhances the accuracy and interpretability of tissue conductivity imaging in mfEIT applications.

Abstract: Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography (mfEIT) represents a
promising biomedical imaging modality that enables the estimation of tissue
conductivities across a range of frequencies. Addressing this challenge, we
present a novel variational network, a model-based learning paradigm that
strategically merges the advantages and interpretability of classical iterative
reconstruction with the power of deep learning. This approach integrates graph
neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton
(PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration
corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear
model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency
correlations. Notably, the GNN architecture preserves the irregular triangular
mesh structure used in the solution of the nonlinear forward model, enabling
accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations.

regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in
shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets
solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense motion estimation in cardiac CT imaging is crucial but limited by the difficulty of obtaining vast amounts of annotated ground-truth motion data.

Method: The approach synthesizes pairs of cardiac CT frames and 3D flow field annotations using a CVAE with a multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism. Generated flow fields apply deformations to simulate realistic cardiac motion.

Result: The authors create a fully annotated synthetic dataset that enables the training and validation of myocardium motion models without needing extensive manual annotations.

Conclusion: This innovation could significantly reduce dependence on manual labeling, facilitating improved development of accurate myocardium motion models.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is
critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven
methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they
rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion
annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation,
we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of
cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which
incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained
to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the
generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that
simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These
pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT
annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and
validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for
substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.

Conclusion: MLRU++ provides a practical, high-performing, and computationally efficient solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging
due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric
data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art
results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a
Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance

innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that
enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale
Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via
multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available
benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that
MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of
87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing
leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and
ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and
computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SFNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging both spatial and frequency domain information for 3D MRI-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, achieving 95.1% accuracy in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Alzheimer's diagnosis methods frequently analyze features from either the spatial or frequency domain in MRI data, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complexity of the disease and often restricting studies to 2D MRI. The authors aim to address this gap and improve accuracy.

Method: The authors developed SFNet, an end-to-end deep learning framework combining enhanced dense convolutional networks for extracting spatial features and a global frequency module for capturing frequency domain representations. This is coupled with a novel multi-scale attention module for refined spatial feature extraction.

Result: SFNet demonstrated superior performance, achieving 95.1% accuracy in differentiating cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease on the ANDI dataset, while also reducing computational overhead compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: By leveraging dual-domain analysis and introducing innovative modules for spatial and frequency features, SFNet sets a new benchmark for 3D MRI-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is
essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial
and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain
and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most
existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting
their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the
disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,
they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain
analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework
that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to
enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense
convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency
module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a
novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial
feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines
and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and
AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse scattering problems often require deep learning methods that heavily depend on data and face restrictions in generalization.

Method: The study proposes a PDNN trained using scattered field input and updates iteratively while optimizing hyperparameters based on constraints from scattered fields and scatterer information.

Result: The approach improves reconstruction accuracy and stability, validated by numerical and experimental results, including composite lossy scatterers.

Conclusion: The PDNN-based method is efficient, circumvents generalization issues, and achieves stable and accurate imaging.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been proposed for solving
inverse scattering problems (ISPs), but most of them heavily rely on data and
suffer from limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, a new solving
scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the
updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of
which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the
constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about
scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only
requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of
scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the
generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the
subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy
and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-OSCC, a histopathology image dataset for OSCC with both diagnostic and prognostic information, achieving high AUC results while highlighting challenges with multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSCC datasets lack comprehensive diagnostic and prognostic information, limiting the development of robust deep learning models.

Method: A new dataset of 1,325 OSCC patients is presented, evaluated using visual encoders, multi-image fusion techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks.

Result: Top-performing models achieve AUC results above 70%, with stain normalization showing mixed effects and multi-task learning presenting challenges.

Conclusion: The Multi-OSCC dataset enhances OSCC research by providing robust resources, though trade-offs in multi-task learning require attention.

Abstract: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy
where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance
clinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often
suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic
or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and
generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new
histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both
diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each
patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at
x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the
core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six
critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis
(LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE),
and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically
evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion
techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our
analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve
excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and
81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization
benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3)
Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to
single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of
balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we
publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at
https://github.com/guanjinquan/OSCC-PathologyImageDataset.

TL;DR: This paper enhances preoperative planning for TAVR surgery using semantic segmentation models to identify anatomical structures in CT scans, introducing pseudo-labels and achieving performance improvements via loss function adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving preoperative planning for TAVR surgeries through AI methods by enabling measurement of anatomical structures in CT scans.

Method: The authors created fine-grained pseudo-labels derived from coarse anatomical data, trained segmentation models, and optimized the models’ loss function to improve accuracy.

Result: The refined loss function resulted in a +1.27% Dice score increase for the segmentation models.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance segmentation model performance and provide publicly available pseudo-labels and CT scan data for TAVR-related anatomical structures.

Abstract: When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical
images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during
assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative
planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify
tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making
relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We
first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained
anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how
well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we
propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation
models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our
fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we
build upon are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16274176.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHMDiff, a novel hierarchical diffusion model for medical image synthesis that excels in quality and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of missing imaging modalities in clinical workflows due to various factors like scan corruption and patient-related issues.

Method: Develop the PHMDiff network leveraging a Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model with multi-scale masking and a Transformer-based approach for cross-granularity regularization.

Result: Experiments show PHMDiff outperforms in metrics like PSNR and SSIM, producing high-quality synthesized medical images.

Conclusion: PHMDiff demonstrates enhanced structural integrity and synthesis performance, setting a benchmark in medical image generation, with its source code publicly available.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale
image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows
significant advantages over other methods. The source code is available at

*Aiden Ochoa,Xinyuan Xu,Xing Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in identifying nanoscale defects in TEM images by leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models, introducing novel evaluation metrics, and achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis, which faces challenges like complex defect structures, limited labeled data, and higher annotation errors.

Method: This study leverages transfer learning with pre-trained encoders, utilizes L2-regularization, introduces novel evaluation metrics independent of annotation accuracy, and explores deep layer fine-tuning.

Result: The approach improved the defect detection rate by 57%, showcasing robust evaluation metrics and better application in grain boundary detection for UO2 TEM images.

Conclusion: Transfer learning is highly effective for TEM image defect detection, with deep fine-tuning and novel metrics ensuring a more accurate and reliable performance assessment.

Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated
approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional
photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due
to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These
challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of
annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning
model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we
examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for
natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,
semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable
cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement
cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which
can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we
introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation
accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we
found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,
which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset
used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only
achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation in TEM imaging, which improves accuracy in detecting small, ambiguous features by reconceptualizing the task as change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional deep learning segmentation methods due to challenges such as lack of labeled data, visually ambiguous features, and small-object detection issues within high-precision TEM imaging.

Method: Introduced MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN) using a Siamese network architecture with a U-Net backbone, paired images for change detection, and a multi-task learning strategy to analyze correlations between physical features.

Result: MTDN demonstrated a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional models in predicting small and visually ambiguous features, specifically validated in in-situ environmental TEM videos of carbon gasification.

Conclusion: The proposed MTDN method bridges the gap between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis, enabling more precise and automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental settings.

Abstract: Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a
tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions
requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically
evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic
segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data,
visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning
architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change
detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net
backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively
utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN
utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between
physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ
environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN
demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models,
particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN
achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models
in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges
several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis,
advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental
settings.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SVAgent, a novel automatic SystemVerilog assertion (SVA) generation framework, aiming to enhance vulnerability detection in integrated circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) are inefficient and struggle to handle modern security challenges in complex integrated circuits.

Method: The authors developed SVAgent, which uses a requirement decomposition mechanism to break down complex requirements into structured, solvable fine-grained problems.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that SVAgent improves accuracy and consistency of generated SVAs, outperforming existing frameworks, and was successfully integrated into mainstream vulnerability assessment environments.

Conclusion: SVAgent proves to be a practical and reliable tool for improving SVA generation in modern integrated circuit design, addressing critical inefficiencies and limitations.

Abstract: Verification using SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) is one of the most popular
methods for detecting circuit design vulnerabilities. However, with the
globalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of
security requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations.
It is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal
with the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex
integrated circuits. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an
innovative SVA automatic generation framework SVAgent. SVAgent introduces a
requirement decomposition mechanism to transform the original complex
requirements into a structured, gradually solvable fine-grained problem-solving
chain. Experiments have shown that SVAgent can effectively suppress the
influence of hallucinations and random answers, and the key evaluation
indicators such as the accuracy and consistency of the SVA are significantly
better than existing frameworks. More importantly, we successfully integrated
SVAgent into the most mainstream integrated circuit vulnerability assessment
framework and verified its practicality and reliability in a real engineering
design environment.

*Baofu Han,Bing Li,Yining Qi,Raja Jurdak,Kaibin Huang,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DP2Guard is a novel, lightweight framework for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) that enhances both privacy and robustness while reducing computational and communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) methods are limited by their reliance on heavy encryption techniques, causing excessive overhead, and by ineffective single-strategy defense mechanisms against adaptive adversaries.

Method: The authors propose DP2Guard, which integrates a lightweight gradient masking mechanism for privacy and a hybrid defense strategy using gradient feature extraction and clustering. It also incorporates trust scores for adaptive client aggregation and a blockchain for tamper-proof records.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets showed that DP2Guard successfully defended against four advanced poisoning attacks, maintained privacy, and reduced computational and communication costs compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: DP2Guard offers an effective and efficient solution for secure and robust federated learning, addressing major challenges in overhead and adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) has emerged as a secure
distributed Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that aggregates locally trained
gradients without exposing raw data. To defend against model poisoning threats,
several robustness-enhanced PPFL schemes have been proposed by integrating
anomaly detection. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: (1) the
reliance on heavyweight encryption techniques results in substantial
communication and computation overhead; and (2) single-strategy defense
mechanisms often fail to provide sufficient robustness against adaptive
adversaries. To overcome these challenges, we propose DP2Guard, a lightweight
PPFL framework that enhances both privacy and robustness. DP2Guard leverages a
lightweight gradient masking mechanism to replace costly cryptographic
operations while ensuring the privacy of local gradients. A hybrid defense
strategy is proposed, which extracts gradient features using singular value
decomposition and cosine similarity, and applies a clustering algorithm to
effectively identify malicious gradients. Additionally, DP2Guard adopts a trust
score-based adaptive aggregation scheme that adjusts client weights according
to historical behavior, while blockchain records aggregated results and trust
scores to ensure tamper-proof and auditable training. Extensive experiments
conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that DP2Guard effectively defends
against four advanced poisoning attacks while ensuring privacy with reduced
communication and computation costs.

TL;DR: Broken Access Control (BAC) vulnerabilities are critical in web applications but are difficult to detect due to challenges in automated testing. BACFuzz, a gray-box fuzzing framework, effectively identifies these vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BAC remains a critical yet underexplored area in automated testing due to challenges in reliably detecting and addressing vulnerabilities.

Method: BACFuzz combines LLM-guided parameter selection, runtime feedback, and SQL-based oracle checking, along with lightweight instrumentation for runtime analysis and backend SQL query verification.

Result: BACFuzz successfully detected 16 out of 17 known BAC vulnerabilities and discovered 26 previously unknown issues in real-world applications with low false positives.

Conclusion: BACFuzz represents a significant advancement in detecting BAC vulnerabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness and broad applicability in ensuring web application security.

Abstract: Broken Access Control (BAC) remains one of the most critical and widespread
vulnerabilities in web applications, allowing attackers to access unauthorized
resources or perform privileged actions. Despite its severity, BAC is
underexplored in automated testing due to key challenges: the lack of reliable
oracles and the difficulty of generating semantically valid attack requests. We
introduce BACFuzz, the first gray-box fuzzing framework specifically designed
to uncover BAC vulnerabilities, including Broken Object-Level Authorization
(BOLA) and Broken Function-Level Authorization (BFLA) in PHP-based web
applications. BACFuzz combines LLM-guided parameter selection with runtime
feedback and SQL-based oracle checking to detect silent authorization flaws. It
employs lightweight instrumentation to capture runtime information that guides
test generation, and analyzes backend SQL queries to verify whether
unauthorized inputs flow into protected operations. Evaluated on 20 real-world
web applications, including 15 CVE cases and 2 known benchmarks, BACFuzz
detects 16 of 17 known issues and uncovers 26 previously unknown BAC
vulnerabilities with low false positive rates. All identified issues have been
responsibly disclosed, and artifacts will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvChar, a black-box attack method targeting interpretable NLP systems by making minimal character-level changes to fool classifiers without altering semantic meaning significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the vulnerability of interpretable natural language processing systems to adversarial examples while maintaining semantic meaning and interpretation similarity.

Method: AdvChar modifies text inputs minimally at the character level, using an interpretation-focused scoring approach to identify critical tokens, thereby misleading deep learning classifiers while preserving the original interpretation.

Result: AdvChar was tested on seven NLP models and three interpretation models across benchmark datasets, achieving significant accuracy reduction with just two character changes on average per input.

Conclusion: AdvChar highlights the susceptibility of interpretable NLP models to adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for robust defenses in system design.

Abstract: Studies have shown that machine learning systems are vulnerable to
adversarial examples in theory and practice. Where previous attacks have
focused mainly on visual models that exploit the difference between human and
machine perception, text-based models have also fallen victim to these attacks.
However, these attacks often fail to maintain the semantic meaning of the text
and similarity. This paper introduces AdvChar, a black-box attack on
Interpretable Natural Language Processing Systems, designed to mislead the
classifier while keeping the interpretation similar to benign inputs, thus
exploiting trust in system transparency. AdvChar achieves this by making less
noticeable modifications to text input, forcing the deep learning classifier to
make incorrect predictions and preserve the original interpretation. We use an
interpretation-focused scoring approach to determine the most critical tokens
that, when changed, can cause the classifier to misclassify the input. We apply
simple character-level modifications to measure the importance of tokens,
minimizing the difference between the original and new text while generating
adversarial interpretations similar to benign ones. We thoroughly evaluated
AdvChar by testing it against seven NLP models and three interpretation models
using benchmark datasets for the classification task. Our experiments show that
AdvChar can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of current deep
learning models by altering just two characters on average in input samples.

*Boheng Li,Junjie Wang,Yiming Li,Zhiyang Hu,Leyi Qi,Jianshuo Dong,Run Wang,Han Qiu,Zhan Qin,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes DREAM, a scalable framework for identifying problematic prompts in text-to-image models by modeling the distribution of such prompts, surpassing existing methods in effectiveness and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models remain vulnerable to producing harmful content, despite safety measures, raising concerns about exposure and misuse. Proactive methods like red teaming are essential to identify risky prompts before deployment.

Method: The method introduces DREAM, which directly models the probabilistic distribution of problematic prompts instead of optimizing them individually. It uses energy-based reformulation and a novel GC-SPSA optimization algorithm to ensure effectiveness and scalability without requiring training samples.

Result: DREAM's performance was evaluated against nine baselines in diverse scenarios, proving superior in prompt discovery success rate and diversity across various text-to-image models and safety filters.

Conclusion: DREAM presents a significant improvement over existing red teaming approaches for testing T2I systems, enabling better scalability, diversity, and safety assessment prior to deployment.

Abstract: Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,
text-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing
harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious
concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which
aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs
from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential
external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly
recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before
real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often
treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which
limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to
automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.
Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly
models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic
prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and
diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve
this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw
inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple
and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient
optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long
and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is
validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9
state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I
models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: eX-NIDS enhances the interpretability of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) using Large Language Models (LLMs). It improves explanation quality by integrating enriched contextual data into input prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of interpretability in flow-based NIDS and aims to provide detailed and accurate explanations for malicious flow detections.

Method: The framework, eX-NIDS, uses a Prompt Augmenter module to extract contextual information and CTI knowledge from identified flows, enriching LLM input prompts to generate improved explanations. Llama 3 and GPT-4 models were used for evaluation.

Result: Augmented LLMs produce significantly more accurate and consistent explanations than a Basic-Prompt Explainer, with over a 20% improvement.

Conclusion: Integrating contextual data into LLM prompts can serve as a valuable complementary tool to increase interpretability in NIDS, improving explanation quality and aiding cybersecurity operations.

Abstract: This paper introduces eX-NIDS, a framework designed to enhance
interpretability in flow-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). In our proposed framework, flows
labelled as malicious by NIDS are initially processed through a module called
the Prompt Augmenter. This module extracts contextual information and Cyber
Threat Intelligence (CTI)-related knowledge from these flows. This enriched,
context-specific data is then integrated with an input prompt for an LLM,
enabling it to generate detailed explanations and interpretations of why the
flow was identified as malicious by NIDS. We compare the generated
interpretations against a Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline, which does not
incorporate any contextual information into the LLM's input prompt. Our
framework is quantitatively evaluated using the Llama 3 and GPT-4 models,
employing a novel evaluation method tailored for natural language explanations,
focusing on their correctness and consistency. The results demonstrate that
augmented LLMs can produce accurate and consistent explanations, serving as
valuable complementary tools in NIDS to explain the classification of malicious
flows. The use of augmented prompts enhances performance by over 20% compared
to the Basic-Prompt Explainer.

*Tian Dong,Yan Meng,Shaofeng Li,Guoxing Chen,Zhen Liu,Haojin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores inversion attacks on the internal states of LLMs, proving that inputs can be reconstructed more effectively than previously assumed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and safety concerns associated with exposing internal states (ISs) of LLMs during practices like collaborative inference and model auditing.

Method: Four inversion attacks are proposed, including optimization-based white-box attacks, black-box attacks leveraging transferability, and a generation-based attack treating the task as translation.

Result: Proposed methods successfully reconstruct inputs with high semantic and token-level similarity, including nearly perfect inversion of a 4,112-token medical prompt with an 86.88 F1 token matching rate.

Conclusion: Current defenses are insufficient against ISs inversion attacks, emphasizing the need for more robust mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines,
yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research
proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to
ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner
neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which
are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization
challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this
work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that
significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of
inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box
optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These
attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,
through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack
under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability
between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a
generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing
an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and
long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs
validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token
long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1
token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate
four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion
and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.

Motivation: Existing emotion recognition methods oversimplify temporal and spatial data, limiting accuracy and efficiency for real-time applications.

Method: MSGM uses multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling, and efficient fusion with the Mamba architecture and token embedding module.

Result: The proposed MSGM framework surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy in emotion recognition across multiple datasets and offers robust, millisecond-level inference.

Conclusion: MSGM effectively captures multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics, enhancing EEG-based emotion recognition while being computationally efficient for real-time use.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale

spatial hierarchies, limiting accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we
propose the Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel framework
integrating multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling,
and efficient fusion via the Mamba architecture. By segmenting EEG signals
across diverse temporal scales and constructing global-local graphs with
neuroanatomical priors, MSGM effectively captures fine-grained emotional
fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity. A multi-depth Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) and token embedding fusion module, paired with
Mamba's state-space modeling, enable dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at
linear complexity. Notably, with just one MSST-Mamba layer, MSGM surpasses
leading methods in the field on the SEED, THU-EP, and FACED datasets,
outperforming baselines in subject-independent emotion classification while
achieving robust accuracy and millisecond-level inference on the NVIDIA Jetson
Xavier NX.

### [318] [Bayesian implementation of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for uncertainty quantification in causal effect estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15909)
*Saideep Nannapaneni,Joseph Sakaya,Kyle Caron,Pedro HM Albuquerque,Zaid Tashman*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces three Bayesian approaches of the TMLE algorithm to provide a probabilistic understanding of causal effects under uncertainty, focusing on binary treatments and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robust decision-making by improving the estimation of causal effects under uncertainty using Bayesian methods.

Method: The authors propose three Bayesian implementations of the TMLE algorithm: two with sequentially trained models (using varying probabilistic predictions) and one with a simultaneous training approach via a Bayesian network (BN-TMLE).

Result: The BN-TMLE method outperformed classical TMLE in small data regimes and achieved similar performance in large data regimes, demonstrating robustness against data size and model misspecifications.

Conclusion: Bayesian TMLE, particularly BN-TMLE, presents a promising tool for robust causal effect estimation, especially in scenarios with limited data or uncertain model specifications.

Abstract: Robust decision making involves making decisions in the presence of
uncertainty and is often used in critical domains such as healthcare, supply
chains, and finance. Causality plays a crucial role in decision-making as it
predicts the change in an outcome (usually a key performance indicator) due to
a treatment (also called an intervention). To facilitate robust decision making
using causality, this paper proposes three Bayesian approaches of the popular
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) algorithm, a flexible
semi-parametric double robust estimator, for a probabilistic quantification of
uncertainty in causal effects with binary treatment, and binary and continuous
outcomes. In the first two approaches, the three TMLE models (outcome,
treatment, and fluctuation) are trained sequentially. Since Bayesian
implementation of treatment and outcome yields probabilistic predictions, the
first approach uses mean predictions, while the second approach uses both the
mean and standard deviation of predictions for training the fluctuation model
(targeting step). The third approach trains all three models simultaneously
through a Bayesian network (called BN-TMLE in this paper). The proposed
approaches were demonstrated for two examples with binary and continuous
outcomes and validated against classical implementations. This paper also
investigated the effect of data sizes and model misspecifications on causal
effect estimation using the BN-TMLE approach. Results showed that the proposed
BN-TMLE outperformed classical implementations in small data regimes and
performed similarly in large data regimes.

### [319] [Bootstrapped Control Limits for Score-Based Concept Drift Control Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16749)
*Jiezhong Wu,Daniel W. Apley*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new bootstrap procedure to enhance the accuracy of concept drift detection while improving false-alarm rate control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current concept drift detection techniques, particularly inaccurate control of false-alarm rates and reduced training set efficacy.

Method: Developed a novel bootstrap procedure, incorporating a 632-like correction to better account for variability in concept drift detection.

Result: The proposed bootstrap control limit improves false-alarm rate control, utilizes the entire initial sample for training, and achieves superior accuracy for fitted models.

Conclusion: The new approach refines concept drift detection metrics while ensuring robustness and accuracy in monitoring predictive relationships.

Abstract: Monitoring for changes in a predictive relationship represented by a fitted
supervised learning model (aka concept drift detection) is a widespread
problem, e.g., for retrospective analysis to determine whether the predictive
relationship was stable over the training data, for prospective analysis to
determine when it is time to update the predictive model, for quality control
of processes whose behavior can be characterized by a predictive relationship,
etc. A general and powerful Fisher score-based concept drift approach has
recently been proposed, in which concept drift detection reduces to detecting
changes in the mean of the model's score vector using a multivariate
exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA). To implement the approach, the
initial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the
training sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an
out-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined.
In this paper, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for computing the CL. Our
bootstrap CL provides much more accurate control of false-alarm rate,
especially when the sample size and/or false-alarm rate is small. It also
allows the entire initial sample to be used for training, resulting in a more
accurate fitted supervised learning model. We show that a standard nested
bootstrap (inner loop accounting for future data variability and outer loop
accounting for training sample variability) substantially underestimates
variability and develop a 632-like correction that appropriately accounts for
this. We demonstrate the advantages with numerical examples.

### [320] [Recursive Equations For Imputation Of Missing Not At Random Data With Sparse Pattern Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16107)
*Trung Phung,Kyle Reese,Ilya Shpitser,Rohit Bhattacharya*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for handling missing data using the MISPR algorithm, which is effective under both MAR and MNAR settings and avoids traditional biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling missing data assume MAR and impose unrealistic assumptions, leading to biases in post-analysis.

Method: The authors propose a constructive characterization of full data laws in graphical models and introduce the MISPR algorithm using Gibbs sampling.

Result: Simulations show that MISPR performs comparably to MICE for MAR and significantly better for MNAR scenarios.

Conclusion: MISPR provides a more principled and practical approach for missing data analysis, addressing patterns with no data support without imposing extra assumptions beyond the model.

Abstract: A common approach for handling missing values in data analysis pipelines is
multiple imputation via software packages such as MICE (Van Buuren and
Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) and Amelia (Honaker et al., 2011). These packages
typically assume the data are missing at random (MAR), and impose parametric or
smoothing assumptions upon the imputing distributions in a way that allows
imputation to proceed even if not all missingness patterns have support in the
data. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and induce model
misspecification bias on any analysis performed after such imputation.
  In this paper, we provide a principled alternative. Specifically, we develop
a new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing
data. This characterization is constructive, is easily adapted for the
calculation of imputation distributions for both MAR and MNAR (missing not at
random) mechanisms, and is able to handle lack of support for certain patterns
of missingness. We use this characterization to develop a new imputation
algorithm -- Multivariate Imputation via Supported Pattern Recursion (MISPR) --
which uses Gibbs sampling, by analogy with the Multivariate Imputation with
Chained Equations (MICE) algorithm, but which is consistent under both MAR and
MNAR settings, and is able to handle missing data patterns with no support
without imposing additional assumptions beyond those already imposed by the
missing data model itself.
  In simulations, we show MISPR obtains comparable results to MICE when data
are MAR, and superior, less biased results when data are MNAR. Our
characterization and imputation algorithm based on it are a step towards making
principled missing data methods more practical in applied settings, where the
data are likely both MNAR and sufficiently high dimensional to yield missing
data patterns with no support at available sample sizes.

*Qingliang Fan,Ruike Wu,Yanrong Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-adaptive multi-task learning framework to improve estimation of multi-sector portfolio factor models using projection-penalized principal component analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing model estimation and information transfer across multiple asset classes in multi-sector portfolio optimization is complex and critically important.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-task learning method to quantify inter-sector relatedness in factor modeling and develops a projection-penalized principal component analysis algorithm for its implementation.

Result: Simulation studies and analysis of daily returns from the Russell 3000 index confirm the superiority of the proposed method in factor model estimation and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves multi-sector portfolio optimization by leveraging inter-sector relatedness, offering both theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: Accurate transfer of information across multiple sectors to enhance model
estimation is both significant and challenging in multi-sector portfolio
optimization involving a large number of assets in different classes. Within
the framework of factor modeling, we propose a novel data-adaptive multi-task
learning methodology that quantifies and learns the relatedness among the
principal temporal subspaces (spanned by factors) across multiple sectors under
study. This approach not only improves the simultaneous estimation of multiple
factor models but also enhances multi-sector portfolio optimization, which
heavily depends on the accurate recovery of these factor models. Additionally,
a novel and easy-to-implement algorithm, termed projection-penalized principal
component analysis, is developed to accomplish the multi-task learning
procedure. Diverse simulation designs and practical application on daily return
data from Russell 3000 index demonstrate the advantages of multi-task learning
methodology.

*Aayush Rajesh,Nikhil Karamchandani,Vinod M. Prabhakaran*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper addresses distributed computation despite Byzantine worker failures by using replication and limited local computation, proposing optimized protocols for computation and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to manage distributed computation tasks in the presence of Byzantine errors while minimizing expensive local computations at the central node.

Method: The researchers introduced a protocol for balanced job allocation that minimizes local computation and later modified it to improve communication efficiency.

Result: They presented closed-form performance results for cyclic allocations and demonstrated improved communication efficiency without increasing local computation.

Conclusion: The study provides an optimized approach to distributed computation, balancing computation and communication under Byzantine worker challenges.

Abstract: We study a distributed computation problem in the presence of Byzantine
workers where a central node wishes to solve a task that is divided into
independent sub-tasks, each of which needs to be solved correctly. The
distributed computation is achieved by allocating the sub-task computation
across workers with replication, as well as solving a small number of sub-tasks
locally, which we wish to minimize due to it being expensive. For a general
balanced job allocation, we propose a protocol that successfully solves for all
sub-tasks using an optimal number of local computations under no communication
constraints. Closed-form performance results are presented for cyclic
allocations. Furthermore, we propose a modification to this protocol to improve
communication efficiency without compromising on the amount of local
computation.

*Peng Chen,Hailiang Zhao,Jiaji Zhang,Xueyan Tang,Yixuan Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guard, a lightweight framework that improves the robustness of learning-augmented caching algorithms while maintaining their ideal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of robustness guarantees in naive learning-augmented caching algorithms without sacrificing $1$-consistency or introducing high computational overhead.

Method: Guard is proposed as a robustification framework that provides robustness up to $2H_k + 2$ for a class of learning-augmented caching algorithms, while preserving $1$-consistency with only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional per-request overhead.

Result: Guard achieves the best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness and maintains the original time complexity of the base algorithm.

Conclusion: The framework is effective both theoretically and in practice, as demonstrated through experiments across real-world datasets and prediction models.

Abstract: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a
sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented
caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness
guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency
or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
\textsc{Guard}, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the
robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k +
2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. \textsc{Guard} achieves the current
best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the
original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across
multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness
of \textsc{Guard} in practice.

*Sharareh Alipour,Arash Ahadi,Kajal Baghestani*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper improves upper bounds for activating sleeping robots in geometric spaces under specific norms, reducing makespan and optimizing the wake-up ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the time required to activate a set of robots initially asleep in geometric spaces, aiming to optimize the wake-up ratio for improved operational strategies.

Method: Utilized geometric analysis in Euclidean spaces ($\mathbb{R}^d$) with $\ell_p$ norms to derive new strategies and bounds for activating robots more efficiently.

Result: Achieved a better upper bound for wake-up ratio in $(\mathbb{R}^2, \ell_2)$ from 4.62 to 4.31, and in $(\mathbb{R}^3)$, improved ratios for both $(\ell_1)$ and $(\ell_2)$ norms, outperforming previous strategies.

Conclusion: The study advances the field of robot activation strategies through tighter bounds, indicating significant improvements for geometric FTP under $\ell_p$ norms.

Abstract: The Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) involves activating a set of initially asleep
robots as quickly as possible, starting from a single awake robot. Once
activated, a robot can assist in waking up other robots. Each active robot
moves at unit speed. The objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the time
required to activate the last robot. A key performance measure is the wake-up
ratio, defined as the maximum time needed to activate any number of robots in
any primary positions. This work focuses on the geometric (Euclidean) version
of FTP in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $\ell_p$ norm, where the initial distance
between each asleep robot and the single active robot is at most 1. For
$(\mathbb{R}^2, \ell_2)$, we improve the previous upper bound of 4.62 ([7],
CCCG 2024) to 4.31. Note that it is known that 3.82 is a lower bound for the
wake-up ratio. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, we propose a new strategy that achieves a
wake-up ratio of 12 for $(\mathbb{R}^3, \ell_1)$ and 12.76 for $(\mathbb{R}^3,
\ell_2)$, improving upon the previous bounds of 13 and $13\sqrt{3}$,
respectively, reported in [2].

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width Extension framework, utilizing novel discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical systems to recover high-frequency components in limited bandwidth scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve bandwidth-constrained systems by recovering high-frequency components for applications like telecommunications and audio, which are otherwise lost due to hardware and resource limitations.

Method: The method involves using multiple novel discriminators (e.g., MRLD, MS-RD, MSDFA, etc.) inspired by nonlinear dynamical systems, combined with a complex-valued ConformerNeXt-based generator architecture that incorporates both global and local temporal modeling. The model also uses depth-wise convolution to reduce parameters significantly.

Result: NDSI-BWE achieves state-of-the-art results in Band Width Extension, outperforming other methods across six objective metrics and subjective tests involving human judges.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel approach to Band Width Extension, combining innovative discriminators and efficient architectures to offer high performance with reduced parameters, marking significant advancements in the field.

Abstract: Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial
for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on
limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width
Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by
nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a
Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to
initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence
Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale
Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant
scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincar\'e Plot Discriminator
(MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period
Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude
Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for
capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise
convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators,
NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators
guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream
Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and
phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global
dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability.
Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of
five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.

TL;DR: Speaker diarization systems show varying error rates across datasets and require consistent benchmarks for comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in evaluating speaker diarization systems across diverse datasets and domains.

Method: Introduced SDBench, a benchmark suite integrating 13 datasets for reproducible and fine-grained evaluation and developed SpeakerKit to demonstrate its application.

Result: SpeakerKit achieved 9.6x speed improvement over Pyannote v3 with comparable error rates. Benchmarked 6 state-of-the-art diarization systems.

Conclusion: SDBench facilitates consistent benchmarking of diarization systems, revealing trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency across systems.

Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in
error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and
domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of
best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for
apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization
Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets
with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker
diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench
enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time.
To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference
efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid
execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than
Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6
state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI
API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

### [327] [Detect Any Sound: Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection with Multi-Modal Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16343)
*Pengfei Cai,Yan Song,Qing Gu,Nan Jiang,Haoyu Song,Ian McLoughlin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces DASM, an open-vocabulary sound event detection framework using query-based retrieval. It improves performance in localizing and generalizing to novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sound event detection methods are limited to predefined classes, and existing zero-shot SED approaches suffer from poor alignment and feature fusion.

Method: The authors propose DASM, which uses a dual-stream decoder for event recognition and temporal localization. It incorporates multi-modal queries and an attention masking strategy to enhance performance.

Result: DASM outperformed existing methods in open-vocabulary (+7.8 PSDS) and closed-set (+6.9 PSDS) settings, achieving competitive results in unseen datasets (PSDS1 score of 42.2 on DESED).

Conclusion: DASM provides a significant advancement in open-vocabulary SED by bridging existing limitations in feature alignment and generalization to novel sound classes.

Abstract: Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a
closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined
classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by
exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from
satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature
fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a
query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.
DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are
matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support
this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly
decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event
decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound
events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies
for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking
strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel
classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments
on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances
localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming
CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in
the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot
evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the
supervised CRNN baseline. The project page is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for generating multisource binaural audio from text inputs by integrating spatial and temporal control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-audio methods only produce mono audio and miss out on spatial information critical for immersive auditory experiences.

Method: The approach uses a large language model to include temporal/spatial details, generates multiple mono audios, and then converts them to binaural through a rendering network, arranging them based on timing.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing methods in audio generation quality and spatial perception accuracy.

Conclusion: The study effectively bridges the gap in immersive auditory experiences by offering high-quality, spatially accurate multisource binaural audio from text inputs.

Abstract: Most existing text-to-audio (TTA) generation methods produce mono outputs,
neglecting essential spatial information for immersive auditory experiences. To
address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource
binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control.
First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a
structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a
pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with
varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into
binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data
from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times,
resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality
and spatial perceptual accuracy.

*Felix Burt,Kuan-Cheng Chen,Kin K. Leung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of scaling quantum computers via distributed quantum computing, proposing optimized methods for quantum circuit partitioning that minimize entanglement costs and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computers face scaling challenges, especially in distributed systems, where network connectivity and efficient entanglement sharing become increasingly difficult as the system grows.

Method: The authors propose modifying existing partitioning schemes to account for network topology and entanglement costs. They also explore methods of scaling using network and problem coarsening.

Result: The proposed methods reduce entanglement costs and improve solution quality across various network topologies, with coarsened methods offering faster runtimes and better outcomes in many cases.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that their approach optimizes partitioning for distributed quantum computing networks, paving the way for more scalable quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates
investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is
achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However,
connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity
constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing
increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the
quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement
between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address
this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes
designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both
of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement
requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different
network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases
than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale
quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that
coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with
significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.

Motivation: The challenge to prepare quantum Gibbs states is fundamental in quantum computing, with applications in open quantum systems and quantum machine learning. Current methods face efficiency and scalability limitations, particularly on NISQ devices.

Method: Two meta-learning algorithms, Meta-VQT (fully quantum ansatz) and NN-Meta VQT (quantum-classical hybrid architecture), are developed. These utilize collective optimization and meta-learned parameters to generalize Gibbs state preparation efficiently to unseen cases. The methods are tested on various quantum models and applications.

Result: The methods achieve efficient thermal state preparation, outperform random initializations in larger systems, handle finite-temperature regimes effectively, and enhance Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) training with improved accuracy and significant runtime speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms advance the field of quantum Gibbs state preparation by demonstrating scalability, practicality, and enhanced performance over existing methods for applications, including QBMs and thermal state generation.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum
computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum
systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum
Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem
driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms:
Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT
(NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized
Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT
utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum
classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over
training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We
validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the
2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal
state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our
meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve
as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random
initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring
example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature
crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum
Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms,
achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a
30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum
imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and
practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces reinforcement learning-based methods to optimize variational quantum circuits' design, improving circuit ansatz for specific problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) depend heavily on circuit ansatz design, which traditionally relies on heuristic methods. This paper aims to improve ansatz creation through reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposed two methods (RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block) based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which iteratively adds gates using empirical measurements to optimize an objective function.

Result: RLVQC Block outperforms the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and RLVQC Global, achieving similar circuit depth as QAOA but consistently better results. RLVQC Global produces even shorter circuits with good performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can effectively discover tailored ansatz structures balancing rigidity and adaptability for improved problem-specific VQAs.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches
for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly
depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically
constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of
variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where
gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we
introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC
Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates
ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit
pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates
unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt
the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement
outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed
methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based
optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong
results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally
surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth
comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly
shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be
an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific
problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid
predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a
favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

### [332] [Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16004)
*Riccardo Nembrini,Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema,Paolo Cremonesi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning-based method for minor embedding in Quantum Annealing, showing adaptability and efficiency on different hardware topologies like Chimera and Zephyr.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing minor embedding methods for Quantum Annealing are computationally expensive, poorly scalable, and often tailored to specific hardware topologies. A flexible, generalizable approach is needed.

Method: The authors propose using a Reinforcement Learning technique, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to handle minor embedding as a sequential decision-making task.

Result: The RL agent successfully produces valid minor embeddings that are efficient in terms of qubit usage, especially on the Zephyr topology. It scales to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to various graph structures.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Learning demonstrates strong potential as a general-purpose and adaptable framework for minor embedding in Quantum Annealing, especially for modern hardware like Zephyr.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor
embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum
processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with
increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often
developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult
to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by
treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an
agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem
variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor
embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to
embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two
hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent
consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number
of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed
approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to
different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and
general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.

### [333] [Adaptive Bayesian Single-Shot Quantum Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16477)
*Ivana Nikoloska,Ruud Van Sloun,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian-based adaptive protocol for variational quantum sensing, tailored for non-asymptotic scenarios and supporting collaborative multi-agent setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensing achieves high precision measurements using quantum systems, but optimizing them is challenging due to classically intractable high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The authors propose employing a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) combined with Bayesian inference to dynamically adapt the sensing policy for maximizing active information gain.

Result: The method provides an adaptive approach to quantum sensing optimization, suitable for single-probe and multi-agent collaboration scenarios.

Conclusion: The introduced adaptive Bayesian protocol enhances quantum sensing strategies, especially for scenarios involving limited probes and multi-sensor fusion.

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable
precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and
electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the
limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and
measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires
optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum
sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum
channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are
typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning
criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian
inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active
information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for
non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step,
and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum
sensing agents.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper reviews the use of AI in improving UX for CAE software, highlighting gaps between academic research and industry implementations and suggesting opportunities for future studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fragmented research on integrating AI to enhance user experience in CAE software, emphasizing gaps between academic pursuits and industry practices.

Method: A multivocal literature review (MLR) was conducted to analyze both academic research and industry implementations of AI in CAE software, with a focus on UX improvements.

Result: The study identifies disparities in focus areas: industry actively implements technologies like LLMs and adaptive UIs, while academic research focuses on technical aspects without UX validation. It also presents opportunities for AI-driven guidance, interfaces, and automation.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential for AI to revolutionize the UX in CAE software and provides groundwork for bridging the gap between academic theories and practical applications in the field.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) enables simulation experts to optimize
complex models, but faces challenges in user experience (UX) that limit
efficiency and accessibility. While artificial intelligence (AI) has
demonstrated potential to enhance CAE processes, research integrating these
fields with a focus on UX remains fragmented. This paper presents a multivocal
literature review (MLR) examining how AI enhances UX in CAE software across
both academic research and industry implementations. Our analysis reveals
significant gaps between academic explorations and industry applications, with
companies actively implementing LLMs, adaptive UIs, and recommender systems
while academic research focuses primarily on technical capabilities without UX
validation. Key findings demonstrate opportunities in AI-powered guidance,
adaptive interfaces, and workflow automation that remain underexplored in
current research. By mapping the intersection of these domains, this study
provides a foundation for future work to address the identified research gaps
and advance the integration of AI to improve CAE user experience.

### [335] ["Just a strange pic": Evaluating 'safety' in GenAI Image safety annotation tasks from diverse annotators' perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16033)

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores how annotators assess the safety of AI-generated images, highlighting the complex moral, emotional, and contextual reasoning that goes beyond predefined safety taxonomies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing safety pipelines in capturing nuanced, real-world judgments of harm in AI-generated content.

Method: Analysis of 5,372 open-ended comments provided by annotators evaluating AI-generated images, focusing on qualitative reasoning and the influence of annotation guidelines.

Result: Annotators rely on moral, emotional, and sociocultural reasoning to evaluate harm, frequently citing collective risks and task guidelines as influential factors.

Conclusion: Current safety frameworks overlook critical aspects of harm reasoning. The paper advocates for more nuanced evaluation designs that incorporate moral reflection and subjective interpretation.

Abstract: Understanding what constitutes safety in AI-generated content is complex.
While developers often rely on predefined taxonomies, real-world safety
judgments also involve personal, social, and cultural perceptions of harm. This
paper examines how annotators evaluate the safety of AI-generated images,
focusing on the qualitative reasoning behind their judgments. Analyzing 5,372
open-ended comments, we find that annotators consistently invoke moral,
emotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond structured safety
categories. Many reflect on potential harm to others more than to themselves,
grounding their judgments in lived experience, collective risk, and
sociocultural awareness. Beyond individual perceptions, we also find that the
structure of the task itself -- including annotation guidelines -- shapes how
annotators interpret and express harm. Guidelines influence not only which
images are flagged, but also the moral judgment behind the justifications.
Annotators frequently cite factors such as image quality, visual distortion,
and mismatches between prompt and output as contributing to perceived harm
dimensions, which are often overlooked in standard evaluation frameworks. Our
findings reveal that existing safety pipelines miss critical forms of reasoning
that annotators bring to the task. We argue for evaluation designs that
scaffold moral reflection, differentiate types of harm, and make space for
subjective, context-sensitive interpretations of AI-generated content.

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of text-to-CT Scan generative AI models in medical domains through a human-centered approach, engaging medical professionals to assess its utility and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in AI development for medical imagery by involving medical professionals to ensure useful and safe outcomes.

Method: The researchers adopted a human-centered process engaging stakeholders like medical students and radiologists to evaluate a text-to-CT Scan generative AI model.

Result: Identified perspectives on how such AI tools can influence education, training, and practice while uncovering technical and domain-specific risks.

Conclusion: A stakeholder-driven focus is necessary to create responsible and impactful medical generative AI models.

Abstract: As text-to-image generative models rapidly improve, AI researchers are making
significant advances in developing domain-specific models capable of generating
complex medical imagery from text prompts. Despite this, these technical
advancements have overlooked whether and how medical professionals would
benefit from and use text-to-image generative AI (GenAI) in practice. By
developing domain-specific GenAI without involving stakeholders, we risk the
potential of building models that are either not useful or even more harmful
than helpful. In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible
model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the
promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through
exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical
students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan
GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This
human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges
and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images. We conclude
by reflecting on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the social acceptance of an XR training system for journalists using real-world experiments and a modified Almere model, exploring ease of use, usefulness, dependability, and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand user perceptions and improve social acceptance regarding XR agent technology in training scenarios for journalists, particularly in sensitive or dangerous contexts.

Method: A user study with controlled experiments testing a web-based XR system involving user-avatar interactions, using extended Almere model parameters for data collection.

Result: Findings revealed how users perceive the social acceptability of the XR system, suggesting positive acceptance but highlighting areas needing improvement like dependability and security.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into social acceptance of XR systems in journalism training and pinpoints improvement opportunities for user-agent interaction and system design.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the findings of a user study that evaluated the
social acceptance of eXtended Reality (XR) agent technology, focusing on a
remotely accessible, web-based XR training system developed for journalists.
This system involves user interaction with a virtual avatar, enabled by a
modular toolkit. The interactions are designed to provide tailored training for
journalists in digital-remote settings, especially for sensitive or dangerous
scenarios, without requiring specialized end-user equipment like headsets. Our
research adapts and extends the Almere model, representing social acceptance
through existing attributes such as perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness, along with added ones like dependability and security in the
user-agent interaction. The XR agent was tested through a controlled experiment
in a real-world setting, with data collected on users' perceptions. Our
findings, based on quantitative and qualitative measurements involving
questionnaires, contribute to the understanding of user perceptions and
acceptance of XR agent solutions within a specific social context, while also
identifying areas for the improvement of XR systems.

*Laura Moradbakhti,Dorian Peters,Jennifer K. Quint,Björn Schuller,Darren Cook,Rafael A. Calvo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates asthma patients' willingness to engage with mobile chatbot healthcare tools, identifying opportunities and challenges for adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asthma-related deaths in the UK are alarmingly high, and current care access is insufficient. The study aims to explore alternative methods such as chatbots for health education and support.

Method: A survey with 1257 asthma patients was devised and conducted collaboratively by asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers to assess factors influencing chatbot engagement.

Result: 53% of asthma patients showed interest in engaging with chatbots, particularly those perceiving their condition as serious or struggling with self-management. Preferences for 24/7 access, personalization, and WhatsApp usage were revealed, alongside concerns about privacy and technological trust.

Conclusion: The findings highlight both potential benefits and challenges of chatbot adoption in asthma care, offering 7 developer recommendations to maximize efficacy and engagement.

Abstract: Asthma-related deaths in the UK are the highest in Europe, and only 30% of
patients access basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to
reaching people with asthma in order to provide health education,
self-management support and bridges to care. Automated conversational agents
(specifically, mobile chatbots) present opportunities for providing alternative
and individually tailored access to health education, self-management support
and risk self-assessment. But would patients engage with a chatbot, and what
factors influence engagement? We present results from a patient survey (N=1257)
devised by a team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers,
conducted to identify optimal factors for efficacy, value and engagement for a
chatbot. Results indicate that most adults with asthma (53%) are interested in
using a chatbot and the patients most likely to do so are those who believe
their asthma is more serious and who are less confident about self-management.
Results also indicate enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalisation, and for
WhatsApp as the preferred access method (compared to app, voice assistant, SMS
or website). Obstacles to uptake include security/privacy concerns and
skepticism of technological capabilities. We present detailed findings and
consolidate these into 7 recommendations for developers for optimising efficacy
of chatbot-based health support.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel dual-dictionary framework that links radiomic features to BI-RADS descriptors to enhance AI interpretability in breast cancer diagnosis. It achieves promising results for classifying triple-negative breast cancer versus non-TNBC and enhances clinical adoption through improved transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between radiomic features and standardized clinical lexicons like BI-RADS, addressing the interpretability issue that limits broader adoption of AI-driven radiomics models in breast cancer diagnosis.

Method: The authors created a Clinically-Informed Feature Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) and used SHAP to generate a Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID). They trained 27 classifiers and used feature selection methods to classify TNBC vs non-TNBC from a diverse patient cohort.

Result: The best-performing model combined VIF selection with Extra Trees Classifier, achieving cross-validation accuracy of 0.83. Key predictive features aligned with clinical knowledge, confirming known biomarkers and identifying novel interpretable associations.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-dictionary framework improves the interpretability of radiomics-based AI models, facilitating their clinical integration for breast cancer diagnosis and personalized care.

Abstract: Radiomics-based AI models show promise for breast cancer diagnosis but often
lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. This study addresses the gap
between radiomic features (RF) and the standardized BI-RADS lexicon by
proposing a dual-dictionary framework. First, a Clinically-Informed Feature
Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) was created by mapping 56 RFs to BI-RADS
descriptors (shape, margin, internal enhancement) through literature and expert
review. The framework was applied to classify triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) versus non-TNBC using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from a
multi-institutional cohort of 1,549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning
classifiers with 27 feature selection methods. SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) were used to interpret predictions and generate a complementary
Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID) for 52 additional RFs.
The best model, combining Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) selection with Extra
Trees Classifier, achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.83. Key
predictive RFs aligned with clinical knowledge: higher Sphericity (round/oval
shape) and lower Busyness (more homogeneous enhancement) were associated with
TNBC. The framework confirmed known imaging biomarkers and uncovered novel,
interpretable associations. This dual-dictionary approach (BM1.0) enhances AI
model transparency and supports the integration of RFs into routine breast
cancer diagnosis and personalized care.

TL;DR: The study introduces the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL) function and demonstrates its superiority in optimizing model forecasts for algorithmic investment strategies, showing Transformer models outperform LSTMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design effective machine learning models for quantitative finance, it's necessary to select a suitable loss function that can optimize forecast-generating models for algorithmic investment strategies.

Method: Empirical experiments were conducted on equity and cryptocurrency assets, proposing and using the MADL function to compare the performance of Transformer and LSTM models.

Result: The MADL function was shown to perform well in evaluating forecast models. Additionally, Transformers outperformed LSTM models in nearly all cases.

Conclusion: MADL is an effective loss function for algorithmic investment models, and Transformer architectures provide superior performance compared to LSTMs in this context.

Abstract: The proper design and architecture of testing of machine learning models,
especially in their application to quantitative finance problems, is crucial.
The most important in this process is selecting an adequate loss function used
for training, validation, estimation purposes, and tuning of hyperparameters.
Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and
cryptocurrency assets, we introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL)
function which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used
in algorithmic investment strategies. The MADL function results are compared
for Transformer and LSTM models and we show that almost in every case
Transformer results are significantly better than those obtained with LSTM.

TL;DR: This study compares Bayesian deep learning methods against a deterministic ResNet for nowcasting convective initiation using satellite data, finding Bayesian methods generally superior but with nuanced performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve probabilistic forecasts for convective initiation using satellite data by exploring Bayesian deep learning methods.

Method: Compared five Bayesian deep learning methods with a deterministic ResNet baseline, assessing forecast calibration and error separation capability.

Result: Most Bayesian methods outperformed the deterministic ResNet, with Initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout showing the best calibration and forecast skill. However, some Bayesian methods struggled in specific scenarios.

Conclusion: Bayesian methods provide better uncertainty calibration and forecast skill than deterministic approaches, but their generalization across different conditions needs refinement.

Abstract: This study evaluated the probability and uncertainty forecasts of five
recently proposed Bayesian deep learning methods relative to a deterministic
residual neural network (ResNet) baseline for 0-1 h convective initiation (CI)
nowcasting using GOES-16 satellite infrared observations. Uncertainty was
assessed by how well probabilistic forecasts were calibrated and how well
uncertainty separated forecasts with large and small errors. Most of the
Bayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that
outperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble +
Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different
initial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference,
producing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights
ensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more
thoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the
only one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead
times, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters.
To address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes
using Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced
forecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic
ResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated
uncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors. In
case studies, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout demonstrated better
forecast skill than the Bayesian-MOPED ensemble and the deterministic ResNet on
selected CI events in clear-sky regions. However, the initial-weights ensemble
+ MC dropout exhibited poorer generalization in clear-sky and anvil cloud
regions without CI occurrence compared to the deterministic ResNet and
Bayesian-MOPED ensemble.

TL;DR: This systematic review analyzed 226 studies on machine learning techniques applied to PET and SPECT imaging for cancer outcome prediction, highlighting the superior performance of PET-based models and deep radiomics features (DRF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and compare the performance of different ML, DL, and radiomics models in cancer outcome prediction using PET and SPECT imaging, and identify areas for methodological improvement.

Method: A systematic review of 226 studies (2020-2025) was conducted using a 59-item framework to evaluate dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risks of bias. Performance metrics like accuracy and AUC were analyzed for ML models, including handcrafted radiomics, deep radiomics features, and hybrid approaches.

Result: PET-based imaging outperformed SPECT in accuracy and sensitivity. DRF achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while hybrid fusion models had the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA revealed significant performance differences among model types, but 59% of studies failed to address class imbalance, and 48% didn't adhere to IBSI standards.

Conclusion: While deep radiomics features and fusion models show promising results for cancer outcome prediction, improvements in data quality, standardization, and interpretability are essential for their clinical applicability.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based
methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT
imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features
(HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches
remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review
analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or
SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item
framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation
methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including
model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally
outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and
sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while
fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant
differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common
limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data
(29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI
standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines,
improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.

*Aaron Ho,Lorenzo Zanisi,Bram de Leeuw,Vincent Galvan,Pablo Rodriguez-Fernandez,Nathaniel T. Howard*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework using uncertainty-aware architectures and active learning for developing efficient data-driven surrogate models, specifically applied to plasma turbulent transport in tokamak fusion plasmas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve data efficiency in developing surrogate models, especially for cases like plasma turbulent transport simulations, by leveraging uncertainty-aware architectures and integrating simulations into the model training process.

Method: The approach combines uncertainty-aware architectures (SNGP for classification, BNN-NCP for regression) with active learning, iterating through 45 training steps to expand a dataset from $10^2$ to $10^4$ while utilizing QuaLiKiz as a data labeller.

Result: The proposed method achieved an $F_1$ score of ~0.8 for classification and an $R^2$ score of ~0.75 for regression, demonstrating performance on par with prior frameworks, while handling an additional input dimension.

Conclusion: This framework shows promise for improving data-efficiency and scalability in surrogate modeling, with potential applications beyond the targeted plasma physics use case.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a proof-of-principle for using uncertainty-aware
architectures, in combination with active learning techniques and an
in-the-loop physics simulation code as a data labeller, to construct efficient
datasets for data-driven surrogate model generation. Building off of a previous
proof-of-principle successfully demonstrating training set reduction on static
pre-labelled datasets, using the ADEPT framework, this strategy was applied
again to the plasma turbulent transport problem within tokamak fusion plasmas,
specifically the QuaLiKiz quasilinear electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulent
transport code. While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study
specifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive
codes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP
architecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP
architecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent
modes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\Gamma_e$,
$\Gamma_i$, and $\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45
active learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of
$10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$
classification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75
on an independent test set across all outputs. This extrapolates to reaching
the same performance and efficiency as the previous ADEPT pipeline, although on
a problem with 1 extra input dimension. While the improvement rate achieved in
this implementation diminishes faster than expected, the overall technique is
formulated with components that can be upgraded and generalized to many
surrogate modeling applications beyond plasma turbulent transport predictions.

Motivation: The need for more accurate and efficient simulation predictions in laser-driven implosion experiments, such as the DCI scheme.

Method: The study develops MULTI-Net, a Transformer-based AI model, combined with a Physics-Informed Decoder for high-dimensional sampling to reduce prediction errors.

Result: The model effectively predicts implosion dynamics, matches experimental data, and finds an optimal laser absorption factor of 65% for DCI experiments. For shot 33, key parameters like mean implosion velocity (195 km/s) and plasma density (117 g/cc) were derived.

Conclusion: This work showcases a data-driven AI framework capable of improving prediction capabilities for complex laser fusion experiments, setting a precedent for integrating AI with physics-informed approaches in this domain.

Abstract: This work presents predictive hydrodynamic simulations empowered by
artificial intelligence (AI) for laser driven implosion experiments, taking the
double-cone ignition (DCI) scheme as an example. A Transformer-based deep
learning model MULTI-Net is established to predict implosion features according
to laser waveforms and target radius. A Physics-Informed Decoder (PID) is
proposed for high-dimensional sampling, significantly reducing the prediction
errors compared to Latin hypercube sampling. Applied to DCI experiments
conducted on the SG-II Upgrade facility, the MULTI-Net model is able to predict
the implosion dynamics measured by the x-ray streak camera. It is found that an
effective laser absorption factor about 65\% is suitable for the
one-dimensional simulations of the DCI-R10 experiments. For shot 33, the mean
implosion velocity and collided plasma density reached 195 km/s and 117 g/cc,
respectively. This study demonstrates a data-driven AI framework that enhances
the prediction ability of simulations for complicated laser fusion experiments.

Motivation: To address the accuracy-diversity tradeoff in complementary product recommendations, especially for long-tail items, which is challenging for existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches.

Method: The method involves using LLM-based prompting strategies to directly rerank candidate items from existing recommendation models, bypassing the need for model retraining.

Result: The proposed approach achieved at least a 50% increase in accuracy metrics and a 2% increase in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances accuracy and diversity in product recommendations with significant improvements, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in e-commerce scenarios.

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are
used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in
e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made
significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often
struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail
items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product
recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data
preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting
strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing
recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through
extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach
effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product
recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in
diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

### [346] [Time to Split: Exploring Data Splitting Strategies for Offline Evaluation of Sequential Recommenders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16289)
*Danil Gusak,Anna Volodkevich,Anton Klenitskiy,Alexey Vasilev,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Evaluation methods for sequential recommender systems influence model rankings significantly, and current popular methods like leave-one-out may not suit real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses shortcomings in common sequential recommendation evaluation protocols, highlighting their failure to accurately reflect tasks and real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors systematically compared different splitting strategies, focusing on temporal splitting and its implications, across multiple datasets and baselines.

Result: Findings reveal that evaluation outcomes vary widely depending on the splitting strategy, with prevalent methods like leave-one-out insufficient for realistic assessments.

Conclusion: Properly defining splitting strategies is crucial for improving reproducibility and real-world applicability in sequential recommender systems evaluations.

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems, ranging from lightweight
transformer-based variants to large language models, have become increasingly
prominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the
next-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential
recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the
corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with
real-world scenarios.
  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it
permits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal
leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.
Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct
future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain
loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and
constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between
validation and test metrics.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly
across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical
deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and
industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies
for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established
baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may
be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code:

*Yuxi Lin,Yaxue Fang,Zehong Zhang,Zhouwu Liu,Siyun Zhong,Fulong Yu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study introduces UTR-STCNet, a Transformer-based model for predicting mRNA translational efficiency from variable-length 5'UTRs. It outperforms prior models and provides interpretable insights into functional regulatory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences suffer from limitations such as fixed-length input requirements and low interpretability.

Method: The authors developed UTR-STCNet, an architecture combining a Saliency-Aware Token Clustering (SATC) module to cluster nucleotide tokens based on saliency scores and a Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block to model regulatory dependencies with a lightweight attention mechanism.

Result: UTR-STCNet demonstrated superior performance across three benchmark datasets in predicting translational efficiency (mean ribosome load) and identified biologically meaningful elements like upstream AUGs and Kozak motifs.

Conclusion: UTR-STCNet provides a flexible, computationally efficient, and interpretable approach to modeling 5'UTRs and decoding the regulatory mechanisms underlying mRNA translation, with potential applications in synthetic biology and therapeutics.

Abstract: Understanding how 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) regulate mRNA translation
is critical for controlling protein expression and designing effective
therapeutic mRNAs. While recent deep learning models have shown promise in
predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences, most are constrained
by fixed input lengths and limited interpretability. We introduce UTR-STCNet, a
Transformer-based architecture for flexible and biologically grounded modeling
of variable-length 5'UTRs. UTR-STCNet integrates a Saliency-Aware Token
Clustering (SATC) module that iteratively aggregates nucleotide tokens into
multi-scale, semantically meaningful units based on saliency scores. A
Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block then captures both local and distal
regulatory dependencies using a lightweight attention mechanism. This combined
architecture achieves efficient and interpretable modeling without input
truncation or increased computational cost. Evaluated across three benchmark
datasets, UTR-STCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
predicting mean ribosome load (MRL), a key proxy for translational efficiency.
Moreover, the model recovers known functional elements such as upstream AUGs
and Kozak motifs, highlighting its potential for mechanistic insight into
translation regulation.

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of testing whether a probability measure on a unit disk is supported near a real algebraic variety of specified dimension and bounded degree. It introduces sample complexity bounds and reformulates the problem as a semialgebraic decision task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to determine if a given probability measure is concentrated near a particular class of shapes (real algebraic varieties), understanding both in a quantitative and computational sense.

Method: By leveraging quantitative studies of the Hausdorff geometry for spaces of specific real algebraic varieties and converting the test into a semialgebraic decision problem.

Result: The study establishes an upper bound on the sample complexity required for deciding if the variety hypothesis holds.

Conclusion: The work effectively connects the geometric and computational understanding of algebraic varieties with the task of testing statistical properties like support, offering concrete bounds and decision mechanisms.

Abstract: Given a probability measure on the unit disk, we study the problem of
deciding whether, for some threshold probability, this measure is supported
near a real algebraic variety of given dimension and bounded degree. We call
this "testing the variety hypothesis". We prove an upper bound on the so-called
"sample complexity" of this problem and show how it can be reduced to a
semialgebraic decision problem. This is done by studying in a quantitative way
the Hausdorff geometry of the space of real algebraic varieties of a given
dimension and degree.

TL;DR: The paper explores split learning (SL) for deep learning inference on resource-constrained IoT nodes, presenting an evaluation of different wireless communication protocols on ESP32-S3 boards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory and compute limitations on microcontrollers for TinyML by splitting the inference process between sensor nodes and companion devices.

Method: End-to-end testbed using ESP32-S3 boards to evaluate a quantized MobileNetV2 model, comparing multiple wireless communication protocols: ESP-NOW, BLE, UDP/IP, and TCP/IP.

Result: UDP achieves steady-state latency of 5.8s, ESP-NOW delivers fastest performance with 3.7s RTT, while BLE increases battery life but incurs latency over 10s.

Conclusion: Split learning's feasibility is validated for TinyML on IoT environments, highlighting ESP-NOW's efficiency and BLE's energy benefits in different scenarios.

Abstract: Running deep learning inference directly on ultra-low-power edge/IoT nodes
has been limited by the tight memory and compute budgets of microcontrollers.
Split learning (SL) addresses this limitation in which it executes part of the
inference process on the sensor and off-loads the remainder to a companion
device. In the context of constrained devices and the related impact of
low-power, over-the-air transport protocols, the performance of split learning
remains largely unexplored. TO the best of our knowledge, this paper presents
the first end-to-end TinyML + SL testbed built on Espressif ESP32-S3 boards,
designed to benchmark the over-the-air performance of split learning TinyML in
edge/IoT environments. We benchmark the performance of a MobileNetV2 image
recognition model, which is quantized to 8-bit integers, partitioned, and
delivered to the nodes via over-the-air updates. The intermediate activations
are exchanged through different wireless communication methods: ESP-NOW, BLE,
and traditional UDP/IP and TCP/IP, enabling a head-to-head comparison on
identical hardware. Measurements show that splitting the model after
block_16_project_BN layer generates a 5.66 kB tensor that traverses the link in
3.2 ms, when UDP is used, achieving a steady-state round-trip latency of 5.8 s.
ESP-NOW presents the most favorable RTT performance 3.7 s; BLE extends battery
life further but increases latency beyond 10s.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper assesses the overestimated performance of Representation Learning models in encrypted traffic classification and highlights flaws in data preparation that lead to unrealistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the performance claims of Representation Learning models in encrypted traffic classification and address their real-world applicability.

Method: Extensive analysis of existing models and introduction of Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based model designed for protocol header analysis.

Result: Existing models were found to rely on data shortcuts, reducing effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Pcap-Encoder offers better feature extraction but is complex for practical use.

Conclusion: The study underscores issues in dataset preparation and emphasizes the need for improved evaluation methodologies and rigorous benchmarking.

Abstract: Recently we have witnessed the explosion of proposals that, inspired by
Language Models like BERT, exploit Representation Learning models to create
traffic representations. All of them promise astonishing performance in
encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a
networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through
extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily
influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy
shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during
fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts
are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also
introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we
specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder
appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for
traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in
practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model
training, calling for a better and more conscious test design. We propose a
correct evaluation methodology and stress the need for rigorous benchmarking.

TL;DR: This thesis adopts a distributional perspective on optimization, exploring Bayesian optimization, high-dimensional progress, and step size control in gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical optimization often fails in certain contexts, motivating an investigation of a distributional perspective.

Method: Bayesian optimization frameworks, mathematical tools for random functions, and analysis of isotropic covariance kernels and random objective landscapes.

Result: Insights into predictable optimization progress in high dimensions and optimal step size control in gradient descent.

Conclusion: A distributional approach enhances our understanding of optimization and its underlying mathematical landscapes in machine learning.

Abstract: This PhD thesis presents a distributional view of optimization in place of a
worst-case perspective. We motivate this view with an investigation of the
failure point of classical optimization. Subsequently we consider the
optimization of a randomly drawn objective function. This is the setting of
Bayesian Optimization. After a review of Bayesian optimization we outline how
such a distributional view may explain predictable progress of optimization in
high dimension. It further turns out that this distributional view provides
insights into optimal step size control of gradient descent. To enable these
results, we develop mathematical tools to deal with random input to random
functions and a characterization of non-stationary isotropic covariance
kernels. Finally, we outline how assumptions about the data, specifically
exchangability, can lead to random objective functions in machine learning and
analyze their landscape.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining energy-efficient drones and trucks for last-mile delivery by integrating drone physics into truck delivery routing for optimized plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve last-mile delivery efficiency while reducing environmental impact by integrating drone physics into the optimization process.

Method: An integrated approach combining optimization and machine learning using neural networks to predict drone flight times and enhance truck-drone delivery routing.

Result: The approach improved tour duration and drone energy consumption, outperforming benchmarks while achieving significant cost and environmental benefits.

Conclusion: The framework offers substantial annual savings and environmental benefits, advancing delivery planning efficiency through physical integration of drone dynamics into routing.

Abstract: Combining an energy-efficient drone with a high-capacity truck for last-mile
package delivery can benefit operators and customers by reducing delivery times
and environmental impact. However, directly integrating drone flight dynamics
into the combinatorially hard truck route planning problem is challenging.
Simplified models that ignore drone flight physics can lead to suboptimal
delivery plans. We propose an integrated formulation for the joint problem of
truck route and drone trajectory planning and a new end-to-end solution
approach that combines optimization and machine learning to generate
high-quality solutions in practical online runtimes. Our solution method trains
neural network predictors based on offline solutions to the drone trajectory
optimization problem instances to approximate drone flight times, and uses
these approximations to optimize the overall truck-and-drone delivery plan by
augmenting an existing order-first-split-second heuristic. Our method
explicitly incorporates key kinematics and energy equations in drone trajectory
optimization, and thereby outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks that ignore
drone flight physics. Extensive experimentation using synthetic datasets and
real-world case studies shows that the integration of drone trajectories into
package delivery planning substantially improves system performance in terms of
tour duration and drone energy consumption. Our modeling and computational
framework can help delivery planners achieve annual savings worth millions of
dollars while also benefiting the environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based surrogate models in CFD provide computational efficiency but are limited by their opacity, making them unsuitable for critical applications requiring explainability, such as safety-critical or regulated environments.

Method: The paper employs sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create an overcomplete basis in the node embedding space of pretrained CFD surrogate models, extracting interpretable features that correspond to physical phenomena.

Result: The method successfully identifies interpretable, monosemantic concepts, such as vorticity and flow structures, from the node embedding space, improving model transparency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework increases the explainability and trustworthiness of learning-based surrogate models in CFD, which could facilitate broader adoption and application of these models in regulated or high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Learning-based surrogate models have become a practical alternative to
high-fidelity CFD solvers, but their latent representations remain opaque and
hinder adoption in safety-critical or regulation-bound settings. This work
introduces a posthoc interpretability framework for graph-based surrogate
models used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). By obtaining an overcomplete basis in the node embedding
space of a pretrained surrogate, the method extracts a dictionary of
interpretable latent features. The approach enables the identification of
monosemantic concepts aligned with physical phenomena such as vorticity or flow
structures, offering a model-agnostic pathway to enhance explainability and

Motivation: Traditional portfolio optimization methods face challenges in scalability and flexibility with large datasets, complex constraints, and multiple objectives.

Method: The study introduces a benchmark framework utilizing gradient descent with automatic differentiation to optimize objectives and handle realistic constraints.

Result: The proposed framework delivers competitive performance compared to standard solvers like CVXPY and SKFOLIO, across six experimental scenarios.

Conclusion: This framework is a practical and extensible tool for tackling advanced portfolio optimization challenges in real-world settings.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to portfolio optimization, often rooted in Modern
Portfolio Theory and solved via quadratic programming or evolutionary
algorithms, struggle with scalability or flexibility, especially in scenarios
involving complex constraints, large datasets and/or multiple conflicting
objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce a benchmark framework for
multi-objective portfolio optimization (MPO) using gradient descent with
automatic differentiation. Our method supports any optimization objective, such
as minimizing risk measures (e.g., CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratio, along with
realistic constraints, such as tracking error limits, UCITS regulations, or
asset group restrictions. We have evaluated our framework across six
experimental scenarios, from single-objective setups to complex multi-objective
cases, and have compared its performance against standard solvers like CVXPY
and SKFOLIO. Our results show that our method achieves competitive performance
while offering enhanced flexibility for modeling multiple objectives and
constraints. We aim to provide a practical and extensible tool for researchers
and practitioners exploring advanced portfolio optimization problems in

Motivation: To overcome the challenge of validating ML-enabled network slicing orchestration in production environments rather than just local or simulation setups.

Method: A network slicing prediction model using DNNs and ML algorithms is tested in two large-scale production testbeds, focusing on latency forecasting.

Result: Performance of various DNNs and ML algorithms is measured and compared, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI-based models in enhancing network slicing orchestration.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable and production-ready validation approach for AI-native network slicing, showing its feasibility in real-world testbeds.

Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) realization requires AI-native orchestration
architectures to efficiently and intelligently handle heterogeneous user
requirements. To achieve this, network slicing is evolving towards a more
user-centric digital transformation, focusing on architectures that incorporate
native intelligence to enable self-managed connectivity in an integrated and
isolated manner. However, these initiatives face the challenge of validating
their results in production environments, particularly those utilizing
ML-enabled orchestration, as they are often tested in local networks or
laboratory simulations. This paper proposes a large-scale validation method
using a network slicing prediction model to forecast latency using Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within an NS architecture,
evaluated in real large-scale production testbeds. It measures and compares the
performance of different DNNs and ML algorithms, considering a distributed
database application deployed as a network slice over two large-scale
production testbeds. The investigation highlights how AI-based prediction

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical solutions of the Helmholtz equation in geophysical applications face high computational and memory challenges.

Method: PICNO combines background wavefields, velocity models as inputs, and incorporates PDE constraints during training to ensure physics-based predictions.

Result: Compared to a purely data-driven CNN approach, PICNO offers high-resolution, accurate predictions even with limited data training, excelling particularly in high-frequency wavefields.

Conclusion: PICNO efficiently captures wave phenomena and significantly enhances waveform inversion capabilities, making it suitable for demanding geophysical applications.

Abstract: Solving the wave equation is fundamental for geophysical applications.
However, numerical solutions of the Helmholtz equation face significant
computational and memory challenges. Therefore, we introduce a physics-informed
convolutional neural operator (PICNO) to solve the Helmholtz equation
efficiently. The PICNO takes both the background wavefield corresponding to a
homogeneous medium and the velocity model as input function space, generating
the scattered wavefield as the output function space. Our workflow integrates
PDE constraints directly into the training process, enabling the neural
operator to not only fit the available data but also capture the underlying
physics governing wave phenomena. PICNO allows for high-resolution reasonably
accurate predictions even with limited training samples, and it demonstrates
significant improvements over a purely data-driven convolutional neural
operator (CNO), particularly in predicting high-frequency wavefields. These
features and improvements are important for waveform inversion down the road.

Motivation: Alloy discovery faces challenges due to expansive compositional spaces and expensive validation. Accelerating this process is crucial for industrial advancement.

Method: AutoMAT integrates large language models, CALPHAD simulations, and AI-driven search in a hierarchical pipeline, spanning ideation to validation without need for large datasets.

Result: AutoMAT successfully identified improved titanium and high-entropy alloys with enhanced properties, achieving significant improvements in strengths and densities.

Conclusion: AutoMAT showcases scalability, efficiency, and accuracy in alloy design, significantly reducing discovery timelines and paving the way for future industrial applications.

Abstract: Alloy discovery is central to advancing modern industry but remains hindered
by the vastness of compositional design space and the costly validation. Here,
we present AutoMAT, a hierarchical and autonomous framework grounded in and
validated by experiments, which integrates large language models, automated
CALPHAD-based simulations, and AI-driven search to accelerate alloy design.
Spanning the entire pipeline from ideation to validation, AutoMAT achieves high
efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability without the need for manually
curated large datasets. In a case study targeting a lightweight, high-strength
alloy, AutoMAT identifies a titanium alloy with 8.1% lower density and
comparable yield strength relative to the state-of-the-art reference, achieving
the highest specific strength among all comparisons. In a second case targeting
high-yield-strength high-entropy alloys, AutoMAT achieves a 28.2% improvement
in yield strength over the base alloy. In both cases, AutoMAT reduces the
discovery timeline from years to weeks, illustrating its potential as a

Motivation: Traditional alloy design relies heavily on empirical laws and numerous trials, which is both costly and inefficient, limiting exploration in vast material spaces.

Method: The authors construct dynamic material networks based on historical data of amorphous alloys to identify hidden candidates. Network topology analysis is used to uncover innovative materials and predict alloy design paths.

Result: Material networks successfully identified alloy candidates previously hidden in tabular data representations and showcased predictive capabilities by uncovering innovative designs encoded within the network.

Conclusion: Material networks offer a scalable and efficient framework for intelligent material design, especially for complex alloys, presenting an alternative to traditional experimental methods.

Abstract: Designing high-performance amorphous alloys is demanding for various
applications. But this process intensively relies on empirical laws and
unlimited attempts. The high-cost and low-efficiency nature of the traditional
strategies prevents effective sampling in the enormous material space. Here, we
propose material networks to accelerate the discovery of binary and ternary
amorphous alloys. The network topologies reveal hidden material candidates that
were obscured by traditional tabular data representations. By scrutinizing the
amorphous alloys synthesized in different years, we construct dynamical
material networks to track the history of the alloy discovery. We find that
some innovative materials designed in the past were encoded in the networks,
demonstrating their predictive power in guiding new alloy design. These
material networks show physical similarities with several real-world networks

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents an algorithm to optimize runtime AI monitoring protocols, combining multiple monitors to enhance safety while adhering to budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to maximize safety interventions (recall) for AI's misaligned outputs while balancing monitoring and intervention costs.

Method: An exhaustive search algorithm based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma to allocate monitors and safety interventions effectively.

Result: More than doubling recall rates compared to a naive baseline in code review settings and showing that combining monitors can outperform individual ones.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic approach to unify monitors for detecting AI misbehavior efficiently and cost-effectively.

Abstract: Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In
this paper, we study how to combine multiple runtime monitors into a single
monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of
applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall).
Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the
protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the
monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the
most efficient protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and
which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the
Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically
trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more
than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review
setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using
either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for
combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive
settings.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the role of online activities in youth suicide using thematic analysis and a zero-shot learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rise in youth suicide and understand how online activities contribute to this issue.

Method: Thematic analysis of 29,124 death investigation summaries to identify 12 online activity themes, modeled at scale using a zero-shot learning framework.

Result: Identified distinct online activities correlated with suicide risk phases and linked them to decedent characteristics; themes intensified during COVID-19 lockdowns.

Conclusion: Digital spaces can benefit from interventions targeting subtle indicators of suicide risk by integrating suicide theories and computational methods.

Abstract: The recent rise in youth suicide highlights the urgent need to understand how
online experiences contribute to this public health issue. Our mixed-methods
approach responds to this challenge by developing a set of themes focused on
risk factors for suicide mortality in online spaces among youth ages 10-24, and
a framework to model these themes at scale. Using 29,124 open text summaries of
death investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to
identify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or
next of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death. We then
develop a zero-shot learning framework to model these 12 themes at scale, and
analyze variation in these themes by decedent characteristics and over time.
Our work uncovers several online activities related to harm to self, harm to
others, interpersonal interactions, activity levels online, and life events,
which correspond to different phases of suicide risk from two prominent suicide
theories. We find an association between these themes and decedent
characteristics like age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, and many
themes became more prevalent during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. While digital
spaces have taken some steps to address expressions of suicidality online, our
work illustrates the opportunities for developing interventions related to less
explicit indicators of suicide risk by combining suicide theories with
computational research.

TL;DR: This study examined the capability of Western and Indian LLMs to identify ableist harm in Hindi-translated speech, finding disparities and biases tied to cultural framing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in understanding how large language models (LLMs) recognize online ableism in non-Western regions like India, focusing on the unique challenges due to cultural differences and limited resources for PwD.

Method: Researchers translated an ableist speech dataset into Hindi, prompted four Western and four Indic LLMs to assess and explain ableism, and compared their outputs with the judgments of 175 PwD from the U.S. and India.

Result: Western LLMs overestimated ableist harm while Indian LLMs underestimated it. All models demonstrated biases, being more tolerant of ableism expressed in Hindi and framing ableist harm through a Western lens.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of incorporating local disability experiences and context in the design and evaluation of AI systems, advocating for global, inclusive standards to address ableism.

Abstract: People with disabilities (PwD) experience disproportionately high levels of
discrimination and hate online, particularly in India, where entrenched stigma
and limited resources intensify these challenges. Large language models (LLMs)
are increasingly used to identify and mitigate online hate, yet most research
on online ableism focuses on Western audiences with Western AI models. Are
these models adequately equipped to recognize ableist harm in non-Western
places like India? Do localized, Indic language models perform better? To
investigate, we adopted and translated a publicly available ableist speech
dataset to Hindi, and prompted eight LLMs--four developed in the U.S. (GPT-4,
Gemini, Claude, Llama) and four in India (Krutrim, Nanda, Gajendra,
Airavata)--to score and explain ableism. In parallel, we recruited 175 PwD from
both the U.S. and India to perform the same task, revealing stark differences
between groups. Western LLMs consistently overestimated ableist harm, while
Indic LLMs underestimated it. Even more concerning, all LLMs were more tolerant
of ableism when it was expressed in Hindi and asserted Western framings of
ableist harm. In contrast, Indian PwD interpreted harm through intention,
relationality, and resilience--emphasizing a desire to inform and educate
perpetrators. This work provides groundwork for global, inclusive standards of
ableism, demonstrating the need to center local disability experiences in the
design and evaluation of AI systems.

*Bruno Scarone,Ricardo Baeza-Yates*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the societal impacts of pseudo-scientific assumptions in financial lending predictions, detailing how survival bias affects model performance and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the practical implications and societal consequences of pseudo-scientific machine learning models used for financial risk prediction.

Method: The authors evaluate commonly used machine learning models and datasets, analyzing their accuracy and social cost, while also observing the effects of survival bias over time.

Result: Findings reveal that models suffering from survival bias exhibit deteriorating accuracy but improving recall and precision, creating a misleading perception of better performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that survival bias masks the increasing unfairness of machine learning predictions in financial lending, calling attention to the deceptive dynamics of such models.

Abstract: We study the societal impact of pseudo-scientific assumptions for predicting
the behavior of people in a straightforward application of machine learning to
risk prediction in financial lending. This use case also exemplifies the impact
of survival bias in loan return prediction. We analyze the models in terms of
their accuracy and social cost, showing that the socially optimal model may not
imply a significant accuracy loss for this downstream task. Our results are
verified for commonly used learning methods and datasets. Our findings also
show that there is a natural dynamic when training models that suffer survival
bias where accuracy slightly deteriorates, and whose recall and precision
improves with time. These results act as an illusion, leading the observer to
believe that the system is getting better, when in fact the model is suffering
from increasingly more unfairness and survival bias.

### [363] [PRAC3 (Privacy, Reputation, Accountability, Consent, Credit, Compensation): Long Tailed Risks of Voice Actors in AI Data-Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16247)
*Tanusree Sharma,Yihao Zhou,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores risks faced by voice actors due to synthetic voice replication and introduces the PRAC3 framework to address privacy, reputation, and accountability issues alongside existing ethical considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by a decade-long evolution in the use of large-scale audio datasets, which has highlighted emergent risks to contributors' vocal identities, particularly as technologies enabling synthetic voice replication grow more advanced.

Method: The authors conducted qualitative interviews with 20 professional voice actors to explore the consequences of synthetic voice replication on individuals' privacy, reputation, and agency.

Result: The research identified numerous risks, including reputational harm and accountability breakdowns from non-consensual use of voices in harmful or inappropriate contexts, as well as limited legal and union support for voice actors.

Conclusion: The study advocates for the adoption of the PRAC3 framework, which emphasizes privacy, reputation, accountability, consent, credit, and compensation as essential pillars for ethical governance of synthetic voice data.

Abstract: Early large-scale audio datasets, such as LibriSpeech, were built with
hundreds of individual contributors whose voices were instrumental in the
development of speech technologies, including audiobooks and voice assistants.
Yet, a decade later, these same contributions have exposed voice actors to a
range of risks. While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,
and Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks
involving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,
authorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional
voice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without
enforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond
reputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive
political messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about
accountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that
are deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation
campaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal
fallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or
union protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the
PRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation,
Accountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of
data used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy
risks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm
arises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be
reimagined AI Data ecosystems. We argue that voice, as both a biometric
identifier and creative labor, demands governance models that restore creator
agency, ensure traceability, and establish enforceable boundaries for ethical
reuse.

*Octavian M. Machidon*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques AI-driven recommender systems (RSs) for ethical issues and proposes a human-centered framework for improving their design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by RSs, such as their influence on privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being.

Method: Critiques the limitations of current ethical approaches like algorethics and proposes a human-centered RS design framework that includes interdisciplinary perspectives, regulatory strategies, and educational initiatives.

Result: Acknowledges that RSs prioritize engagement over well-being and exploit user vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for a shift in design approaches.

Conclusion: Calls for a move beyond technical fixes to ensure RSs support human autonomy and societal well-being.

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by
AI-driven recommender systems (RSs), which have become central to shaping
digital environments and social interactions. By curating personalized content,
RSs do not merely reflect user preferences but actively construct individual
experiences across social media, entertainment platforms, and e-commerce.
Despite their ubiquity, the ethical implications of RSs remain insufficiently
explored, even as concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being
intensify. I argue that existing ethical approaches, including algorethics, the
effort to embed ethical principles into algorithmic design, are necessary but
ultimately inadequate. RSs inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable
dimensions, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over
well-being. Addressing these concerns requires moving beyond purely technical
solutions. I propose a comprehensive framework for human-centered RS design,
integrating interdisciplinary perspectives, regulatory strategies, and
educational initiatives to ensure AI systems foster rather than undermine human
autonomy and societal flourishing.

### [365] [Is memory all you need? Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058)
*Xander de Wit,Alessandro Gabbana,Michael Woodward,Yen Ting Lin,Federico Toschi,Daniel Livescu*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper develops a machine learning-based surrogate model to predict Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulence accurately for short- and long-term timescales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows is essential for applications like mixing, transport, and dispersion, but direct numerical simulation is computationally expensive.

Method: The approach utilizes the Mori–Zwanzig formalism paired with machine learning techniques to train reduced-order models using a short-time error metric for stable and accurate long-term statistical predictions.

Result: The surrogate model successfully replicates both short-term precision and long-term statistical accuracy in turbulent Lagrangian trajectories.

Conclusion: The model provides an effective and computationally efficient way to simulate Lagrangian turbulence, enabling applications such as active control of Lagrangian agents.

Abstract: The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in
mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their
trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the
development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without
incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the
full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because
reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with
the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques
can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the
reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a
surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian
trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions
(with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long
times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes
a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved
dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set
of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees
of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order
model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to
correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the
long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up
a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian
agents in turbulence.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new AI model, the Turbulence Transformer, along with the RingX sequence parallelism approach to efficiently capture turbulence's multiscale characteristics using supercomputers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the study lies in the need to accurately capture turbulence's multiscale characteristics for reliable predictions in multiphysics applications, which remains difficult due to extreme resolution requirements and high computational costs.

Method: The authors introduce the multiscale hierarchical Turbulence Transformer that reduces sequence length significantly and a RingX sequence parallelism approach for scalable long-context learning. These methods are tested on the Frontier supercomputer.

Result: The approach achieves a performance of 1.1 EFLOPS on 32,768 AMD GPUs with a 94% scaling efficiency and successfully captures small-scale turbulence eddies down to the dissipative range.

Conclusion: The paper presents a highly efficient AI framework for turbulence modeling that surpasses prior methods in scalability, resolution, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Turbulence plays a crucial role in multiphysics applications, including
aerodynamics, fusion, and combustion. Accurately capturing turbulence's
multiscale characteristics is essential for reliable predictions of
multiphysics interactions, but remains a grand challenge even for exascale
supercomputers and advanced deep learning models. The extreme-resolution data
required to represent turbulence, ranging from billions to trillions of grid
points, pose prohibitive computational costs for models based on architectures
like vision transformers. To address this challenge, we introduce a multiscale
hierarchical Turbulence Transformer that reduces sequence length from billions
to a few millions and a novel RingX sequence parallelism approach that enables
scalable long-context learning. We perform scaling and science runs on the
Frontier supercomputer. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance up to
1.1 EFLOPS on 32,768 AMD GPUs, with a scaling efficiency of 94%. To our
knowledge, this is the first AI model for turbulence that can capture
small-scale eddies down to the dissipative range.

### [367] [Toward Routine CSP of Pharmaceuticals: A Fully Automated Protocol Using Neural Network Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16218)
*Zachary L. Glick,Derek P. Metcalf,Scott F. Swarthout*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fully automated and efficient protocol for crystal structure prediction (CSP) using a novel neural network potential (Lavo-NN), reducing computational costs and enabling widespread adoption in pharmaceutical development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crystal structure prediction in pharmaceuticals is limited by high computational costs and dependence on expert input, hindering its widespread adoption.

Method: The authors developed a fully automated high-throughput CSP protocol featuring Lavo-NN, a neural network potential tailored for generating and ranking pharmaceutical crystal structures, integrated into a cloud-based workflow.

Result: The protocol was validated on a retrospective benchmark of 49 molecules, successfully matching 110 experimental polymorphs with an average computational cost of 8.4k CPU hours, showcasing significant efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: This protocol enables routine CSP deployment earlier in the drug discovery process, facilitates real-time experimental collaboration, and reduces time and cost significantly, enhancing its practical utility.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is a useful tool in pharmaceutical
development for identifying and assessing risks associated with polymorphism,
yet widespread adoption has been hindered by high computational costs and the
need for both manual specification and expert knowledge to achieve useful
results. Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol
designed to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by
Lavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained
specifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This
NNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based
workflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark
of 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully
generating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The
average CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours,
which is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical
utility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that
resolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that
successfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder
X-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time
and cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug
discovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times
and high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with
experimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide
their work in the lab.

*Gautam Kishore Shahi,Scot A. Hale*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the functionality of WhatsApp tiplines during the 2021 Indian assembly elections and provides insights on claims submitted for fact-checking in various languages, revealing trends, user behavior, and system efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the effectiveness and nuances of WhatsApp tiplines in combating misinformation across different languages and user groups during the electoral process.

Method: The researchers utilized a mixed-method approach by analyzing 580 unique claims across three content categories (election, COVID-19, others) in English, Hindi, and Telugu. They performed linguistic analysis, content clustering, and cross-language user behavior examination.

Result: The results showed language-specific variations in claims, overlapping users submitting tips in multiple languages, and fact-checking organizations taking a few days to address claims. Unique audiences were observed for each organization.

Conclusion: WhatsApp tiplines are effective in curbing misinformation, with room for improving turnaround times and addressing ethical considerations during critical events like elections.

Abstract: WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable
users to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study
analyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource
languages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021
Indian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the
claims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe
variations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent
word analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate
user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the
average time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal
similarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in
multiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a
couple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably,
no user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that
each organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical
recommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration
of users' information.

*Keen Leung,Colen Yan,Jun Yin*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework for efficient and accurate extraction of galaxy morphology from large-scale photometric surveys, addressing challenges of computational limitations in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop scalable and efficient computational methods to analyze galaxy morphology from the massive datasets expected in ongoing and future photometric surveys.

Method: The paper proposes a Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) trained on mock galaxy images to encode low-dimensional representations conditioned on morphological parameters, enabling parameter recovery and image reconstruction.

Result: The CAE demonstrates accurate and efficient inference of galaxy structural properties, showing promise as a computationally feasible alternative for large-scale morphological analysis.

Conclusion: The study concludes that CAEs are effective and computationally efficient tools for recovering and modeling galaxy morphology from large datasets, making them suitable for upcoming photometric surveys.

Abstract: Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of
galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy
morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric
light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally
prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a
Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and
characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock
galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types,
photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index,
ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into
a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our
model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled
manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate
that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural
properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.
