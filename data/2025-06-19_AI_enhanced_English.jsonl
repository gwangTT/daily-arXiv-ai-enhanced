Ideally, training an\nSAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.\nHowever, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising\nconcerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense\nlatents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be\ndismissed as training noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders for language models, showing they are meaningful and functional, not mere artifacts of training.", "motivation": "To understand the nature of dense latents in sparse autoencoders, questioning whether they are undesirable artifacts or meaningful representations.", "method": "The study uses systematic investigation of dense latents' geometry, function, origin, and evolution across layers.
