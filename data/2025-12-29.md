### [1] [From Visual Perception to Deep Empathy: An Automated Assessment Framework for House-Tree-Person Drawings Using Multimodal LLMs and Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21360)
*Shuide Wen,Yu Sun,Beier Ku,Zhi Gao,Lijun Ma,Yang Yang,Can Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the integration of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) into the widely used psychological HTP drawing test and demonstrates its utility for standardized assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in the HTP test, such as subjective scoring and lack of a unified quantitative system, by leveraging modern AI technologies.

Method: The study employed multimodal large language models and a multi-agent framework to interpret HTP test results, incorporating quantitative analyses and expert comparisons.

Result: MLLM interpretations showed high semantic similarity (0.75 to 0.85) with human expert analyses, proving its baseline comprehension and efficacy. The multi-agent design heightened coherence and psychological report quality.

Conclusion: Multimodal large models, along with role-divided multi-agent systems, offer a standardized, precise approach for projective psychological assessments, presenting a scalable solution for digital mental health services.

Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.

### [2] [A Study of Solving Life-and-Death Problems in Go Using Relevance-Zone Based Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21365)
*Chung-Chin Shih,Ti-Rong Wu,Ting Han Wei,Yu-Shan Hsu,Hung Guei,I-Chen Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and pattern tables in computer Go solvers for solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art Go solvers in solving complex L&D problems, identify their strengths, unique behaviors, and limitations.

Method: Applied Relevance-Zone Based Search and relevance-zone pattern tables to seven L&D problems, evaluating solutions produced by computer solvers based on critical zones and patterns.

Result: Solvers highlighted relevance-zones, discovered rare patterns, and deviated from human-intended solutions for some problems. They faced challenges such as misjudging rare patterns and prioritizing survival over maximizing territory.

Conclusion: Relevance-zone techniques offer potential in solving L&D problems, but solvers need enhancements to align better with human strategies. Future work should address limitations in pattern evaluation and territorial priorities.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

### [3] [Three-way conflict analysis based on alliance and conflict functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21419)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang,Xin Yang,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses three-way conflict analysis by introducing separate alliance and conflict functions for better clarity, exploring their applications, and demonstrating them through real-world examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge posed by existing functions (rating and auxiliary) that measure two opposing aspects in a single function, which complicates interpretation, especially in assessing relationships and aggregations.

Method: It separates the contrasting aspects in an auxiliary function into distinct alliance and conflict functions, allowing a more precise trisecting of agents, issues, and agent pairs. It also introduces alliance sets and strategies to apply these refined models.

Result: The redefined models clarify semantic differences, avoiding misrepresentation of agent relations in conflict analysis. New questions in conflict handling can be assessed through example applications.

Conclusion: Separating alliance and conflict functions improves the interpretability and application of three-way conflict analysis, offering new analytical tools and real-world applications.

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

### [4] [Feasible strategies in three-way conflict analysis with three-valued ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21420)
*Jing Liu,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel methodology for resolving three-way conflicts by analyzing consistency and non-consistency measures, ultimately identifying optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has explored three-way conflict analysis but lacks sufficient focus on strategies for resolution and mitigation, which motivated the development of a model addressing this gap.

Method: The authors compute the overall rating of agents using positive and negative similarity degrees. They introduce weighted consistency and non-consistency measures to identify strategies for resolution, developing algorithms for feasible and optimal strategies.

Result: The proposed models are tested on NBA labor negotiations and Gansu Province development plans, demonstrating superiority in systematically identifying and optimizing solutions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The models unify agents and issues evaluations with consistency/non-consistency measures. They effectively outperform traditional approaches while providing practical solutions in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

### [5] [Three-way decision with incomplete information based on similarity and satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21421)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper generalizes computational and conceptual three-way decision formulations to handle incomplete information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to extend three-way decision models, typically designed for complete information, to effectively manage incomplete information for real-world applications.

Method: The paper proposes a generalization of equivalence relations into similarity degree and introduces measures for satisfiability degree of logic formulas. These measures are then utilized in respective computational and conceptual approaches for decision-making.

Result: The study presents two new approaches for three-way decision: one using alpha-similarity classes and approximability under computational formulation, and the other using alpha-meaning sets and confidence of formulas under conceptual formulation.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the promise of approximability and conceptual approaches in expanding the scope of three-way decisions for incomplete information, opening up new research directions.

Abstract: Three-way decision is widely applied with rough set theory to learn classification or decision rules. The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.

### [6] [LogicLens: Visual-Logical Co-Reasoning for Text-Centric Forgery Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21482)
*Fanwei Zeng,Changtao Miao,Jing Huang,Zhiya Tan,Shutao Gong,Xiaoming Yu,Yang Wang,Huazhe Tan,Weibin Yao,Jianshu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogicLens, a unified framework addressing text-centric forgery analysis using visual-textual co-reasoning and achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advancements in AIGC lead to text-centric forgeries threatening societal security and information authenticity. Existing analysis methods lack intricate reasoning and overlook the relationship between detection, grounding, and explanation.

Method: LogicLens employs the Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought mechanism for visual-textual reasoning and utilizes a weighted multi-task reward function for optimization. It integrates the PR$^2$ pipeline for annotation generation and leverages the RealText dataset for training.

Result: LogicLens demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving 41.4% and 23.4% superiority over specialized frameworks and GPT-4o, respectively, in a zero-shot evaluation. It also excels on dense-text datasets compared to other methods.

Conclusion: LogicLens effectively addresses limitations in text-centric forgery analysis by combining reasoning tasks into a unified system. Its methodology and dataset enhance analysis accuracy, and its effectiveness is validated through extensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Sophisticated text-centric forgeries, fueled by rapid AIGC advancements, pose a significant threat to societal security and information authenticity. Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1. Our dataset, model, and code will be made publicly available.

### [7] [Leash: Adaptive Length Penalty and Reward Shaping for Efficient Large Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21540)
*Yanhao Li,Lu Ma,Jiaran Zhang,Lexiang Tang,Wentao Zhang,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Leash, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically adjusts length penalties for efficient reasoning in LLMs without performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the inefficiency caused by fixed length penalties in existing approaches, which fail to adapt to LLMs' evolving reasoning abilities, leading to suboptimal accuracy and conciseness.

Method: Leash uses an adaptive mechanism based on a Lagrangian primal-dual method that adjusts penalties dynamically depending on whether the generated text exceeds or falls short of the target length.

Result: Leash reduces reasoning length by 60% while maintaining performance across tasks like mathematical reasoning, coding, and instruction following.

Conclusion: Leash offers a practical approach for developing efficient, controllable LLMs, balancing reasoning abilities with computational costs.

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on fixed length penalties, but such penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness. To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Result: The optimized retrieval agent improves latency and cost efficiency, resolving the primary bottleneck while preserving or enhancing system quality.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates scalable optimization for multi-agent systems in e-commerce, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: We present the development and optimization of PayPal's Commerce Agent, powered by NEMO-4-PAYPAL, a multi-agent system designed to revolutionize agentic commerce on the PayPal platform. Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).
  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.

### [9] [A Medical Multimodal Diagnostic Framework Integrating Vision-Language Models and Logic Tree Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21583)
*Zelin Zang,Wenyi Gu,Siqi Ma,Dan Yang,Yue Shen,Zhu Zhang,Guohui Fan,Wing-Kuen Ling,Fuji Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diagnostic framework combining multimodal alignment with logic-regularized reasoning to enhance trustworthy AI in medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations and inconsistent reasoning in multimodal medical AI systems and improve clinical trust.

Method: Developed a diagnostic framework using vision-language alignment, logic-regularized reasoning, an input encoder, a projection module, a reasoning controller, and a logic tree generator.

Result: Evaluations on benchmarks show improved diagnostic accuracy and more interpretable reasoning while maintaining competitiveness in text-only tasks.

Conclusion: The framework represents a promising direction for reliable multimodal medical AI with enhanced diagnostic reasoning and trustworthiness.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine, simply integrating clinical text and medical imaging does not guarantee reliable reasoning. Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

*Zhishuai Zhang,Xintian Li,Shilong Liu,Aodong Zhang,Lu Jie,Nan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMS-IO-Agent is a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for generating AMS I/O subsystems, achieving high efficiency and practical validation in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for connecting natural language design intent to industrial AMS IC deliverables and automating structure-aware subsystems without compromising standards.

Method: The paper introduces AMS-IO-Agent by combining a domain knowledge base and intent structuring with JSON/Python formats. It also proposes AMS-IO-Bench for benchmarking the agent's performance.

Result: AMS-IO-Agent achieved over 70% DRC+LVS pass rate, reduced design turnaround time significantly, and demonstrated practical effectiveness through silicon validation in AMS IC design processes.

Conclusion: This research advances human-agent collaborative AMS IC design by proving the agent's effectiveness in completing tasks directly applied to real silicon, marking a first-time achievement in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AMS-IO-Agent, a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for structure-aware input/output (I/O) subsystem generation in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs). The central contribution of this work is a framework that connects natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables. AMS-IO-Agent integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base that captures reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats. We further introduce AMS-IO-Bench, a benchmark for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O ring automation. On this benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieves over 70\% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduces design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming the baseline LLM. Furthermore, an agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the approach in real AMS IC design flows. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design in which an LLM-based agent completes a nontrivial subtask with outputs directly used in silicon.

*Takahide Suzuki,Kazuki Nakanishi,Takashi Fujiwara,Hideyuki Shimizu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents OrchestRA, a multi-agent platform integrating biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous therapeutic discovery engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in therapeutic discovery caused by fragmented specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation.

Method: OrchestRA employs an orchestrated multi-agent system combining a Biologist Agent, Chemist Agent, and Pharmacologist Agent, with human-in-the-loop guidance. Each agent independently analyzes, designs, and optimizes drug candidates leveraging deep reasoning, simulations, and PBPK modeling.

Result: This platform enables dynamic feedback loops where pharmacokinetics and toxicity trigger reoptimization of drug candidates, fostering efficient and automated therapeutic design.

Conclusion: OrchestRA revolutionizes therapeutic discovery by shifting from stochastic processes to a structured, evidence-based engineering approach, offering accessibility and enhanced precision in drug development.

Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

### [12] [Multiple-play Stochastic Bandits with Prioritized Arm Capacity Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21626)
*Hong Xie,Haoran Gu,Yanying Huang,Tao Tan,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tackles resource allocation problems using a multiple-play stochastic bandit model, addressing challenges from prioritized resource sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize resource allocation in applications like LLMs and edge intelligence where competing entities require prioritized sharing of limited resources.

Method: A new stochastic bandit model with priority-weighted plays and capacity-limited arms is proposed. Instance independent and dependent regret bounds are derived, and two algorithms (MSB-PRS-OffOpt and an approximate UCB-based method) are developed to optimize play allocations.

Result: The algorithm achieves regret bounds closely matching the theoretical minimums, thus providing an effective solution to capacity-based resource allocation.

Conclusion: The study introduces efficient strategies for handling nonlinear combinatorial utility functions, improving resource allocation outcomes in systems with constrained resources.

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an architecture for producing responsible and explainable agentic AI workflows by using multi-model consensus and a reasoning-layer governance system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges like explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance that arise due to the autonomy introduced in agentic AI systems.

Method: It proposes an architecture with heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents generating outputs independently, followed by a reasoning agent consolidating them to ensure safety, mitigate bias, and provide auditable decisions.

Result: The architecture improves robustness, transparency, and trust through consensus-driven reasoning evaluated on real-world workflows.

Conclusion: This design enables agentic AI systems to be autonomous, scalable, responsible, and explainable while providing practical guidance for their implementation.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

Motivation: There is a lack of attention to the ethical and legal considerations for AI datasets, especially concerning their origin, transparency, and safety.

Method: The authors introduce CRS and a Python library leveraging data provenance technology to evaluate and improve dataset compliance with critical ethical and legal principles.

Result: The CRS framework and accompanying Python library facilitate the evaluation of dataset compliance and responsible dataset creation.

Conclusion: The proposed tools offer a proactive and reactive approach to address gaps in ethical and legal oversight in AI dataset practices, promoting transparency and accountability.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGA, a framework that improves scientific discovery agents by automating objective function design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of relying on imperfect proxies for quantitative objectives in scientific discovery.

Method: The SAGA framework uses a bi-level architecture: an outer loop with LLM agents proposes and refines objectives, while an inner loop optimizes solutions under existing objectives.

Result: SAGA demonstrated significant improvements in scientific discovery processes across multiple domains like antibiotic design and chemical process design.

Conclusion: Automating objective formulation enhances the capabilities of scientific discovery agents, allowing better exploration of objectives and trade-offs.

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

*Kenny Workman,Zhen Yang,Harihara Muralidharan,Hannah Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialBench, a benchmark framework for assessing AI agents' ability to handle spatial transcriptomics data, highlighting current models' low accuracy and emphasizing the importance of design for real-world biological insight extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of analyzing increasingly complex spatial transcriptomics datasets, where computational analysis is a limiting factor for biological discoveries.

Method: SpatialBench comprises 146 problems from practical workflows in spatial transcriptomics spanning five technologies and seven task types, offering deterministic grading to evaluate biological result recovery.

Result: The benchmark shows that current AI models have low accuracy (20-38%), with performance varying based on task, model, and platform, alongside the large effect of harness design.

Conclusion: SpatialBench offers a valuable tool for measuring and improving AI agents' interactions and accuracy with spatial datasets, emphasizing the need for better tool and prompt design for reproducibility.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

### [17] [Pruning as a Game: Equilibrium-Driven Sparsification of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22106)
*Zubair Shah,Noaman Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new perspective for neural network pruning by viewing it as a competitive equilibrium among model components, leading to natural sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled and interpretable approach for neural network pruning, addressing the limitations of heuristic or regularization-based methods.

Method: Models neural network pruning as a continuous non-cooperative game, where components (e.g., weights or neurons) optimize their participation balancing contribution and redundancy.

Result: The proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs in standard benchmarks and explains pruning as a natural outcome of player equilibrium.

Conclusion: This work provides a theory-driven, interpretable alternative to traditional pruning methods, leveraging equilibrium phenomena for efficient sparsity.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biologically inspired learning rule for neural networks that eliminates global backpropagation and offers reduced computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency in neural network training and enable energy-efficient learning suitable for edge devices.

Method: The authors introduced a simplified predictive local learning rule integrated into an extreme learning machine (ELM), avoiding matrix inversion and using sparse, binary-driven weight updates triggered by prediction errors.

Result: The method reduces training complexity from O(M³) to O(M) while maintaining comparable accuracy with ELM. An FPGA implementation showed significant reductions in computational and memory requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed design is effective for energy-efficient online learning and shows potential for deployment on low-cost edge devices.

Abstract: We propose a simplified, biologically inspired predictive local learning rule that eliminates the need for global backpropagation in conventional neural networks and membrane integration in event-based training. Weight updates are triggered only on prediction errors and are performed using sparse, binary-driven vector additions. We integrate this rule into an extreme learning machine (ELM), replacing the conventional computationally intensive matrix inversion. Compared to standard ELM, our approach reduces the complexity of the training from O(M^3) to O(M), in terms of M nodes in the hidden layer, while maintaining comparable accuracy (within 3.6% and 2.0% degradation on training and test datasets, respectively). We demonstrate an FPGA implementation and compare it with existing studies, showing significant reductions in computational and memory requirements. This design demonstrates strong potential for energy-efficient online learning on low-cost edge devices.

*Hannah Atmer,Yuan Yao,Thiemo Voigt,Stefanos Kaxiras*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency affect the energy efficiency and performance of large language model inference, emphasizing prefill and decode phase differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the rising energy costs and environmental impact of deploying large language models, necessitating designs for energy-efficient hardware accelerators.

Method: The study uses combined simulation methodologies: OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array intensity, to evaluate SRAM size and operating frequency impacts.

Result: The findings reveal that SRAM size predominantly influences total energy usage, with high operating frequencies reducing latency but limited by memory bandwidth. An optimal configuration of high frequency (1200MHz-1400MHz) and small buffer size (32KB-64KB) achieves the best energy-delay trade-off.

Conclusion: Optimal design for LLM accelerators should balance high compute frequency and small SRAM buffer size to enhance energy efficiency without hitting memory bandwidth bottlenecks.

Abstract: Energy consumption dictates the cost and environmental impact of deploying Large Language Models. This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.

*Nathan Stringham,Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori,Xinyuan Yan,Zhichao Xu,Bei Wang,Ana Marasović*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates why previous attempts to teach users about LLM failure patterns to reduce overreliance have not fully succeeded. It identifies shortcomings in existing methods and proposes ways to improve teaching effectiveness, including better automated failure-discovery methods and new evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of users relying overly on LLMs even for tasks where the models are error-prone, such as basic arithmetic. The authors aim to understand and improve current approaches to mitigate this overreliance.

Method: The paper examines failure patterns in LLMs by grouping instances based on meta-labels, testing predictions, and flagging error-prone groups. It also evaluates prompting and embedding-based methods for identifying failure patterns and introduces a user study with a new metric to measure teaching effectiveness.

Result: Failure patterns do exist, but current approaches to surface these patterns for user education produce mixed results. However, using a new metric to teach users about failure patterns shows a positive effect in reducing overreliance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that teaching users about LLM failure patterns has the potential to mitigate overreliance. However, success depends on improving automated failure-discovery methods and adopting more effective evaluation metrics.

Abstract: People use large language models (LLMs) when they should not. This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.
  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.

### [21] [Morality is Contextual: Learning Interpretable Moral Contexts from Human Data with Probabilistic Clustering and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21439)
*Geoffroy Morlat,Marceau Nahon,Augustin Chartouny,Raja Chatila,Ismael T. Freire,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces COMETH, a framework for modeling moral evaluations by integrating human judgments, language models, and context learning to predict acceptability of actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how context shapes moral evaluations of actions remains a complex challenge in artificial intelligence, especially when actions are ambiguous.

Method: COMETH combines a probabilistic context learner with an LLM-based semantic abstraction, creating contextual moral predictions based on human judgment distributions. It processes actions via an LLM filter, embeddings, and clustering before feature learning and likelihood modeling for explanation and generalization.

Result: COMETH delivers predictions that align approximately 60% with human majority judgments, doubling the alignment compared to end-to-end LLM prompting, while also extracting explanatory contextual features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a structured, interpretable, and empirical approach to modeling moral context-sensitive evaluations and outperforms traditional LLM prompting methods both in accuracy and transparency.

Abstract: Moral actions are judged not only by their outcomes but by the context in which they occur. We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies humor in large language models (LLMs) using the Japanese game "Oogiri" and introduces datasets (Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus) to evaluate humor performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand what makes responses funny to humans, addressing current limitations in datasets such as small candidate pools, biases in ratings, and lack of objective funniness metrics.

Method: Developed Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus with diverse prompts and responses rated by unbiased human judges; performed linguistic factor analysis on funniness and derived objective metrics for humor evaluation.

Result: Found linguistic factors associated with funniness; state-of-the-art LLMs come close to human performance in humor tasks, with improvements achieved through insight-augmented prompting.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous benchmark for humor understanding in LLMs, facilitating improvement in their creative thinking and humor-generation capabilities.

Abstract: Humor is a salient testbed for human-like creative thinking in large language models (LLMs). We study humor using the Japanese creative response game Oogiri, in which participants produce witty responses to a given prompt, and ask the following research question: What makes such responses funny to humans? Previous work has offered only limited reliable means to answer this question. Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments. Subsequently, we benchmark a range of LLMs and human baselines in Oogiri-Master, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models approach human performance and that insight-augmented prompting improves the model performance. Our results provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs.

*Changzhi Sun,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-theoretic framework for memory management in large language models, aiming to improve the long-term utility of memory decisions under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory management in large language models relies on heuristics, which fail to address the uncertain and delayed consequences of memory decisions, limiting their effectiveness for long-term interaction and personalization.

Method: The paper proposes DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a framework that separates memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage. The framework uses value functions and uncertainty estimators to evaluate decisions based on their long-term utility and risk.

Result: The framework offers a structured approach to memory management that highlights the limitations of heuristic methods and emphasizes decision-making under uncertainty.

Conclusion: DAM presents a principled way to address memory management challenges in large language models, providing a foundation for future work on creating uncertainty-aware systems and improving long-term decision-making.

Abstract: External memory is a key component of modern large language model (LLM) systems, enabling long-term interaction and personalization. Despite its importance, memory management is still largely driven by hand-designed heuristics, offering little insight into the long-term and uncertain consequences of memory decisions. In practice, choices about what to read or write shape future retrieval and downstream behavior in ways that are difficult to anticipate. We argue that memory management should be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where the utility of memory is delayed and dependent on future interactions. To this end, we propose DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a decision-theoretic framework that decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. Within this architecture, candidate operations are evaluated via value functions and uncertainty estimators, enabling an aggregate policy to arbitrate decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk. Our contribution is not a new algorithm, but a principled reframing that clarifies the limitations of heuristic approaches and provides a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.

*Emmy Liu,Varun Gangal,Chelsea Zou,Xiaoqi Huang,Michael Yu,Alex Chang,Zhuofu Tao,Sachin Kumar,Steven Y. Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified definition of hallucination in neural language models and proposes benchmarks for better evaluation and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the persistent problem of hallucination in language models by synthesizing various definitions into a unified framework and offering solutions to improve their evaluation and modeling accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a unified definition of hallucination based on inaccuracies in internal world modeling that can manifest as observable errors. They argue for benchmarks using synthetic world models to evaluate hallucination.

Result: The unified view simplifies the classification of hallucinations and proposes an evaluation framework that incorporates synthetic environments to improve world modeling in language models.

Conclusion: A unified definition of hallucination highlights critical evaluation points, clarifies the distinction from other errors, and lays a foundation for improved benchmarks and mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Despite numerous attempts to solve the issue of hallucination since the inception of neural language models, it remains a problem in even frontier large language models today. Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.
  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed "world" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of research on small non-English-focused language models, particularly for efficient use in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The model uses a two-stage pre-training strategy: balanced multilingual training followed by English enrichment, allowing performance gains across 12 languages.

Result: Gamayun surpasses competing language models like LLaMA3.2-1B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on multilingual benchmarks with significantly lesser training resources.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results, especially in Russian language tasks, proving the efficiency of the proposed approach for smaller multilingual models.

Abstract: We present Gamayun, a 1.5B-parameter multilingual language model trained entirely from scratch on 2.5T tokens. Designed for efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments, Gamayun addresses the lack of research on small non-English-centric LLMs by adopting a novel two-stage pre-training strategy: balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, followed by high-quality English enrichment to transfer performance gains across languages. Our model supports 12 languages, with special focus on Russian. Despite a significantly smaller training budget than comparable models, Gamayun outperforms LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) on all considered benchmarks, and surpasses Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on a wide range of English and multilingual tasks. It matches or exceeds Qwen3 (36T tokens) on most tasks outside advanced STEM, achieving state-of-the-art results in Russian, including the MERA benchmark, among the models of comparable size (1-2B parameters).

TL;DR: The study investigates how sample polarities affect RLVR training and proposes the A3PO method for token-level advantage shaping in reasoning models, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning capabilities of large models by systematically understanding how sample polarities impact RLVR training and leveraging these insights.

Method: Analyzed the effect of positive and negative sample polarities on RLVR training dynamics, introduced the Adaptive and Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping method (A3PO), and conducted experiments on reasoning benchmarks.

Result: A3PO demonstrated enhanced performance across five reasoning benchmarks by precisely allocating advantage signals based on sample polarity.

Conclusion: Adaptive token-level shaping of advantage values notably benefits RLVR training, optimizing reasoning models' ability to explore and sharpen reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are typically trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to enhance their reasoning abilities. In this paradigm, policies are updated using both positive and negative self-generated rollouts, which correspond to distinct sample polarities. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation into how these sample polarities affect RLVR training dynamics and behaviors. We find that positive samples sharpen existing correct reasoning patterns, while negative samples encourage exploration of new reasoning paths. We further explore how adjusting the advantage values of positive and negative samples at both the sample level and the token level affects RLVR training. Based on these insights, we propose an Adaptive and Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping method for Policy Optimization, namely A3PO, that more precisely allocates advantage signals to key tokens across different polarities. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents HIC-Bench, a framework to categorize and evaluate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) as either Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) or Defective Hallucinations (DH), aiming to balance creativity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs are often viewed negatively as errors, but some may hold creative or scientific value, which is underexplored in the current research.

Method: The paper introduces HIC-Bench with structured assessment metrics combining Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) and dimensions specific to hallucinations, assesses performance across 10 scientific domains, and utilizes an optimization tool (Dynamic Hallucination Prompt) for better outputs.

Result: HIC-Bench revealed a nonlinear relationship between creative (IH) and defective (DH) outputs, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be concurrently optimized in LLMs.

Conclusion: Hallucinations in LLMs can fuel creativity and scientific innovation, and HIC-Bench provides a methodological platform for evaluating and leveraging this potential.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are commonly regarded as errors to be minimized. However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) framework for modeling conversational behaviors using causal inference, enabling prediction of speech acts and reasoning chains in duplex dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human conversations rely on implicit chains of thoughts and causal pathways, which are essential for creating natural full-duplex interactive systems.

Method: The framework employs a hierarchical labeling scheme to predict communicative intents and speech acts by capturing their causal and temporal dependencies using a multimodal transformer and a hybrid dataset.

Result: Experiments demonstrate effective behavior detection, interpretable reasoning chains, and dynamic predictions for duplex dialogues using synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: GoT provides a robust structure for reasoning over conversational behaviors and establishes a foundation for future benchmarking of spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

*Jing Han,Binwei Yan,Tianyu Guo,Zheyuan Bai,Mengyu Zheng,Hanting Chen,Ying Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for agent tasks by decomposing roles and proposing the Mixture-of-Roles framework with specialized Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methodologies for large language models to perform agent tasks are inefficient, with PEFT strategies remaining underexplored.

Method: A Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework is introduced, comprising LoRA groups for reasoner, executor, and summarizer roles. These are fine-tuned using a multi-role data generation pipeline from public datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies across various LLMs and benchmarks confirm the framework's effectiveness in performing agent tasks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the success of role decomposition and the MoR framework in achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning for agent tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to facilitate agent tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies for agent remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce three key strategies for PEFT in agent tasks: 1) Inspired by the increasingly dominant Reason+Action paradigm, we first decompose the capabilities necessary for the agent tasks into three distinct roles: reasoner, executor, and summarizer. The reasoner is responsible for comprehending the user's query and determining the next role based on the execution trajectory. The executor is tasked with identifying the appropriate functions and parameters to invoke. The summarizer conveys the distilled information from conversations back to the user. 2) We then propose the Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework, which comprises three specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) groups, each designated to fulfill a distinct role. By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification. We conduct extensive experiments and thorough ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Md. Rakibul Islam,Most. Sharmin Sultana Samu,Md. Zahid Hossain,Farhad Uz Zaman,Md. Kamrozzaman Bhuiyan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting AI-generated text in Bengali using five transformer-based models, showing fine-tuning significantly enhances detection accuracy to around 91%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of AI-generated text, maintaining authenticity and preventing malicious misuse in the Bengali language—an underexplored area—is crucial due to its complex structure and rich vocabulary.

Method: The study evaluates five transformer-based models (XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base, MultilingualBERT-Base) using both zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches to differentiate between human-written and AI-generated Bengali text.

Result: Zero-shot evaluation showed near chance-level accuracy (~50%), while fine-tuning boosted performance significantly. XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and MultilingualBERT achieved ~91% in accuracy and F1-score, while IndicBERT lagged behind.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of fine-tuning for Bengali text detection, advancing the field and laying the groundwork for more effective systems to identify AI-generated content in this language.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can produce text that closely resembles human writing. This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.

### [31] [Do Latent Tokens Think? A Causal and Adversarial Analysis of Chain-of-Continuous-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21711)
*Yuyi Zhang,Boyu Tang,Tianjie Ju,Sufeng Duan,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques latent tokens in reasoning tasks for large language models, especially focusing on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), showing they rely on shortcuts rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the internal mechanisms of latent tokens used in reasoning tasks, particularly their reliability and effectiveness in encoding genuine reasoning processes.

Method: The study examines COCONUT using two approaches: perturbation experiments on tokens to test their sensitivity, and shortcut experiments assessing model performance in biased/out-of-distribution scenarios.

Result: Experiments show that COCONUT tokens lack critical reasoning information, are minimally sensitive to perturbations, and exploit dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark scores without true reasoning.

Conclusion: COCONUT is revealed as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism, generating convincing outputs via shortcuts rather than engaging in faithful reasoning.

Abstract: Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

*Rui Ke,Jiahui Xu,Shenghao Yang,Kuang Wang,Feng Jiang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATCH, a framework addressing challenges in theme detection in dialogues by improving topic consistency, user preference alignment, and topic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current theme detection methods which struggle with sparse data and fail to reflect cross-dialogue consistency and user-centric themes.

Method: Proposed CATCH framework with context-aware topic representation, preference-guided clustering, and hierarchical theme generation for better theme detection.

Result: CATCH outperforms existing methods on the DSTC-12 benchmark using 8B LLM, demonstrating improved theme clustering and topic generation quality.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses theme detection challenges and offers a robust solution for user-centric dialogue theme identification.

Abstract: Theme detection is a fundamental task in user-centric dialogue systems, aiming to identify the latent topic of each utterance without relying on predefined schemas. Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric evaluation framework targeting Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic translation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in assessing dialect-specific errors in Arabic Machine Translation systems, which hinder progress in improving translation quality.

Method: The authors propose Ara-HOPE, including a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol for systematic evaluation, comparing results across three MT systems.

Result: Ara-HOPE successfully highlights systematic differences between the MT systems, showing persistent challenges in handling dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation.

Conclusion: Ara-HOPE sets a new benchmark for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides insights for enhancing dialect-aware translation systems.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic (DA-MSA) translation is a challenging task in Machine Translation (MT) due to significant lexical, syntactic, and semantic divergences between Arabic dialects and MSA. Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks struggle to capture dialect-specific MT errors, hindering progress in translation assessment. This paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework designed to systematically address these challenges. The framework includes a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol. Through comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200), Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between these systems. The results show that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation. Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.

TL;DR: The SciCap project aimed to enhance scientific figure captioning through domain-specific training, collaborations, curated datasets, and annual challenges, addressing challenges with LLMs and outlining future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to improve scientific figure captioning using domain-specific approaches, leveraging advances in AI and large-scale collaborations.

Method: SciCap developed domain-specific models, curated datasets, performed evaluations, launched challenges, and created interactive tools for figure captioning.

Result: The project grew to establish new benchmarks in scientific figure-captioning, initiating multi-institution collaborations and advancing methodologies.

Conclusion: SciCap achieved notable progress in scientific figure captioning and identified unsolved challenges for future exploration in the field.

Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

*Vitthal Bhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines cultural bias in large language models and advocates for involving stakeholders in assessments to address societal impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze recent literature evaluating cultural bias in NLP and provide observations for researchers to address cross-cultural bias effectively.

Method: Review of 20 papers published in 2025 focusing on cultural bias in NLP, inspired by previous work.

Result: Set of observations provided to help NLP researchers conceptualize cultural bias and evaluate its consequences.

Conclusion: Calls for robust assessments of societal impacts of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

Abstract: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.
  Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system called Method Decoration (DeMe) for enhancing IoT systems using LLMs, enabling adaptive and context-aware task execution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT systems relying on LLMs face difficulties in adapting to dynamic environments and unseen situations; current systems depend on fixed logic that lacks flexibility.

Method: The DeMe framework modifies the method-generation process of LLMs by integrating decorations based on goals, learned experience, and environmental feedback, avoiding hardcoded rules.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DeMe’s ability to generate context-aware and adaptive task methods, ensuring better performance in dynamic and faulty conditions.

Conclusion: Method Decoration addresses adaptability and safety challenges in IoT systems, allowing them to operate effectively under changing environmental conditions.

Abstract: Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

TL;DR: The study introduces Quicker, a clinical decision support system using large language models to automate evidence synthesis and improve clinical decision-making efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare professionals face challenges in integrating clinical evidence into practice due to workload, time constraints, and complex processes, necessitating tools for automated evidence synthesis.

Method: Quicker is designed as a fully automated system that synthesizes evidence from questions to clinical recommendations, integrating user interfaces and tools, and evaluated through the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset.

Result: Quicker demonstrated strong performance in question decomposition, literature retrieval and screening, human reviewer assistance, and generated recommendations surpassing clinician comprehensiveness. Collaboration reduced recommendation development time to 20-40 minutes.

Conclusion: Quicker is a promising tool to support physicians in making faster, accurate, and reliable evidence-based clinical decisions, showcasing significant potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach integrating large language models (LLMs) with graph-structured knowledge for reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control, yielding superior results in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning accuracy and depth in the tobacco pest and disease domain by integrating structured domain knowledge into LLMs.

Method: The approach uses GraphRAG-based integration of a knowledge graph with relevant domain information into the reasoning process, Transformer architecture for inference, a GNN for node representation, and a fine-tuned ChatGLM-based backbone.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving improved accuracy and depth in multi-hop and comparative reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-specific knowledge with LLMs in a structured way can bolster reasoning capabilities, especially in complex scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlignAR, a method for Arabic-English sentence alignment, and provides a new dataset featuring complex legal and literary texts, achieving significant improvement over traditional alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of high-quality Arabic-English parallel corpora for Machine Translation research, especially in capturing complex text alignments beyond simple one-to-one mappings.

Method: The authors developed AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and tested it using a newly curated Arabic-English dataset comprising challenging complex texts.

Result: The study showed that traditional alignment methods perform poorly on datasets with reduced one-to-one mappings, while LLM-based methods achieved an F1-score of 85.5%, outperforming previous methods by 9%.

Conclusion: AlignAR and the complex Arabic-English dataset set a higher benchmark for evaluating alignment methods, emphasizing the robustness of LLM-based approaches. The resources are publicly available for future research.

Abstract: High-quality parallel corpora are essential for Machine Translation (MT) research and translation teaching. However, Arabic-English resources remain scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings. In this paper, we present AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and a new Arabic-English dataset comprising complex legal and literary texts. Our evaluation demonstrates that "Easy" datasets lack the discriminatory power to fully assess alignment methods. By reducing one-to-one mappings in our "Hard" subset, we exposed the limitations of traditional alignment methods. In contrast, LLM-based approaches demonstrated superior robustness, achieving an overall F1-score of 85.5%, a 9% improvement over previous methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents HeartBench, a benchmark for evaluating anthropomorphic intelligence in Chinese LLMs, focusing on social, emotional, and ethical dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in anthropomorphic intelligence of LLMs, specifically in the Chinese cultural context, due to lack of evaluation frameworks and socio-emotional data.

Method: Developed HeartBench, a framework structured with a taxonomy of intelligence dimensions, using rubric-based, case-specific evaluation, and collaboration with clinical experts.

Result: Evaluation of 13 LLMs showed a capped performance with leading models achieving only 60% of the ideal score, and significant difficulty in handling emotional and ethical complexity.

Conclusion: HeartBench offers a standardized evaluation for anthropomorphic AI and a blueprint for creating human-aligned data for improved development.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

TL;DR: TimeBill is an inference framework optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for time-critical tasks by predicting execution time and adjusting its internal processes to adhere to time constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty in ensuring LLMs generate timely and accurate responses in systems with tight deadlines due to challenges in modeling execution times and inefficiencies in fixed key-value cache eviction methods.

Method: The authors developed TimeBill, a framework incorporating a response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE). They adjust the key-value cache eviction ratio dynamically based on time predictions and budgets.

Result: Experiments show TimeBill improves task completion rates and sustains response performance under various conditions and overrun strategies.

Conclusion: TimeBill enhances LLMs for time-sensitive applications by balancing efficiency and performance, confirming its potential for critical systems with strict time constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to handle copyrighted content responsibly, revealing significant deficiencies and proposing a defense framework for better compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about LVLMs potentially infringing on copyrights when interacting with copyrighted visual content like book excerpts, code, music lyrics, and news articles.

Method: The authors create a benchmark dataset of 50,000 query-content pairs (both with and without copyright notices) to systematically evaluate LVLMs' copyright compliance. They also propose a novel tool-augmented defense framework.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LVLMs fail to adequately recognize and respect copyright notices and boundaries when interacting with copyrighted content.

Conclusion: Improvement is necessary in LVLMs for better copyright recognition and compliance, emphasizing the need for ethical and lawful development in LVLM technologies.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CricBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on cricket data tasks, revealing significant gaps in handling domain-specific nuances and multilingual requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of advanced statistical tools for cricket analytics and evaluate LLMs' abilities to handle specialized and multilingual sports data.

Method: A Gold Standard dataset was curated with expert-generated complex SQL queries in English and Hindi, followed by evaluating six state-of-the-art models on the dataset under a strict evaluation protocol.

Result: The open-weights model DeepSeek R1 outperformed proprietary models but still exhibited accuracy drops compared to general benchmarks. Hindi code-mixed queries performed well or better than English.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle in specialized and multilingual domains, signaling potential for further improvements, with Hindi shown as a promising language for specialized SQL tasks.

Abstract: Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a "Gold Standard" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores automatic statute prediction by predicting relevant statutes for a given case description and accompanies predictions with human-understandable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create Legal AI systems that assist lawyers and legal question answering through statute prediction, which requires human-understandable explanations for better acceptance.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: Attention-over-Sentences (AoS), a supervised method using smaller sentence transformer models, and LLMPrompt, a zero-shot approach with larger language models using standard and Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques.

Result: Both methods demonstrated statute prediction capabilities and produced human-intelligible explanations, evaluated across datasets using automated and human assessment methods.

Conclusion: These techniques improve statute prediction and explanation quality, contributing to legal AI systems' usability and effectiveness for application purposes.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term "statute" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes sparse verification methods to enhance speculative decoding efficiency for autoregressive language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational bottleneck in the verification stage of speculative decoding for language models, especially in complex scenarios like long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts models.

Method: Used sparse techniques to optimize attention, FFN, and MoE components during verification; also employed inter-draft token and inter-layer reuse strategies to reduce redundancy.

Result: Experiments show improved efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse verification framework reduces verification computational cost while maintaining desired acceptance lengths and robust performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive language model inference by verifying multiple draft tokens in parallel. However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.

### [46] [SWE-RM: Execution-free Feedback For Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21919)
*KaShun Shum,Binyuan Hui,Jiawei Chen,Lei Zhang,X. W.,Jiaxi Yang,Yuzhen Huang,Junyang Lin,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a scalable reward model, SWE-RM, to improve coding agents' performance in test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL) without relying on execution-based feedback. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the limitations of execution-based feedback—sparse and dependency on unit test cases—and explore execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering agents, which remains underexplored.

Method: Comprehensive experiments were conducted to identify key training metrics for RL reward models such as classification accuracy and calibration. A mixture-of-experts architecture was utilized in SWE-RM with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference.

Result: SWE-RM significantly improved TTS and RL performance metrics for software engineering agents. This includes notable accuracy increases in state-of-the-art models Qwen3-Coder-Flash and Qwen3-Coder-Max on SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks.

Conclusion: The reward model SWE-RM effectively enhances the capabilities of SWE agents in both TTS and RL. This demonstrates the potential of execution-free feedback for improving coding agent performance while setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Execution-based feedback like unit testing is widely used in the development of coding agents through test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

### [47] [Broken Words, Broken Performance: Effect of Tokenization on Performance of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21933)
*Sachin Pawar,Manoj Apte,Kshitij Jadhav,Girish Keshav Palshikar,Nitin Ramrakhiyani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how tokenization in large language models (LLMs), where natural words may be broken into multiple tokens, impacts model performance. It proposes penalty functions to quantify this effect and validates the hypothesis across various NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand whether breaking natural words into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary in LLMs negatively affects their performance on NLP tasks.

Method: The authors propose penalty functions to measure tokenization flaws in texts and evaluate statistical significance through experiments on different NLP tasks and LLMs.

Result: The hypothesis that breaking natural words harms LLM performance is statistically validated across multiple NLP tasks and a range of LLMs.

Conclusion: Tokenization choices play a critical role in LLM performance, and developing better tokenization methods could improve NLP outcomes in LLMs.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first step in training any Large Language Model (LLM), where the text is split into a sequence of tokens as per the model's fixed vocabulary. This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of "natural" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits "martial" into "mart" and "ial"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.

*Tal Halevi,Yarden Tzach,Ronit D. Gross,Shalom Rosner,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how the self-attention mechanism in BERT-12 processes information, focusing on token similarity and attention specialization across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantitative mechanisms of self-attention in advanced NLP models to highlight its underlying learning processes.

Method: Analysis of BERT-12 architecture with a focus on attention maps, context similarity matrices, vector space structure, and token similarities between layers and heads.

Result: Attention maps in final layers focus on semantic segmentation with separator tokens; layers progress from long-range to short-range token similarities based on linguistic characteristics; specific heads exhibit unique token pair focus.

Conclusion: Self-attention heads exhibit diverse linguistic specializations and structural shifts across layers, emphasizing their critical role in NLP model processing and semantic text segmentation.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, facilitating the development of advanced language-learning machines. Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.

### [49] [Context as a Tool: Context Management for Long-Horizon SWE-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22087)
*Shukai Liu,Jian Yang,Bo Jiang,Yizhi Li,Jinyang Guo,Xianglong Liu,Bryan Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAT, a context management paradigm for agents in software engineering tasks involving long-horizon interactions. It addresses issues of context explosion by integrating structured, callable context maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agents face challenges like context explosion and degraded reasoning during long-running tasks due to insufficient context management. This paper tackles these issues to ensure better performance in SWE tasks.

Method: The authors propose CAT, which integrates context management as a callable tool in agents' decision-making. They introduce a structured context workspace and train a model, SWE-Compressor, using a trajectory-level supervision framework called CAT-GENERATOR.

Result: The SWE-Compressor demonstrated a 57.6% solved rate on SWE-Bench-Verified and significantly outperformed other approaches while maintaining effective reasoning under limited context budgets.

Conclusion: CAT establishes a proactive and organized context management system, showing strong potential for improving agents’ performance and scalability on repository-scale SWE tasks.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models have recently shown strong potential on real-world software engineering (SWE) tasks that require long-horizon interaction with repository-scale codebases. However, most existing agents rely on append-only context maintenance or passively triggered compression heuristics, which often lead to context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-running interactions. We propose CAT, a new context management paradigm that elevates context maintenance to a callable tool integrated into the decision-making process of agents. CAT formalizes a structured context workspace consisting of stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, and high-fidelity short-term interactions, and enables agents to proactively compress historical trajectories into actionable summaries at appropriate milestones. To support context management for SWE-agents, we propose a trajectory-level supervision framework, CAT-GENERATOR, based on an offline data construction pipeline that injects context-management actions into complete interaction trajectories. Using this framework, we train a context-aware model, SWE-Compressor. Experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that SWE-Compressor reaches a 57.6% solved rate and significantly outperforms ReAct-based agents and static compression baselines, while maintaining stable and scalable long-horizon reasoning under a bounded context budget.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TrGLUE, a novel benchmark specifically for evaluating natural language understanding (NLU) tasks in Turkish, alongside SentiTurca for sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of a proper benchmark for Turkish NLU tasks, which limits comprehensive performance evaluation of language models in Turkish.

Method: TrGLUE uses Turkish-native corpora, a semi-automated annotation pipeline combining large language models (LLMs), model agreement checks, and human validation to ensure linguistic accuracy and scalability. Fine-tuning and evaluation codes are provided for transformer-based models.

Result: TrGLUE is a comprehensive Turkish NLU benchmark that mirrors GLUE-style evaluations and avoids direct translation artifacts, ensuring linguistic naturalness and robustness.

Conclusion: TrGLUE establishes a standardized evaluation framework for Turkish NLU tasks, facilitates research in this area, and demonstrates the potential of creating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

### [51] [Understanding Virality: A Rubric based Vision-Language Model Framework for Short-Form Edutainment Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21402)
*Arnav Gupta,Gurekas Singh Sahney,Hardik Rathi,Abhishek Chandwani,Ishaan Gupta,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops a new framework to evaluate short-form videos using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for predicting real audience engagement, surpassing the limitations of traditional metrics like SSIM or FID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video evaluation tools fail to effectively measure human engagement, as they focus primarily on visual and semantic fidelity rather than the specific audiovisual attributes driving audience response.

Method: The authors propose a data-driven evaluation approach that extracts features using Vision-Language Models, clusters interpretative audiovisual factors, and employs regression to predict viewer engagement on a curated dataset of YouTube Shorts.

Result: The experiments demonstrated strong correlations between the predicted and actual engagement, revealing that the proposed approach is interpretable, scalable, and more aligned with audience engagement compared to traditional quality metrics.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a human-centered, multimodal approach to video evaluation, offering a more robust and explainable method for understanding how audiovisual content drives engagement.

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

### [52] [A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21414)
*Christina Liu,Alan Q. Wang,Joy Hsu,Jiajun Wu,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), a method enhancing medical image analysis by composing vision-language model (VLM)-selected tools using a neural network instead of text, improving interpretability and prediction in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language model (VLM)-based frameworks for tool use struggle with medical image understanding due to their reliance on text-based composition, which is insufficient for spatially-localized, clinically meaningful features.

Method: TBF employs a medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox of clinically-relevant feature extractors and uses a neural network-based Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM) to fuse and compute the outputs of these tools for final prediction.

Result: TBF demonstrates superior or comparable performance to leading classifiers, VLMs, and other frameworks in medical imaging tasks, particularly excelling in data-limited situations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances medical imaging predictions and interpretability, offering a practical system for improved analysis in disciplines like histopathology and dermatology.

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes. Our code is available at https://github.com/christinaliu2020/tool-bottleneck-framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subspace clustering methods face scalability issues; SDSNet proposes a deep clustering framework that achieves $O(n)$ complexity while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational bottlenecks in scalable subspace clustering, particularly from $O(n^3)$ affinity matrix construction and spectral decomposition.

Method: SDSNet achieves scalability using (1) landmark-based approximation to avoid full affinity matrix computation, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction and self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations.

Result: SDSNet demonstrates comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed SDSNet represents a scalable and efficient approach to subspace clustering, offering reduced complexity with preserved clustering performance.

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.

Conclusion: Deep learning is effective for image classification in microscopy and can work with cost-efficient digital holographic devices after performance tuning.

Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.

*Mo Wang,Junfeng Xia,Wenhao Ye,Enyu Liu,Kaining Peng,Jianfeng Feng,Quanying Liu,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIM-Brain is an atlas-free, efficient fMRI foundation model offering superior performance while reducing computational and memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing atlas-based methods (loss of spatial details, large data need) and atlas-free methods (high computational intensity) in fMRI analysis.

Method: SLIM-Brain uses a two-stage design: temporal extractor ranks salient data windows; a hierarchical encoder processes only these selected windows, saving resources.

Result: SLIM-Brain achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple fMRI benchmarks, requiring significantly less data, training sessions, and GPU memory than traditional models.

Conclusion: The proposed SLIM-Brain model successfully balances efficiency and performance, making it a promising approach for scalable and precise fMRI analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCAD integrates global features and adaptive compression to enhance anomaly detection, resulting in faster convergence and superior AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve anomaly detection in scenarios with limited anomalous data and address inefficiencies in existing methods.

Method: Introduced Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD), which combines global features and reconstruction models with an adaptive compression mechanism.

Result: CCAD outperformed state-of-the-art methods in AUC and achieved faster convergence. A reorganized DAGM 2007 dataset was also contributed.

Conclusion: CCAD effectively addresses domain shift and training inefficiencies in anomaly detection, proving to be a promising improvement over existing techniques.

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISIC MultiAnnot++, the largest publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, containing segmentation masks, metadata, and curated partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale publicly available datasets for multi-annotator medical image segmentation in dermoscopic skin lesion imaging.

Method: The authors curated the ISIC MultiAnnot++ dataset with 17,684 segmentation masks across 14,967 dermoscopic images, including metadata on annotators and tools, and provided partitioning and analysis.

Result: A large, publicly available dataset was created with multi-annotator segmentation data and metadata, supporting advanced research such as annotator preference modeling.

Conclusion: ISIC MultiAnnot++ facilitates research on segmentation and annotator-specific topics, addressing the gap in multi-annotator datasets.

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

*Suncheng Xiang,Xiaoyang Wang,Junjie Jiang,Hejia Wang,Dahong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Gated Progressive Fusion network to enhance colonoscopic polyp re-identification by refining semantic information for better small-object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of matching colonoscopic polyp images across different views and cameras for improved colorectal cancer diagnosis, specifically aiming to improve accuracy for small polyps.

Method: The paper proposes a Gated Progressive Fusion network that selectively fuses multi-level features using gates and progressively refines semantic information through multi-level interactions.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion strategy outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal re-identification models.

Conclusion: The multimodal fusion approach significantly improves polyp re-identification performance, particularly for small objects important in medical imaging and diagnosis.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

*Xinzhe Xie,Buyu Guo,Bolin Li,Shuangyan He,Yanzhen Gu,Qingyan Jiang,Peiliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFF is a generative framework for multi-focus image fusion, combining deterministic fusion with generative restoration to enhance focus accuracy and eliminate artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing multi-focus image fusion algorithms, specifically uncertain focus estimation and edge artifacts.

Method: GMFF operates in two stages: deterministic fusion with StackMFF V4 and generative restoration using IFControlNet to reconstruct missing focal planes and improve edge quality.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance, particularly for complex multi-focal content.

Conclusion: GMFF represents a significant advance in multi-focus image fusion, offering improved fusion quality and practical applicability in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

### [61] [SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507)
*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-video generation models show progress but struggle with generating socially coherent behavior. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess social reasoning in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack the ability to infer social behavior, such as intentions and emotions, which are crucial for realistic interactions.

Method: A benchmark based on social cognition paradigms is developed, using a training-free agent-based pipeline to evaluate video generation systems with a focus on social reasoning.

Result: Large-scale study shows that state-of-the-art systems excel in surface-level realism but underperform in understanding intention, beliefs, and social behaviors.

Conclusion: Despite technological advances, there is a substantial gap in generating socially coherent videos, underscoring the need for improved reasoning mechanisms in future models.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies for multimodal chest X-ray analysis, achieving better performance with reduced parameters compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of fine-tuning large vision-language models for chest X-ray analysis, exploring efficient approaches like parameter-efficient training without losing performance.

Method: The study uses PET strategies including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset. It evaluates the performance under a fixed parameter budget and conducts external validation on the CheXpert dataset.

Result: Under PET, AUROC scores improved significantly (0.892-0.908) compared to full fine-tuning (0.770) with a 40-fold reduction in parameters. External validation showed scalability, while PET-based models used fewer parameters but had calibration issues.

Conclusion: Frozen encoder strategies significantly improve computational efficiency and discrimination in chest X-ray analysis. However, clinical deployment requires addressing calibration issues through post-hoc methods.

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol for robust detection of AI-generated images under common post-processing transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust AI-generated image detectors that perform well under post-processing transformations and avoid misleading robustness estimates caused by retuning thresholds.

Method: Introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol with decision thresholds selected on clean data and tested across degradations using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid model.

Result: CNNs are better for clean photos but weak under compression, ViTs excel under semantic pattern recognition even with compression, and the hybrid approach performs well across different domains.

Conclusion: Fixed-threshold evaluation identifies gaps in robustness and guides deployment: use CNNs for clean photos, ViTs for compressed images, and hybrids for versatile screening including art and graphics.

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

*Puyun Wang,Kaimin Yu,Huayang He,Xianyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset for underwater 3D imaging using polarization. The dataset allows fair comparisons of various algorithms in turbid environments and supports multiple vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of diverse and controlled datasets for evaluating polarization-based underwater 3D imaging methods, which hinders fair comparisons among algorithms.

Method: A new benchmark dataset MuS-Polar3D was created with quantitatively controlled scattering conditions, covering 42 objects in different viewpoints. Additionally, a two-stage pipeline (descattering followed by 3D reconstruction) is proposed for underwater imaging.

Result: Experimental evaluations under complex scattering conditions demonstrated the benchmark’s utility and recorded a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MuS-Polar3D is the first dataset for turbidity-controlled underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling better reconstruction and fair algorithm benchmarking. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

### [65] [DiverseGRPO: Mitigating Mode Collapse in Image Generation via Diversity-Aware GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21514)
*Henglin Liu,Huijuan Huang,Jing Wang,Chang Liu,Xiu Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the homogenization problem in GRPO-based reinforcement learning frameworks for image generation and proposes methods to improve diversity and creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations in current GRPO techniques that lead to homogenized outputs with reduced visual and semantic diversity, restricting applicability.

Method: The authors propose improvements at the reward modeling and generation levels: distributional creativity bonuses based on semantic grouping, and structure-aware regularization to preserve diversity during early-stage denoising.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 13%–18% improvement in semantic diversity while maintaining high-quality image generation, setting a better balance in the quality-diversity trade-off.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a new benchmark for balancing image quality and diversity in GRPO-based image generation, highlighting the importance of tailored reward modeling and generation regularization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

*Jiayu Li,Rajesh Gangireddy,Samet Akcay,Wei Cheng,Juhua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for hierarchical classification using efficient fine-tuning methods with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Vision-Language Models to hierarchical classification is underexplored, as current methods are costly and produce inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework using two structural objectives, Tree-Path KL Divergence and Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy, integrated with lightweight LoRA adaptation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated improved Full-Path Accuracy and reduced Tree-based Inconsistency Error across benchmarks with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: This framework enables efficient and consistent adaptation of Vision-Language Models to hierarchical classification tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

### [67] [Vision Transformers are Circulant Attention Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21542)
*Dongchen Han,Tianyu Li,Ziyi Wang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Circulant Attention for vision Transformers to replace self-attention, reducing computational complexity to O(N log N) while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational complexity (O(N^2)) of self-attention mechanisms in vision Transformers, which limits their practical applications in high-resolution data.

Method: The authors proposed Circulant Attention, leveraging the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB). Using this efficient matrix structure, the computational cost of attention computation is reduced while retaining its core characteristics.

Result: Circulant Attention achieves O(N log N) complexity and maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Experiments confirmed its effectiveness across various visual tasks.

Conclusion: This study establishes Circulant Attention as a computationally efficient alternative to self-attention in vision Transformers, enabling broader practical use without sacrificing model capacity.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

*Sanghyun Jo,Donghwan Lee,Eunji Jung,Seong Je Oh,Kyungsu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EraseLoRA introduces a framework for object removal in images using a dataset-free approach, combining background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation to prevent unwanted object regeneration and ensure better background reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address challenges in object removal that arise from current methods which fail in preserving background cues and misinterpret non-target foregrounds, leading to unwanted object regeneration.

Method: The method involves two key components: Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE) using multimodal large-language models to divide image elements, and Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA) for optimizing background integration through reconstruction objectives.

Result: EraseLoRA showed improvements over existing dataset-free techniques and achieved competitive outcomes compared to dataset-driven approaches in benchmarks for object removal.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by employing background-aware reasoning and reconstruction, EraseLoRA effectively enhances object removal performance, providing a strong alternative to dataset-driven methods.

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new tasks in intelligent image editing: context-aware object insertion and sponsor-product logo augmentation. New datasets were created to support these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance intelligent image editing by ensuring contextually appropriate object and logo insertions, which is crucial in advertising and digital media.

Method: The researchers propose two tasks: predicting appropriate object categories with generation and placement within a scene; and detecting products for correct brand logo placement. They also provide supporting datasets with annotations.

Result: Two new datasets were developed with specific labels and annotations to improve object insertion and logo augmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Context-appropriate object and logo placement is vital for intelligent editing applications, and the proposed tasks and datasets address this gap.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues of reproducibility and generalizability in AI-generated content (AIGC) image detection and offers solutions by reviewing relevant papers, constructing a dataset, and analyzing detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor reproducibility and insufficient generalizability in AIGC image detection, which hinder practical applications.

Method: The study reviews 7 key papers, builds a lightweight test dataset, and reproduces representative detection methods to identify fundamental challenges.

Result: It identifies root causes such as omission of preprocessing details and overfitting to generator-specific features. Experimental results show performance drops with disrupted features or cross-generator testing.

Conclusion: The research advises better disclosure of experimental details and validation of generalizability to improve reproducibility and application of AIGC detection technologies.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LAid, a novel distillation method that enhances small vision-language models' long-range attention capabilities using weighted attention matching and learnable RoPE modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small branches of vision-language models struggle with effective long-context understanding despite advances in large VLMs, requiring techniques for improved long-range attention transfer.

Method: LAid employs progressive distance-weighted attention matching and learnable RoPE response gain modulation to emphasize longer positional differences and improve position sensitivity dynamically.

Result: Experiments show LAid improves effective context windows up to 3.2 times longer in small models while maintaining or enhancing baseline performance.

Conclusion: LAid offers efficient practical tools for upgrading small vision-language models and theoretical insights into positional understanding during distillation.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the bias in existing metrics using LLMs, which favor their own outputs, and the suboptimal performance of other LLM-free metrics, aiming for a more neutral and effective solution.

Method: The researchers developed the Pearl metric, leveraging a novel mechanism for learning image-caption and caption-caption similarity representations. They also created a large human-annotated dataset to train and test the metric.

Result: Pearl outperformed other LLM-free metrics in various benchmark datasets (e.g., Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, and FOIL) in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: Pearl successfully overcomes LLM bias issues and enhances performance in image captioning metric evaluation, providing a neutral and effective alternative for diverse settings.

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Motivation: Current 3D simulation methods for autonomous driving struggle with balancing high-fidelity rendering, realistic editing, and overcoming artifacts in scenarios like novel view synthesis.

Result: SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view enhancement and 3D vehicle insertion, addressing challenges in photorealistic rendering and scene editing.

Conclusion: SymDrive successfully overcomes limitations of previous methods by providing both photorealistic rendering and controllable scene editing, offering valuable improvements to 3D simulation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment.

In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

*Jian Lang,Rongpei Hong,Ting Zhong,Leiting Chen,Qiang Gao,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALARM leverages a label-free approach and Large Multimodal Model agent self-improvement to detect harmful memes and improve adaptability to new meme types, outperforming label-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of existing harmful meme detection methods, which rely on extensive labeled data and struggle to adapt to the dynamic, evolving nature of online harmful content.

Method: ALARM uses a Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism to assign pseudo-labels to shallow memes and contrasts them as pairs in a Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm to train an LMM agent for detecting complex memes.

Result: Experiments across three datasets show ALARM’s superior performance and adaptability, even surpassing methods that rely on labeled data.

Conclusion: ALARM provides a scalable, label-free solution for identifying harmful memes, showcasing adaptability to novel and evolving meme forms, and setting a precedent for future scalable detection methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study protein flexibility and dynamics from cryo-EM datasets containing both continuous motions and discrete states, which is a challenging task.

Method: GaussianEM, using a two-encoder-one-decoder framework, maps experimental images into Gaussian components to describe structural variability and dynamics.

Result: GaussianEM effectively models conformational changes and bridges density-based models with corresponding atomic models through tests on simulated and experimental datasets.

Conclusion: The GaussianEM framework is an intuitive and powerful tool for analyzing protein dynamics, aiding in the interpretation of macromolecular cryo-EM data.

Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging. Here we present GaussianEM, a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously models compositional and conformational heterogeneity from experimental cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GaussianEM on both simulated and experimental datasets.

*Rongpei Hong,Jian Lang,Ting Zhong,Yong Wang,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LCMP, a benchmark for assessing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) personalization in long-context dialogue and proposes TAME, a training-free framework, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for MLLM personalization fail to handle long-context dialogues and contextually adapt to evolving personalized concepts, necessitating a solution for more dynamic and context-aware interactions.

Method: The authors propose LCMP for evaluating MLLM personalization and TAME framework, which features double memories for managing concept variations and a Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) framework for improved contextual adaptation.

Result: TAME surpasses existing methods in LCMP evaluations, demonstrating improved interaction quality and contextual behavior in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: TAME and LCMP set a new benchmark for long-context MLLM personalization, advancing the ability of MLLMs to handle dynamic and evolving user interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

*Zhiwen Yang,Jinglin Xu,Yuxin Pen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CausalFSFG, a method improving few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) performance through causal inference, addressing biased data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the biased data distribution and misguidance in feature extraction caused by confounding support samples in FS-FGVC.

Method: Introduced CausalFSFG methodology with structural causal models, interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE), and interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR).

Result: Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrated the method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CausalFSFG effectively alleviates spurious correlations and improves classification accuracy, offering significant advancements in FS-FGVC research.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

*Mutiara Shabrina,Nova Kurnia Putri,Jefri Satria Ferdiansyah,Sabita Khansa Dewi,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses attribute entanglement in text-driven image manipulation, proposing a sparsity-based regularization to improve disentangled editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome unintended semantic alterations in text-guided image edits, ensuring that the changes made to the images remain targeted and disentangled.

Method: A sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation is applied within the Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework.

Result: Experimental findings show more controlled edits, reduced unintended attribute changes, and preserved facial identity during image manipulation.

Conclusion: The sparsity constraint enhances disentangled editing, ensuring precise control over attributes with minimal impact on non-target aspects.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Motivation: To enable interactive autonomous systems to understand dynamic references in natural language, which static appearances or geometry cannot resolve, leveraging multi-frame data to capture temporal interactions and motion is necessary.

Method: The authors propose TrackTeller, a framework combining LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning. It aligns 3D scene representations with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines results using motion and short-term dynamics.

Result: TrackTeller demonstrated a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and reduced False Alarm Frequency by 3.15-3.4 times compared to strong baselines on the NuPrompt benchmark.

Conclusion: TrackTeller is an effective solution for language-based 3D grounding in dynamic driving scenes, showing significant advancements in tracking accuracy and reliability through its integration of multimodal information and temporal understanding.

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretability framework for deepfake detection models using a sparse autoencoder and forensic manifold analysis to uncover how features respond to forensic artifact changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models achieve excellent performance but lack transparency in decision-making processes, necessitating interpretability analysis.

Method: The authors used a sparse autoencoder (SAE) and forensic manifold analysis to examine internal network representations and geometric feature responses to artifact manipulations.

Result: The study reveals that only a small subset of latent features across layers are utilized, and the geometric properties of the feature manifold change systematically with deepfake artifacts.

Conclusion: This work equips researchers to analyze deepfake detector models, enhance transparency, and enable more interpretable and robust future model designs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing cross-domain segmentation methods, which reduce domain-specific information, lowering cross-domain performance and degrading source-domain accuracy.

Method: Introduces Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layers to represent image features as graphs, Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) for semantic relation-guided prediction, and Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to enhance graph node discriminability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain benchmarks and maintains strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

Conclusion: C-Graph effectively improves domain-transferable learning in medical image segmentation while optimizing source-domain performance using innovative graph-based methodologies.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the inconsistency and lack of reliability in outputs from various Vision-Language Models, particularly in STEM educational contexts, where precision and reproducibility are important.

Method: It introduces SlideChain, a framework built on blockchain technology. SlideChain anchors semantic extraction records on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain for ensuring tamper-evident and reproducible outputs. It evaluates this method using data from a medical imaging lecture slides dataset.

Result: The study reveals significant semantic inconsistencies across VLMs and demonstrates that SlideChain effectively detects tampering and ensures reproducibility and scalability in its framework.

Conclusion: SlideChain offers a scalable solution for enhancing the trustworthiness, auditability, and integrity of AI-assisted educational systems, promoting consistency in multimodal educational pipelines.

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the rank collapse phenomenon found in VGGT's global self-attention when processing long sequences, proposing a mathematical explanation and remedy for scalable 3D-vision transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the rank collapse issue in VGGT's global self-attention layer for long input sequences, hindering effective 3D reconstruction.

Method: The authors provide a mathematical perspective, modeling the collapse as a degenerate diffusion process, and derive a mean-field partial differential equation to predict rank changes.

Result: The theory aligns with observed rank profiles and experimental data, explaining why token-merging effectively delays collapse without extra training.

Conclusion: The analysis offers a theoretical lens for enhancing scalable 3D-vision transformers, particularly for addressing dimensional degradation and improving multi-modal generalization.

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Prior-AttUNet is an efficient and accurate tool for automated macular edema segmentation, showing high potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of research and dataset availability for Bengali Handwritten Text Generation (HTG), despite Bengali's global significance.

Method: Development of a self-collected dataset from 500 individuals of varied demographics, pre-processed for consistency, to generate diverse handwritten Bengali text.

Result: The method successfully generates diverse Bengali handwritten outputs from given plain text inputs.

Conclusion: This work advances Bengali handwritten text generation and provides a foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.

Result: FUSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Chameleon and demonstrates high accuracy (91.36% on GenImage, 88.71% across generators) and robust mean Average Precision (94.96%). Stage 2 training further enhances performance.

Conclusion: Integrating spectral and semantic features significantly improves the detection of AI-generated images, offering robustness and reliability across diverse image generators.

Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-MoE to address the limitations in multi-person motion prediction by proposing efficient and flexible spatiotemporal experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with inflexible spatiotemporal representation and high computational costs in motion prediction.

Method: ST-MoE incorporates four expert types, improving spatiotemporal patterns mining while reducing computational cost via bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba.

Result: ST-MoE surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, reduces model parameters by 41.38%, and offers 3.6x faster training.

Conclusion: ST-MoE is effective for capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies flexibly and efficiently in human motion prediction.

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAPTOR, an architecture for video prediction that delivers real-time, high-resolution performance, breaking the typical trade-off between speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time, high-resolution video prediction, especially for applications such as autonomous UAVs in safety-critical environments, where current methods fail due to computational inefficiency.

Method: RAPTOR utilizes a novel Efficient Video Attention (EVA) module, which factorizes spatiotemporal modeling for linear time and memory complexity. The method also employs a 3-stage training curriculum for refining predictions.

Result: RAPTOR achieves over 30 FPS on Jetson AGX Orin with $512^2$ resolution, surpassing existing benchmarks in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across datasets like UAVid and KTH, and improves UAV navigation success by 18%.

Conclusion: RAPTOR demonstrates groundbreaking real-time and high-resolution video prediction, enabling safer and more efficient autonomous UAV operations in dense urban environments.

Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AstraNav-World, an end-to-end model for embodied navigation that jointly predicts future visuals and plans actions. It uses a diffusion-based video generator and vision-language policy for synchronized planning, improving trajectory accuracy and success in diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliable and interpretable embodied navigation in open, real-world environments by enabling precise forecasting of visual states and action consequences.

Method: The approach uses a diffusion-based video generator integrated with a vision-language policy to synchronize visual predictions and action planning. Training is optimized through bidirectional constraints for visual-action coupling.

Result: The model demonstrated improved trajectory accuracy, higher success rates in benchmarks, zero-shot adaptation to unseen scenarios, and transferable spatial understanding without overfitting.

Conclusion: AstraNav-World represents a step toward general-purpose agents capable of robust operation in open-ended, real-world environments by uniting vision and control in a single framework.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Knot Forcing, a novel framework for real-time portrait animation, overcoming challenges like motion discontinuity, error accumulation, and degraded consistency using innovative methods for high-quality and interactive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve real-time portrait animation for applications needing high fidelity, temporal coherence, and ultra-low latency, overcoming the limitations of current causal and non-causal approaches.

Method: The proposed method involves a streaming framework with: (1) chunk-wise generation for global identity preservation and local temporal modeling, (2) a temporal knot module for smooth inter-chunk transitions, and (3) a running ahead mechanism for long-term coherence.

Result: The system achieves high-quality, temporally consistent, interactive portrait animation with real-time performance and strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: Knot Forcing framework successfully addresses challenges in real-time portrait animation, providing a robust and visually consistent solution for infinite animation sequences in interactive applications.

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SyncAnyone, a novel AI framework for high-quality video dubbing, ensuring accurate lip synchronization and high visual fidelity through a two-stage learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing AI video dubbing methods that focus on lip-sync accuracy but compromise dynamic facial motion, background consistency, and spatiotemporal context.

Method: SyncAnyone uses a two-stage learning framework: Stage 1 involves a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting; Stage 2 applies a mask-free tuning pipeline with synthetic training samples to refine accuracy and eliminate artifacts.

Result: Experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation during lip-syncing scenarios.

Conclusion: SyncAnyone successfully enhances video dubbing quality, overcoming previous limitations and delivering improved audio-lip synchronization, visual fidelity, and stability.

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) to train a unified segmentation model for CT and MRI imaging separately and unpaired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of paired, spatially aligned multimodal datasets limits the development of deep learning models in medical imaging. Hence, there is a need for techniques capable of utilizing separate and unpaired cohorts.

Method: The A-QCF-Net uses Quaternion Neural Networks for parameter-efficient, expressive shared feature space construction. The Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion block transfers modality-specific knowledge between CT and MRI streams dynamically.

Result: The model surpassed unimodal nnU-Net baselines, achieving Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI datasets, with explainability analysis ensuring clinically relevant focus.

Conclusion: A-QCF-Net unlocks the potential of unpaired multimodal imaging archives for robust and clinically meaningful pathology segmentation.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking and Swin Transformer windows, to enhance the self-supervised learning of 3D medical imaging. It achieves faster convergence and reduced computational costs compared to traditional ViT-MAE baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of applying self-supervised learning and Vision Transformers to 3D volumetric images, specifically improving spatial relationships and reducing computational inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed method, BertsWin, integrates BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows, ensuring full 3D spatial topology. It introduces a structural priority loss function and single-level local windows to reduce complexity.

Result: BertsWin accelerates semantic convergence by 5.8x and reduces training epochs by 15-fold compared to ViT-MAE baselines, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: BertsWin effectively addresses the challenges in 3D SSL by improving semantic learning, optimizing computational resources, and achieving better performance metrics without additional computational penalties.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

*Jingbo Yang,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid VAE-GAN model which incorporates a memory-efficient Markov chain framework to generate longer video sequences with improved temporal continuity and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation techniques produce short sequences (usually 16 frames), and their quality deteriorates when generating longer sequences. This paper addresses the challenge of generating long meaningful video sequences without compromising quality.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid VAE-GAN video generator with a recall-enabled Markov chain framework. Each state represents a VAE-GAN generator, allowing temporal dependencies and sequential connection of short video sub-sequences.

Result: The proposed method overcomes limitations of classical models by enabling the generation of hundreds/thousands of frames without degrading video quality, ensuring continuity and dynamic temporal scaling.

Conclusion: Markov chain-based recall mechanism and hybrid VAE-GAN structure successfully generate long coherent videos, marking a step forward in advanced video generation technologies.

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing encoder-based methods in segmenting videos by addressing their lack of narrative understanding, reliance on visual-centric biases, and sequential reasoning.

Method: Fine-tuned vision-language model, Scene-VLM, leveraging multimodal inputs (frames, transcriptions, metadata) with sequential dependencies, context window mechanisms, and rationales generation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance, achieving significant improvements (+6 AP, +13.7 F1) on MovieNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM enhances video scene segmentation by multimodal reasoning, offering higher precision and coherent rationale generation, establishing a new benchmark.

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issues of task interference and poor modularity in traditional fine-tuning approaches like LoRA, especially in complex, instruction-driven tasks.

Method: Proposes the InstructMoLE framework using Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR) for global routing of low-rank experts, along with an output-space orthogonality loss to ensure expert diversity.

Result: Experiments show that InstructMoLE outperforms LoRA and other low-rank expert methods on multi-conditional generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: InstructMoLE offers a robust and effective solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, maintaining global semantics and enabling better control over generative tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for super-resolution under noise, specifically showing that moderate guidance enhances reconstruction quality without the need for retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve single-image super-resolution (SISR) accuracy and quality under a known degradation model by exploring the balance between diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength.

Method: Implemented a likelihood-guided diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) approach combining unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning. Used various settings and evaluated fidelity using PSNR, SSIM, and a custom combined selection score.

Result: The best performance was achieved at a guidance scale of 0.95 and noise standard deviation of σ=0.01, attaining a score of 1.45231. Results demonstrated enhanced sharpness and detail recovery in images, outperforming alternative strategies.

Conclusion: Moderate guidance in DPS optimally balances reconstruction quality and stability, removing the need for retraining diffusion models for different operators. Findings stress the importance of combining diffusion priors with gradient strength effectively.

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in cell detection due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and background clutter.

Result: CellMamba significantly outperforms CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based baselines on CoNSeP and CytoDArk0 datasets while reducing model size and inference latency.

Conclusion: CellMamba is validated as an efficient and accurate solution for high-resolution cell detection in pathological images.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to enhance stock movement prediction by leveraging advancements in machine learning and addressing gaps in using raw multi-dimensional financial data instead of simplified models.

Method: The author uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to process multi-dimensional raw financial data, representing it as historical data matrices akin to images.

Conclusion: Applying CNN to raw, multidimensional financial data can significantly aid in accurate stock movement predictions, contributing to cutting-edge financial models.

Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

### [106] [Few Tokens Matter: Entropy Guided Attacks on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21815)
*Mengqi He,Xinyu Tian,Xin Shen,Jinhong Ni,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes vulnerabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) to adversarial attacks using entropy-guided techniques, achieving high success with smaller attack budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand and address the critical safety risks of adversarial attacks on VLMs, particularly the role entropy plays in these vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors identify critical high-entropy tokens that disproportionately influence output and develop Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA) to selectively target these points for efficient and impactful adversarial attacks.

Result: EGA achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) and effectively converts 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones. It also demonstrates transferability to other VLMs with a 17-26% harmful conversion rate.

Conclusion: This research highlights previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in VLM safety mechanisms, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses against entropy-focused adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces XET-V2X, an end-to-end tracking framework for multi-view multimodal fusion in autonomous driving, demonstrating performance improvements under challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios for autonomous driving.

Method: XET-V2X employs a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module, leveraging multi-scale deformable attention to align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities effectively.

Result: Experimental validations on multiple datasets show improved detection and tracking performance, even under communication delays.

Conclusion: XET-V2X ensures robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic settings, advancing V2X collaborative tracking frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion are essential for reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving, especially under occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios. This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention. Multi-view image features are first aggregated to enhance semantic consistency, followed by point cloud fusion guided by the updated spatial queries, enabling effective cross-modal interaction while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the real-world V2X-Seq-SPD dataset and the simulated V2X-Sim-V2V and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations indicate that XET-V2X achieves robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.

### [108] [Scalable Class-Incremental Learning Based on Parametric Neural Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21845)
*Chuangxin Zhang,Guangfeng Lin,Enhui Zhao,Kaiyang Liao,Yajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SCL-PNC, a scalable class-incremental learning approach to address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and structural inefficiencies by enabling demand-driven backbone expansion and implementing dynamic parametric ETF frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-incremental learning faces key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting of old data and overfitting to new data. Structural inefficiencies lead to feature misalignment and class misalignment in evolving class distributions.

Method: SCL-PNC integrates a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier with a demand-driven adapt-layer for minimal-cost backbone expansion. It employs a parallel expansion framework with knowledge distillation to align features and maintain feature consistency.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the SCL-PNC approach for its effectiveness and efficiency in handling incremental class expansion with reduced feature drift and class misalignment.

Conclusion: SCL-PNC efficiently addresses class misalignment and feature drift during class incremental learning by combining neural collapse concepts with expandable backbone mechanisms, adapt-layer, dynamic parametric ETF classifier, and knowledge distillation techniques.

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

*Lupiao Hu,Fasheng Wang,Fangmei Chen,Fuming Sun,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TPS-SCL, a RGB-T salient object detection method tailored for unaligned real-world image pairs, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-T SOD methods falter in real-world scenarios due to the challenges posed by unaligned image pairs with spatial misalignments and cross-modal disparities.

Method: The method employs a Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL) with MobileViT encoder, SCCM for hierarchical feature constraints, TPSAM for spatial alignment, and CMCM for inter-modal dependency exploration.

Result: EXTensive experiments reveal TPS-SCL's superiority, outperforming existing lightweight and mainstream RGB-T SOD methods in performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed TPS-SCL pipeline achieves efficient and robust RGB-T salient object detection on unaligned image pairs, addressing real-world challenges effectively.

Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.

### [110] [Fast Inference of Visual Autoregressive Model with Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21857)
*Haodong Lei,Hongsong Wang,Xin Geng,Liang Wang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree) to improve the speed of autoregressive image models by addressing challenges in speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the inefficiency of autoregressive (AR) image models during inference, as current methods require an excessive number of steps to generate high-quality images.

Method: The ADT-Tree algorithm adapts draft tree depth and width dynamically based on adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates, simplifying regions with less complexity and expanding in more complex areas.

Result: The proposed ADT-Tree method improves speedup by 3.13x on MS-COCO 2017 and 3.05x on PartiPrompts, with compatibility for further acceleration using methods like LANTERN.

Conclusion: ADT-Tree effectively solves the inconsistent acceptance rate issue in AR image models, significantly boosting efficiency while maintaining quality, and is adaptable to existing relaxed sampling techniques.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/Haodong-Lei-Ray/ADT-Tree.

*Masayuki Kawarada,Kosuke Yamada,Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos,Naoto Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIOR is a training-free method to create conditional image embeddings by leveraging a large vision-language model for specific textual conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for conditional image embeddings that focus on specific aspects of an image, which existing models such as CLIP cannot adequately address.

Method: The method prompts a vision-language model to describe the image using a single word based on a given condition and extracts the hidden state as the embedding.

Result: DIOR outperforms both training-free baselines and trained methods in conditional image similarity tasks.

Conclusion: DIOR provides an effective, versatile, and training-free solution for generating conditional image embeddings without requiring additional training or task-specific setups.

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates binary diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and highlights the performance benefit of fusing different CNN backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global challenge of constrained specialist availability and heterogeneous image quality for DR screening by exploring accurate and efficient CNN-based solutions.

Method: The study applies feature-level fusion of pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121) to classify DR across globally sourced fundus images from 11,156 samples pooled from five datasets.

Result: Fusion consistently outperformed single backbones. The Eff+Den fusion achieved the highest accuracy (82.89%) and balanced F1-scores for DR detection with competitive inference speed.

Conclusion: Feature fusion enhances accuracy and generalization for scalable DR screening, balancing computational efficiency and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

### [113] [EasyOmnimatte: Taming Pretrained Inpainting Diffusion Models for End-to-End Video Layered Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21865)
*Yihan Hu,Xuelin Chen,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EasyOmnimatte, a unified end-to-end video omnimatte method that improves efficiency and quality by leveraging a dual-expert finetuning strategy on a video inpainting model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video omnimatte are multi-stage or slow and fail to utilize generative priors effectively, resulting in suboptimal decompositions.

Method: The proposed method finetunes a pretrained diffusion-based video inpainting model to create two complementary experts: Effect Expert for coarse effect-related structures and Quality Expert for refined alpha mattes. This eliminates two full diffusion passes, reducing computational costs.

Result: EasyOmnimatte achieves state-of-the-art performance in video omnimatte tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods in quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The dual-expert design of EasyOmnimatte simplifies video omnimatte processes while improving output quality, making it highly effective for a range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPAR, a novel autoregressive model that dynamically reduces image tokens for efficient image generation, cutting computational costs and improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of fixed-length tokenization schemes in autoregressive image generation, which increases computational and memory demands as image resolution scales.

Method: DPAR uses dynamically aggregated image tokens, guided by next-token prediction entropy, to reduce token count without sacrificing important information. It is minimally modified from standard decoder architectures.

Result: DPAR reduces token counts by 1.81x and 2.06x for 256 and 384 resolution images, saving up to 40% in training FLOPs and improving FID performance by up to 27.1%.

Conclusion: Dynamic tokenization through DPAR enhances efficiency and performance in autoregressive image generation, offering compatibility with multimodal frameworks and scalability for patch sizes.

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reloc-VGGT, a novel visual localization framework using an early-fusion mechanism for robust multi-view spatial integration, ensuring real-time efficiency and accuracy in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional visual localization methods that rely on late-fusion strategies, often leading to insufficient accuracy in complex or unstructured environments.

Method: Utilize the VGGT backbone for multi-view 3D geometry encoding, alongside a pose tokenizer, projection module, and sparse mask attention strategy to efficiently exploit spatial information and reduce computational costs.

Result: Demonstrates robust real-time localization performance with strong accuracy and generalization on extensive public datasets.

Conclusion: Reloc-VGGT effectively integrates spatial relationships for improved visual localization and real-time application, showcasing its robustness across diverse and unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.

Abstract: Digital crown design remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in restorative dentistry. We present \textbf{CrownGen}, a generative framework that automates patient-customized crown design using a denoising diffusion model on a novel tooth-level point cloud representation. The system employs two core components: a boundary prediction module to establish spatial priors and a diffusion-based generative module to synthesize high-fidelity morphology for multiple teeth in a single inference pass. We validated CrownGen through a quantitative benchmark on 496 external scans and a clinical study of 26 restoration cases. Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows. By automating complex prosthetic modeling, CrownGen offers a scalable solution to lower costs, shorten turnaround times, and enhance patient access to high-quality dental care.

*Shen Zheng,Jiaran Cai,Yuansheng Guan,Shenneng Huang,Xingpei Ma,Junjie Cao,Hanfeng Zhao,Qiang Zhang,Shunsi Zhang,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework for generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos, addressing challenges such as short motion limitations and lack of fine-grained detail in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human image animation struggle with creating long-duration videos and lack the ability to generate fine-grained facial and hand detail, limiting their use in high-quality, real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which includes hybrid implicit guidance signals, sharpness guidance factors, a Position Shift Adaptive Module for arbitrary video lengths, a novel data augmentation strategy, and a skeleton alignment model.

Result: Experimental results show that their method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, providing superior high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos.

Conclusion: This framework successfully enhances high-quality, realistic video generation by addressing challenges of duration, detail, and human shape variations, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

### [118] [Patch as Node: Human-Centric Graph Representation Learning for Multimodal Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21916)
*Zeyu Liang,Hailun Xia,Naichuan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PAN, a human-centric graph-based framework for multimodal action recognition, outperforming existing methods by efficiently fusing RGB and skeleton data to create state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenges of heterogeneity in RGB and skeleton modalities and exploit their complementary potential for more effective multimodal human action recognition.

Method: PAN models RGB patches containing human joints as spatiotemporal graphs, enabling efficient fusion and reducing redundancy. Attention-based calibration is introduced to lower the reliance on high-quality skeletal data. Two approaches, PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified, are also proposed for integration.

Result: Both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art performance on three multimodal action recognition datasets under separate and unified modeling settings, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed PAN framework successfully addresses multimodal heterogeneity, enhancing action recognition by fusing skeleton and RGB modalities effectively while surpassing existing benchmarks.

Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPP, an automated system for product poster creation and optimization without human input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing and optimizing product posters manually is time-consuming and requires significant resources.

Method: AutoPP uses a unified design module for cohesive poster generation, an element rendering module for efficient encoding, and an optimizer leveraging online feedback and Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) for click-through rate (CTR) improvement.

Result: AutoPP outperforms existing methods in both offline and online environments, supported by AutoPP1M, a large dataset with one million posters and user feedback.

Conclusion: AutoPP streamlines the product poster creation and optimization process, demonstrating effectiveness and accessibility through public availability of its code and dataset.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

### [120] [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI via Disentangled Anatomy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21924)
*Tao Yang,Xiuying Wang,Hao Liu,Guanzhong Gong,Lian-Ming Wu,Yu-Ping Wang,Lisheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a new unsupervised approach to detect brain MRI lesions by improving pseudo-healthy image reconstruction through disentangled representation and edge-to-image restoration modules, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lesion detection in brain MRI is crucial but challenging due to the variability of lesions and imaging conditions. Existing methods have limitations in generalizability and performance, requiring novel solutions to address these challenges.

Method: The authors introduce two novel modules: a disentangled representation module to separate imaging information from anatomical details, ensuring focus on anatomical structure, and an edge-to-image restoration module to reconstruct high-quality images using high-frequency edge details.

Result: The proposed model was evaluated on nine public datasets comprising 4,443 patients' MRIs and achieved superior performance, with absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC compared to 17 SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves lesion detection in brain MRI by addressing prior limitations, with notable enhancements in generalizability and precision. This establishes a new benchmark for anomaly detection in multi-modality and multi-center MRI imaging.

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

*Yiquan Gao,John See*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing low-light anime scenery images using a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, inspired by Relativistic GAN, and introduces an unpaired dataset to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited focus on low-light enhancement in anime imagery compared to natural images and videos and to bridge the existing domain gap while tackling data scarcity.

Method: This study introduces the DRU framework, which quantifies illumination uncertainty using inspirations from wave-particle duality, enabling dynamic adjustment of objective functions in model training. They also create a curated dataset specifically for anime images with diverse illumination conditions.

Result: The proposed framework, applied with EnlightenGANs, delivers superior perceptual and aesthetic enhancements compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness in leveraging data uncertainty.

Conclusion: The work opens a new pathway for data-centric learning in both visual and potentially language domains, with results indicating the promise of this approach beyond conventional methodologies. The code used is also made available.

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

### [122] [Automated Discovery of Parsimonious Spectral Indices via Normalized Difference Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21948)
*Ali Lotfi,Adam Carter,Thuan Ha,Mohammad Meysami,Kwabena Nketia,Steve Shirtliffe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a structured framework to automatically find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification, achieving high accuracy with simple indices derived from Sentinel-2 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve vegetation classification by creating easy-to-interpret and robust spectral indices with high accuracy while maintaining illumination invariance in remote sensing.

Method: All pairwise normalized differences from spectral bands are generated and expanded using polynomial combinations. Feature selection methods are then applied to identify compact and optimized indices.

Result: A single degree-2 spectral index achieved 96.26% accuracy in detecting vegetation. The addition of more indices slightly improved accuracy to 97.70%. Selected features indicate spectral interactions are more effective than individual band ratios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively produces compact spectral indices that maintain accuracy and illumination invariance, making them deployable and adaptable across different sensors and classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges medical MLLMs face with input noise by introducing training-free methods to enhance multimodal robustness without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust mechanisms in medical MLLMs against real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, which are critical for clinical reliability.

Method: The paper introduces the IMC framework, which leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capacity. It includes Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) for vision noise and a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) for textual data refinement.

Result: The proposed methods achieved state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark with 11 noise types across text and image modalities, demonstrating significant robustness improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed IMC framework can enhance the robustness of medical MLLMs, addressing noise sensitivity and meeting higher clinical safety standards, without the need for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Medical Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising clinical performance. However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

*Qi Lai,JunYan Li,Qiang Cai,Lei Wang,Tao Yan,XiaoKun Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, offering accuracy, speed, and stability with just 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy such as narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, and unclear boundaries, while adhering to surgical hardware constraints.

Method: The proposed LMSF-A framework adopts a co-designed multi-scale attention architecture. It introduces a C2f-Pro module with re-parameterized convolution and multi-scale attention in the backbone, Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE) in the neck to improve detail and consistency, and a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) for reduced parameters and stability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LMSF-A achieves competitive or superior performance across evaluation metrics compared to other methods, while being significantly lighter with only 1.8M parameters and achieving generalization to a new dataset.

Conclusion: LMSF-A effectively addresses the challenges of surgical hardware constraints and challenging visual conditions in spinal endoscopy, providing an efficient and accurate solution for real-time instance segmentation.

Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method to align small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge, reducing reliance on spurious features and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small vision models in critical domains often depend on spurious correlations, making them unreliable in real-world settings. Improving alignment with human knowledge can enhance their robustness and trustworthiness.

Method: The LVLM-VA method uses a bidirectional interface with a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) for translating model behavior into natural language and mapping human specifications to critiques, ensuring better interaction between humans and models.

Result: The method shows significant alignment improvements, reduces reliance on spurious or biased features, and works effectively on synthetic and real-world datasets without needing detailed feedback.

Conclusion: LVLM-VA improves task-level vision model behavior alignment with human knowledge, making models more robust and reducing dependency on flawed features or biases.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

*Jiayu Hu,Beibei Li,Jiangwei Xia,Yanjun Qin,Bing Ji,Zhongshi He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALEAHallu, an adversarial parametric editing framework, to mitigate hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent hallucination in VLMs, caused by over-reliance on linguistic priors and weak integration of visual features, remains a challenge despite current heuristic decoding strategies.

Method: The framework follows an Activate-Locate-Edit Adversarially paradigm. It first builds a dataset of grounded (positive) and hallucinatory (negative) responses, identifies hallucination-prone parameter clusters through differential analysis, and fine-tunes these clusters with adversarially-tuned prefix prompts to reduce visual neglect.

Result: Experimental evaluations on generative and discriminative VLM tasks confirm that ALEAHallu is highly effective in addressing hallucination issues.

Conclusion: ALEAHallu significantly mitigates hallucinations in VLMs by improving their focus on visual evidence, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in addressing this limitation.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/hujiayu1223/ALEAHallu.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iSHIFT revolutionizes GUI interaction via multimodal language models by leveraging a hybrid inference method, balancing efficiency and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving GUI agent tasks' efficiency and precision remains a challenge as existing systems struggle to balance both aspects effectively.

Method: iSHIFT combines implicit slow-fast hybrid inference with Flexible Tokens for attention-guided reasoning and perception control.

Result: Despite its small size (2.5B), iSHIFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: iSHIFT provides a compact, efficient, and accurate solution for complex GUI interactions, advancing the utility of multimodal language models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face challenges in post-disaster navigation due to spatiotemporal complexity. LongFly introduces structured historical data processing, trajectory encoding, and multimodal integration to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV vision-and-language navigation systems struggle with long-horizon navigation in complex environments, leading to issues like inaccurate semantic alignment and path planning.

Method: LongFly employs history-aware spatiotemporal modeling with modules for historical image compression, trajectory encoding, and prompt-guided multimodal integration.

Result: Experimental results show LongFly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with improved success rates (7.89%) and success weighted by path length (6.33%).

Conclusion: LongFly provides a robust solution for refined spatiotemporal context modeling in UAV VLN systems, enhancing navigation accuracy and consistency in diverse environments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

Result: Experiments confirm GenDF's state-of-the-art generalization in cross-domain/manipulation settings and its efficiency with only 0.28M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed GenDF framework effectively enhances the generalization and efficiency of deepfake detection, presenting a significant advancement in countering privacy and online misinformation threats.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of highly realistic fake facial images, posing serious threats to personal privacy and the integrity of online information. Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine the vulnerability of Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) to backdoor threats since classic backdoor attacks like BadNet fail on them.

Method: Proposing a two-stage strategy for backdoor attacks in VSFMs: aligning triggered inputs to target embeddings while preserving clean embeddings in encoders, and training the mask decoder to ensure backdoor manipulations influence output masks across diverse prompts while retaining clean segmentation quality.

Result: BadVSFM achieves strong and controllable backdoor effects, maintains clean segmentation quality, is robust under various settings, and bypasses current defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: Prompt-driven VSFMs exhibit an overlooked vulnerability that can be exploited using BadVSFM, which separates triggered from clean representations and shifts focus to trigger regions, rendering mainstream defenses ineffective.

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

TL;DR: MAI-UI introduces advanced GUI agents with new methodologies, achieving significant improvements in GUI grounding and mobile navigation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve human-computer interaction by addressing limitations in GUI agent functionality and deployment.

Method: Utilizes a self-evolving data pipeline, native device-cloud collaboration, and scalable online RL framework to enhance performance.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple GUI grounding and navigation benchmarks, including significant scalability and system efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: MAI-UI demonstrates innovative technologies that enhance GUI agents and establish superior performance, paving the way for effective deployment in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time interactive digital human avatar model overcoming prior limitations in streaming efficiency and gesture realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: They aim to solve the challenge of real-time avatar streaming, which struggles with efficiency and natural interaction, especially in large-scale motions beyond the head-and-shoulders.

Method: A two-stage autoregressive framework using autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement, along with mechanisms like Reference Sink, RAPR, and Consistency-Aware Discriminator.

Result: The proposed model shows state-of-the-art performance in real-time efficiency, generation quality, and interaction naturalness.

Conclusion: This model advances interactive avatar technology by enabling real-time streaming with coherent gestures and long-term stability, addressing significant gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

TL;DR: This paper proposes \method, a framework for generating interactive worlds using diffusion models, addressing challenges like size, inference delays, and text-controlled generation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in diffusion-generated worlds, including large model sizes, slow inference, and lack of effective text controls, aiming for real-time performance.

Method: \method includes a framework for compressed context and linear attention, acceleration via bidirectional attention distillation, and a text-controlled event generation system.

Result: The study successfully generates realistic, explorable worlds in real-time using single image or text prompts.

Conclusion: \method advances real-time, text-controlled diffusion-based world generation and presents code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

### [134] [Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105)
*Momir Adžemović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel tracking-by-detection method called Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), which improves multi-object tracking by learning associations from data with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of existing multi-object tracking methods: the reliance on handcrafted association heuristics in tracking-by-detection and the high computational complexity in end-to-end approaches.

Method: The authors propose TDLP, which predicts correct track continuations per frame via link prediction using geometric features (bounding boxes) and optionally additional cues like pose or appearance.

Result: TDLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods from both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end paradigms in benchmark experiments, demonstrating superior accuracy and computational benefits.

Conclusion: Link prediction is shown to be a more effective method than metric learning-based association, notably for handling heterogeneous features, offering a modular and efficient multi-object tracking solution.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

*Zhi Ouyang,Dian Zheng,Xiao-Ming Wu,Jian-Jian Jiang,Kun-Yu Lin,Jingke Meng,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProEdit improves image and video editing by reducing reliance on source information in the sampling process, offering better consistency and accuracy in edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of existing inversion-based visual editing methods overly depending on source image information, which affects the quality and accuracy of editing.

Method: ProEdit introduces two strategies: KV-mix for blending attention features of source and target, and Latents-Shift for perturbing the latent domain to minimize source influence during sampling.

Result: ProEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and is compatible with existing inversion and editing methods.

Conclusion: ProEdit enhances editing consistency and accuracy, and its plug-and-play design makes it easily integrable with current methods.

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

### [136] [See Less, See Right: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping For Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22120)
*Shuoshuo Zhang,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), a training paradigm for vision-language models (VLMs) to utilize fine-grained visual evidence and improve generalization across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for VLMs to utilize fine-grained visual evidence and to generalize across domains, overcoming shortcomings like overlooking visual details, inefficiency, and limited domain adaptability.

Method: BiPS trains VLMs through two constraints: a KL-consistency constraint to focus on the question-relevant regions for broad pixel coverage, and a KL-separation constraint to discourage text-only reliance, promoting fine visual reasoning.

Result: BiPS enhances the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B by an average of 8.2% across eight benchmarks while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: BiPS effectively addresses the reliance on fine-grained visual evidence in VLMs, improving performance, domain generalization, and reducing inference-time limitations.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MpGEMM, an optimized library for General Matrix Multiplication on ARM's SME architecture, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear algebra libraries inadequately utilize ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) hardware for large matrix computations.

Method: MpGEMM is designed with optimizations like cache-aware partitioning, on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels leveraging ARM SME features.

Result: MpGEMM outperforms the Apple Accelerate library by 1.23x and surpasses other open-source libraries in real-world workloads.

Conclusion: MpGEMM demonstrates the potential of optimized libraries to fully exploit hardware features, providing superior performance in GEMM tasks on SME architectures.

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a critical kernel in high-performance computing and deep learning. While modern architectures like ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) introduce dedicated hardware for matrix operations, existing linear algebra libraries fail to fully exploit its potential, particularly for large matrices. This paper presents MpGEMM, an open-source library that leverages key architectural features of SME to optimize GEMM across multiple precisions. Through a systematic characterization of SME, we derive optimization guidelines that inform our design. MpGEMM employs cache-aware partitioning, efficient data packing with on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels that utilize multi-vector loads and all available tile registers. Evaluated on an Apple M4 Pro with real-world workloads from DeepSeek and LLaMA, MpGEMM achieves an average speedup of 1.23x over the vendor-optimized Apple Accelerate library and significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinDEP, a task scheduling algorithm enhancing MoE architecture performance, achieving significant GPU throughput improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in the inference process of MoE architecture, such as memory challenges and limited task scheduling capabilities.

Method: Developed FinDEP, which enables fine-grained task scheduling by partitioning tasks, optimizing scheduling with variable granularity, and creating an efficient solver.

Result: FinDEP achieved up to 1.61x throughput improvement over previous methods and 1.24x speedup on large GPU systems during experiments.

Conclusion: FinDEP significantly enhances MoE inference throughput by addressing limitations in memory usage and task scheduling in DEP, improving overall system performance.

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture scales model size with sublinear computational increase but suffers from memory-intensive inference due to KV caches and sparse expert activation. Recent disaggregated expert parallelism (DEP) distributes attention and experts to dedicated GPU groups but lacks support for shared experts and efficient task scheduling, limiting performance.
  We propose FinDEP, a fine-grained task scheduling algorithm for DEP that maximizes task overlap to improve MoE inference throughput. FinDEP introduces three innovations: 1) partitioning computation/communication into smaller tasks for fine-grained pipelining, 2) formulating a scheduling optimization supporting variable granularity and ordering, and 3) developing an efficient solver for this large search space.
  Experiments on four GPU systems with DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen3-MoE show FinDEP improves throughput by up to 1.61x over prior methods, achieving up to 1.24x speedup on a 32-GPU system.

Conclusion: nncase effectively and efficiently unifies compilation workflows across varied computing targets, making it a valuable tool for high-performance LLM deployment.

Abstract: The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by memory architecture heterogeneity, where traditional compilers suffer from fragmented workflows and high adaptation costs. We present nncase, an open-source, end-to-end compilation framework designed to unify optimization across diverse targets. Central to nncase is an e-graph-based term rewriting engine that mitigates the phase ordering problem, enabling global exploration of computation and data movement strategies. The framework integrates three key modules: Auto Vectorize for adapting to heterogeneous computing units, Auto Distribution for searching parallel strategies with cost-aware communication optimization, and Auto Schedule for maximizing on-chip cache locality. Furthermore, a buffer-aware Codegen phase ensures efficient kernel instantiation. Evaluations show that nncase outperforms mainstream frameworks like MLC LLM and Intel IPEX on Qwen3 series models and achieves performance comparable to the hand-optimized llama.cpp on CPUs, demonstrating the viability of automated compilation for high-performance LLM deployment.

*Guopeng Li,Haisheng Tan,Chi Zhang,Hongqiu Ni,Zilong Wang,Xinyue Zhang,Yang Xu,Han Tian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces ESD and HybridDis mechanisms to optimize input embedding sample dispatch for edge workers during DLRM training, reducing transmission costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high transmission costs of embedding tables between edge workers and parameter servers in DLRM training, while managing edge-specific challenges like heterogeneous networks and limited resources.

Method: Developed the ESD mechanism with a HybridDis dispatch decision method combining optimal and heuristic algorithms to minimize embedding transmission costs.

Result: Implemented a prototype of ESD and demonstrated up to 36.76% reduction in embedding transmission cost and 1.74 times speedup in DLRM training via extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed ESD mechanism successfully optimizes transmission costs, enhancing DLRM training efficiency while addressing edge worker challenges.

Abstract: Training deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) on edge workers brings several benefits, particularly in terms of data privacy protection, low latency and personalization. However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational and transmission bottlenecks in processing Ultra-HD video data with vision transformers, enabling real-time analysis under dynamic network conditions.

Method: Hyperion employs a collaboration-aware importance scorer, a dynamic scheduler for adaptive patch transmission, and a weighted ensembler to fuse edge-cloud results for improved latency and accuracy.

Result: Experimental findings show that Hyperion achieves up to 1.61x faster frame processing and a 20.2% accuracy improvement compared to baselines under varying network conditions.

Conclusion: Hyperion successfully tackles latency and accuracy limitations in Ultra-HD videography inference through innovative cloud-device collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in array-camera videography enable real-time capturing of ultra-high-definition (Ultra-HD) videos, providing rich visual information in a large field of view. However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to efficiently deploy large language models on edge devices which are limited by computational and memory capabilities, as well as network bandwidth constraints.

Method: The authors propose LIME, combining interleaved pipeline parallelism, model offloading, an offline allocation scheduler, and an online memory adaptation strategy to optimize edge device operations.

Result: Experiments with LIME on Nvidia Jetson devices achieved 1.7x and 3.7x inference speedups under specific request patterns, outperforming existing baselines while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: LIME successfully facilitates efficient and accurate deployment of large models on edge devices, addressing current computational and memory limitations through novel techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for intelligent reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating substantial impact across a wide range of domains and applications. However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing resource allocation in distributed LLM inference systems, introducing performance models, optimization algorithms, and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs of LLMs running on high-end GPUs and the emergence of distributed systems like PETALS require better resource allocation methods for efficiency.

Method: The paper formulates the block placement and request routing problem as a mixed integer linear programming issue, introduces performance models, and validates solutions experimentally and via simulations.

Result: Experimentation and simulations show that the proposed algorithms effectively reduce inference time vs existing solutions and include a CPU-only simulator for broader accessibility.

Conclusion: Optimized resource allocation in distributed LLM inference can significantly enhance performance, and the developed tools support future research and facilitate deployment on low-end servers.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.

*Deniz Elbek,Kamer Kaya*

TL;DR: BLEST, a framework for optimizing BFS on GPUs using Tensor Cores, achieves remarkable speedups by introducing advanced load balancing, memory efficiency, and computation strategies tailored for graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of Breadth-First Search (BFS) on GPUs where Tensor Cores are underutilized due to the irregular nature of graph computations.

Method: BLEST introduces bitmap-oriented structures, load balancing techniques, tailored graph reorderings, efficient SpMSpV patterns, and kernel fusion to optimize BFS computations.

Result: BLEST achieves significant speedups over existing frameworks, averaging 3.58×, 4.64×, and 4.9× improvements over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH across various real-world graphs.

Conclusion: The engineered BLEST framework successfully utilizes GPU Tensor Cores for BFS by addressing challenges of redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronization, substantially enhancing performance.

Abstract: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph kernel that underpins a wide range of applications. While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.

*Yanmeng Wang,Zhiwen Dai,Shuai Wang,Jian Zhou,Fu Xiao,Tony Q. S. Quek,Tsung-Hui Chang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FedAuto is a Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) framework that addresses unreliable server-client connections and data heterogeneity without requiring prior network condition knowledge or infrastructure changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve FFT performance in real-world settings where unreliable server-client connections and varied client data distributions degrade outcomes.

Method: FedAuto uses adaptive aggregation to handle connection failures and data heterogeneity, without relying on prior knowledge of network conditions or client selection strategies.

Result: FedAuto outperforms state-of-the-art FFT methods across diverse connection failure scenarios, showing superior performance even without complex communication resource optimizations.

Conclusion: FedAuto proves to be effective and adaptable for FFT tasks, offering rigorous convergence guarantees and enhanced performance under various real-world challenges.

Abstract: Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization.

*Zhuoran Zhu,Chunyang Zhu,Hao Lin,Xu Fu,Yiming Zhou,Quanlu Zhang,Zhenhua Li,Feng Qian,Chao Yu,Boxun Li,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FUSCO, a novel communication library designed for more efficient data shuffling in large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, achieving significant performance improvements over existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency in existing communication libraries for MoE models, where shuffling overhead significantly increases runtime during training and inference.

Method: FUSCO optimizes data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, leveraging expert-major data layout analysis, a pipelined communication engine, lightweight planning, and load-balancing mechanisms.

Result: FUSCO outperforms NCCL and DeepEP with speedups up to 3.84x and 2.01x in benchmarks, reduces training latency by 1.17-1.39x and 1.10-1.19x, and lowers inference latency by 1.09-1.25x and 1.06-1.16x.

Conclusion: FUSCO effectively addresses communication bottlenecks in MoE models, providing an efficient and lightweight solution to enhance training and inference performance.

Abstract: Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models rely on \emph{expert parallelism} for efficient training and inference, which splits experts across devices and necessitates distributed data shuffling to route each token to its assigned experts. However, existing communication libraries handle this shuffling poorly; its overhead can account for over half of end-to-end runtime. We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path. Lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms complement the engine by eliminating redundant communication and dispersing traffic. Evaluations on representative benchmarks illustrate that FUSCO achieves up to 3.84$\times$ and 2.01$\times$ speedups over NCCL and DeepEP (the state-of-the-art MoE communication library), respectively. In end-to-end MoE tasks, compared to NCCL and DeepEP, FUSCO reduces the training latency by 1.17-1.39$\times$ and 1.10-1.19$\times$, and lowers the first-token generation latency in inference by 1.09-1.25$\times$ and 1.06-1.16$\times$.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRAXIS, an LLM-powered orchestration tool that improves root cause analysis (RCA) of code- and configuration-related cloud incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unresolved cloud production incidents lead to significant financial losses ($2M+ per hour). Since most incidents stem from code or configuration issues, there is a need to enhance root cause analysis in this domain.

Method: PRAXIS employs a structured traversal guided by large language models (LLMs) over two types of dependency graphs: service dependency graph (SDG) for microservice-level dependencies and program dependence graph (PDG) for code-level dependencies.

Result: PRAXIS achieves up to 3.1x improvement in RCA accuracy and reduces token usage by 3.8x compared to ReAct baselines. It is tested on 30 real-world incidents forming a benchmark.

Conclusion: PRAXIS provides an innovative and efficient method for diagnosing and explaining code- and configuration-related cloud incidents, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.

*Khondoker Mirazul Mumenin,Robert Underwood,Dong Dai,Jinzhen Wang,Sheng Di,Zarija Lukić,Franck Cappello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepCQ, a framework to predict lossy compression quality efficiently using a deep-surrogate model while reducing the computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ever-growing volume of scientific simulation and instrument data necessitates efficient techniques to predict compression quality while avoiding expensive computational costs.

Method: DeepCQ uses a two-stage design separating feature extraction from metrics prediction and incorporates a mixture-of-experts approach to enhance performance on time-evolving data.

Result: DeepCQ achieves prediction errors under 10% across diverse real-world scientific applications, outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: The framework provides scientific users with accurate tools to assess compression quality, enabling smarter data management and analytics with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression techniques have become vital for scientific data management and analytics, given the ever-increasing volume of data generated by modern scientific simulations and instruments. Nevertheless, assessing data quality post-compression remains computationally expensive due to the intensive nature of metric calculations. In this work, we present a general-purpose deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction (DeepCQ), with the following key contributions: 1) We develop a surrogate model for compression quality prediction that is generalizable to different error-bounded lossy compressors, quality metrics, and input datasets; 2) We adopt a novel two-stage design that decouples the computationally expensive feature-extraction stage from the light-weight metrics prediction, enabling efficient training and modular inference; 3) We optimize the model performance on time-evolving data using a mixture-of-experts design. Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our framework empowers scientific users to make informed decisions about data compression based on their preferred data quality, thereby significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in scientific data analysis.

Motivation: To create an effective, unsupervised computational framework that extracts the band structures and Bloch modes of honeycomb lattices and other periodic systems, addressing their unique quantum features.

Method: A physics-informed neural network that learns Bloch functions and eigenvalues simultaneously by enforcing the Schrödinger equation, periodicity, and normalization constraints via a composite loss function.

Result: The model accurately reproduces band structures and Bloch modes, validated against traditional plane-wave methods, and demonstrates adaptability to different potential strengths using transfer learning.

Conclusion: This framework offers a novel, mesh-free approach to quantum eigenproblems, emphasizing the relationship between lattice symmetry, machine learning techniques, and band topology.

Abstract: This thesis presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem associated with particles in two-dimensional periodic potentials, with a focus on honeycomb lattice geometry, due to its distinctive band topology featuring Dirac points and its relevance to materials such as graphene. By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schrödinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology. This work contributes to the growing field of physics-informed machine learning for quantum eigenproblems, providing insights into the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and neural architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLSyn, a reinforcement learning-based framework for generating synthetic data, optimized for small biomedical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing generative models, which require large datasets and complex training processes, making them unsuitable for small-sample biomedical settings.

Method: The research reframes synthetic data generation as a reinforcement learning problem, employing Proximal Policy Optimization and discriminator-derived rewards to enhance training stability and efficiency.

Result: RLSyn performs comparably to diffusion models and better than GANs on larger datasets (MIMIC-IV), while outperforming both GANs and diffusion methods on small datasets (AI-READI).

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning offers a potent and reliable approach for synthetic data generation, especially in settings with limited data availability in biomedical studies.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation (SDG) is a promising approach for enabling data sharing in biomedical studies while preserving patient privacy. Yet, state-of-the-art generative models often require large datasets and complex training procedures, limiting their applicability in small-sample settings. In this work, we reframe SDG as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and introduce RLSyn, a novel framework that models the data generator as a stochastic policy over patient records and optimizes it using Proximal Policy Optimization with discriminator-derived rewards, yielding more stable and data-efficient training. We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning provides a principled and effective alternative for synthetic biomedical data generation, particularly in data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: This survey discusses reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing age of information (AoI) in B5G/6G wireless networks, introducing a taxonomy and addressing open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surveys either focus on classical AoI or general RL in wireless systems, without unifying them under the concept of freshness optimization.

Method: The paper categorizes AoI into three families while proposing a policy-centric taxonomy. It explores RL approaches in areas such as update control, trajectory planning, and scheduling.

Result: A unified framework connecting RL and AoI optimization is introduced, along with challenges like delayed decisions and stochastic variability.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundational guide to RL-driven freshness optimization, paving the way for advancements in next-gen wireless systems.

Abstract: The age of information (AoI) has become a central measure of data freshness in modern wireless systems, yet existing surveys either focus on classical AoI formulations or provide broad discussions of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks without addressing freshness as a unified learning problem. Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

*Shirui Chen,Jiantao Jiao,Lillian J. Ratliff,Banghua Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'dUltra', a reinforcement learning-based framework to improve token generation speed of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), achieving better performance compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MDLMs are limited by their slow parallel decoding speeds, comparable to autoregressive schemes. Existing accelerators are restricted by off-policy training strategies and the quality of generated samples. The gap calls for a new approach that surpasses these limitations.

Method: The authors introduce dUltra, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). An unmasking planner head predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods, and the model is optimized through rewards for accuracy, efficiency, and decoding speed.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks show that dUltra outperforms current heuristic and distillation-based baselines, enhancing the trade-off between accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: dUltra pushes MDLMs closer to achieving 'diffusion supremacy' over autoregressive models by significantly improving decoding efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) offer the potential for parallel token generation, but most open-source MDLMs decode fewer than 5 tokens per model forward pass even with sophisticated sampling strategies. As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.

TL;DR: This paper presents Fed-α-NormEC, a federated learning framework that ensures differential privacy under practical settings like partial client participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of current differential privacy methods in federated learning due to unrealistic assumptions.

Method: The proposed Fed-α-NormEC framework integrates differential privacy guarantees with features like local updates, distinct client-server stepsizes, and partial client participation.

Result: Proven theoretical convergence and differential privacy guarantees, validated via experiments on private deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: Fed-α-NormEC provides practical and theoretically sound differential privacy for federated learning, suited for real-world applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data. Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation. We introduce Fed-$α$-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-$α$-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification. Our theoretical guarantees are corroborated by experiments on private deep learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a general equivariance toolbox to connect neural network symmetries to both first-order (gradient) and second-order (Hessian) learning dynamics. It extends and unifies Noether-type analyses for understanding optimization behavior in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of neural network symmetries are limited to specific problems and primarily address first-order consequences like conservation laws, leaving second-order implications less explored. This paper seeks to provide a broader, generalized framework.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework extending Noether-like analyses to include second-order aspects (Hessian), general equivariance, and both continuous and discrete transformations. They derive constraints that couple first- and second-order learning dynamics.

Result: The framework links transformation structures to predictions about optimization geometry, including loss landscape properties like flatness or sharpness and Hessian-gradient interactions. Previously known results are unified, and new insights are derived.

Conclusion: By generalizing Noether-type theoretical tools, the paper provides deeper insights into the interplay between neural network symmetries and learning dynamics, offering a unified view of optimization characteristics in deep learning models.

Abstract: Many theoretical results in deep learning can be traced to symmetry or equivariance of neural networks under parameter transformations. However, existing analyses are typically problem-specific and focus on first-order consequences such as conservation laws, while the implications for second-order structure remain less understood. We develop a general equivariance toolbox that yields coupled first- and second-order constraints on learning dynamics. The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure. We illustrate the framework through several applications, recovering known results while also deriving new characterizations that connect transformation structure to modern empirical observations about optimization geometry.

Conclusion: RLLaVA provides a competitive and resource-efficient solution for implementing RL algorithms within vision-language models, achieving extensibility and improved results in multi-modal domains.

Abstract: We present an RL-central framework for Language and Vision Assistants (RLLaVA) with its formulation of Markov decision process (MDP). RLLaVA decouples RL algorithmic logic from model architecture and distributed execution, supporting researchers in implementing new RL algorithms with minimal code, and to plug in a broad family of RL methods and vision-language models (VLMs) while remaining agnostic to specific training and inference engines. RLLaVA makes resource-efficient training of 1B--7B models feasible on common GPUs; notably, 4B-scale models can be trained end-to-end with full-parameter updates on a single 24GB GPU. Experiments on multi-modal and agentic tasks demonstrate that RLLaVA has task extensibility, and the models trained with it consistently improve performance over base models, competitive with other specially engineered RL frameworks.

*Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for aligning large language models to user preferences without assuming a specific link function, addressing bias and misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning language models assume a known link between observed preferences and unobserved rewards; however, errors in the assumed link can result in biased outcomes and misaligned policies.

Method: The authors propose $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization and various link-agnostic policy learners, supported by theoretical analysis and finite-sample error bounds. They also provide practical implementations using neural networks and first-order optimization.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate robustness to unknown noise distributions and scales in preference data while optimizing policies directly without explicit reward fitting.

Conclusion: This approach addresses the challenges of bias and misalignment under unknown links, offering robust and effective policy learning solutions applicable to neural networks and batched data settings.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to preference data is commonly implemented by assuming a known link function between the distribution of observed preferences and the unobserved rewards (e.g., a logistic link as in Bradley-Terry). If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards.

TL;DR: This paper compares SARIMA and deep learning models for estimating excess mortality due to substance overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of the pandemic on substance overdose mortality and improve predictive models to better inform public health interventions.

Method: The paper compares SARIMA with three deep learning architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, Transformer) using CDC mortality data from 2015-2019 for training and 2020-2023 for projection, incorporating conformal prediction intervals and extensive trials for validation.

Result: LSTM outperformed SARIMA in point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88%) and uncertainty calibration (68.8% vs. 47.9% coverage), while Seq2Seq and Transformer models underperformed due to overfitting.

Conclusion: Validated deep learning models like LSTM can outperform traditional methods for forecasting under structural disruptions, benefiting public health strategy. Methods like calibration are vital in applying neural models in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Substance overdose mortality in the United States claimed over 80,000 lives in 2023, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing trends through healthcare disruptions and behavioral changes. Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: RR-FBTC extends tensor decomposition capabilities by resolving rank determination issues and improving performance on multidimensional signals.

Abstract: Functional tensor decomposition can analyze multi-dimensional data with real-valued indices, paving the path for applications in machine learning and signal processing. A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: To address the challenge of generating natural language summaries from raw physiological signals collected via wearable devices.

Method: The paper proposes MotionTeller, which integrates a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that converts wearable data into token space compatible with large language models. It utilizes NHANES dataset with supervised cross-entropy loss.

Result: MotionTeller achieves significant improvements with BERTScore-F1 = 0.924 and ROUGE-1 = 0.722, outperforming baseline models by 7% in ROUGE-1.

Conclusion: MotionTeller demonstrates high semantic and lexical performance, providing scalable and interpretable solutions for transforming wearable data into meaningful language summaries, ideal for applications such as behavioral monitoring and personalized healthcare.

Abstract: As wearable sensing becomes increasingly pervasive, a key challenge remains: how can we generate natural language summaries from raw physiological signals such as actigraphy - minute-level movement data collected via accelerometers? In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training. Together, these results position MotionTeller as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, introducing new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

### [162] [Missing Pattern Tree based Decision Grouping and Ensemble for Deep Incomplete Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21510)
*Wenyuan Yang,Jie Xu,Hongqing He,Jiangzhang Gan,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeEIC is a novel framework for incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) that utilizes missing-pattern trees and decision ensembles, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the pair under-utilization issue in IMVC caused by inconsistent missing patterns that limit model performance.

Method: TreeEIC employs missing-pattern trees to partition data based on missing patterns, clusters data within those partitions, uses an ensemble module to combine clustering results, and applies a knowledge distillation module for improved consistency and discrimination.

Result: Experiments showed that TreeEIC outperforms existing methods in IMVC and is robust to highly inconsistent missing patterns.

Conclusion: TreeEIC offers an effective solution to inconsistent missing patterns in IMVC by leveraging tree-based grouping, ensemble aggregation, and knowledge distillation, achieving improved clustering performance and robustness.

Abstract: Real-world multi-view data usually exhibits highly inconsistent missing patterns which challenges the effectiveness of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

*Lei Liu,Hao Zhu,Yue Shen,Zhixuan Chu,Jian Wang,Jinjie Gu,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a perplexity-aware data scaling method to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Continual Pre-training (CPT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to CPT waste data and training resources due to diminishing returns from just increasing the dataset size, thus necessitating a smarter way to select impactful training data.

Method: The method leverages a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law, utilizing the pre-trained model’s perplexity on domain-specific data to estimate the knowledge gap. It prioritizes training samples based on this perplexity to maximize knowledge absorption and minimize noise and redundancy.

Result: The method consistently selected high-utility data subsets and demonstrated superior performance across benchmarks, including medical and general domains.

Conclusion: By adapting data selection based on domain-specific perplexity, the proposed method enhances data efficiency and training outcomes in CPT processes.

Abstract: Continual Pre-training (CPT) serves as a fundamental approach for adapting foundation models to domain-specific applications. Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks.

*Hongqing He,Jie Xu,Wenyuan Yang,Yonghua Zhu,Guoqiu Wen,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive learning-based framework to enhance multi-view clustering, addressing data incompleteness and noise issues through a global-local graph-guided approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data commonly suffer from incompleteness and noise, leading to challenges like rare-paired or mis-paired samples that undermine the effectiveness of contrastive learning in multi-view clustering.

Method: The method integrates global-graph guided contrastive learning to handle rare-paired issues by constructing new sample pairs using a global-view affinity graph. It also introduces local-graph weighted contrastive learning to manage mis-paired issues by adjusting pair-wise weights based on local neighbors.

Result: The proposed framework shows superior performance in both incomplete and noisy multi-view data settings compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework effectively improves clustering outcomes on challenging multi-view datasets without requiring imputation.

Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL) plays an important role in exploring complementary information for multi-view clustering (MVC) and has attracted increasing attention. Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a smart IoT-based monitoring system for detecting and forecasting coolant leaks in AI data centers, achieving high accuracy on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of energy loss caused by coolant leaks in GPU-centric AI data centers, which utilize liquid cooling to manage extreme heat loads.

Method: It combines LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting and Random Forest classifiers for instant detection, utilizing MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards.

Result: The system achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy (at 90% probability within ±30 minutes), and forecasts leaks 2-4 hours in advance while identifying sudden events within 1 minute.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the feasibility of proactively addressing coolant leaks in data centers, potentially saving 1,500 kWh annually, though validation on synthetic data limits current application.

Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in conventional RL algorithms when improving offline pretrained models using online experiences.

Method: GAC reframes policy evaluation as learning a generative model of trajectories and returns, and policy improvement as inference on this model. It uses latent variable models with continuous latent plan vectors and develops strategies for exploitation and exploration.

Result: Experiments on Gym-MuJoCo and Maze2D benchmarks show strong offline performance and significant improvement in offline-to-online contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed GAC framework offers a promising solution to enhance RL performance through generative modeling and versatile inference techniques.

Abstract: Conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, typically focused on estimating or maximizing expected returns, face challenges when refining offline pretrained models with online experiences. This paper introduces Generative Actor Critic (GAC), a novel framework that decouples sequential decision-making by reframing \textit{policy evaluation} as learning a generative model of the joint distribution over trajectories and returns, $p(τ, y)$, and \textit{policy improvement} as performing versatile inference on this learned model. To operationalize GAC, we introduce a specific instantiation based on a latent variable model that features continuous latent plan vectors. We develop novel inference strategies for both \textit{exploitation}, by optimizing latent plans to maximize expected returns, and \textit{exploration}, by sampling latent plans conditioned on dynamically adjusted target returns. Experiments on Gym-MuJoCo and Maze2D benchmarks demonstrate GAC's strong offline performance and significantly enhanced offline-to-online improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, even in absence of step-wise rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome current computational inefficiencies in capturing sequence dependencies and handling ambiguous samples for AVP identification.

Method: A two-stage deep learning framework using adaptive feature fusion with a gating mechanism and contrastive learning with OHEM and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation.

Result: AVP-Fusion demonstrated superior accuracy (0.9531) and MCC (0.9064) on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods, and effectively predicted subclasses even with less data.

Conclusion: AVP-Fusion is a highly accurate and interpretable method for AVP identification, aiding antiviral drug development and subclass predictions.

Abstract: Accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is critical for accelerating novel drug development. However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes. In summary, AVP-Fusion serves as a robust and interpretable tool for high-throughput antiviral drug screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnchorGK, a graph learning framework to enhance spatio-temporal kriging in sensor networks by using anchors for stratification and dual-view graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sparse sensor distribution and heterogeneous auxiliary features in spatio-temporal kriging tasks.

Method: AnchorGK employs anchor-based stratification of data, continuously updating graph-based correlations and integrating feature-relevant and location-relevant learning in its dual-view graph structure.

Result: AnchorGK outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal kriging methods in multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorGK improves inductive spatio-temporal kriging by tackling sparsity and feature incompleteness using structured anchor-based stratification and graph learning.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RefineBridge, a novel refinement module, to improve transformer-based time series forecasting models (TSFMs) for financial data by leveraging a Schrödinger Bridge generative framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in financial time series forecasting, such as non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise, where traditional TSFMs struggle to perform well.

Method: The authors propose RefineBridge, based on the Schrödinger Bridge framework, which refines TSFM predictions by learning stochastic transport maps between generative priors and observed ground truths.

Result: Simulations conducted on multiple financial benchmarks show that RefineBridge consistently enhances TSFM performance across various prediction horizons.

Conclusion: RefineBridge significantly improves transformer-based TSFMs for financial forecasting, making them more robust and effective in handling complex financial data challenges.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR), an efficient framework for imitation learning from videos, outperforming previous methods in sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of enabling autonomous agents to learn skills from videos efficiently, without action/reward signals, or relying on extensive interactions.

Method: The method develops BCV-LR, which uses self-supervised tasks to learn action-related latent features from videos and leverage them for policy behavior cloning. The framework iteratively fine-tunes latent actions and aligns them with real action spaces for effective policy improvement.

Result: BCV-LR achieves expert-level performance on challenging tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency in 24 out of 28 tasks, without additional expert supervision.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates for the first time that videos can enable highly sample-efficient visual policy learning, showcasing an innovative step in autonomous agent learning.

Abstract: Humans can efficiently extract knowledge and learn skills from the videos within only a few trials and errors. However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.
  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates that videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning, without the need to access any other expert supervision.

TL;DR: This study evaluates classical machine learning models' robustness and scalability on imbalanced clinical datasets, finding tree-based ensemble methods (like XGBoost) to be the most practical in emergency care settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and computationally efficient predictive models in emergency care, where clinical data is often imbalanced, motivates this study.

Method: The study evaluated tree-based methods, TabNet, and a new model "TabResNet" on imbalanced datasets from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU, optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter search, and assessed for robustness, scalability, and computational cost.

Result: Tree-based methods (e.g., XGBoost) performed stably across imbalance levels and were computationally efficient, while TabNet consumed more resources and degraded under imbalance. TabResNet was efficient but did not outperform tree-based approaches.

Conclusion: Tree-based ensemble models are the most suitable for emergency and critical care environments due to their robustness, scalability, and practical applicability in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design.

Result: The method achieves longer prediction horizons, reduced computational costs, and physically consistent solutions for complex parameterized evolution equations.

Conclusion: The framework proves to be robust, adaptable, and accurate for parametric PDEs, addressing key weaknesses in traditional neural solvers.

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling a wide range of physical and engineering systems influenced by uncertain or varying parameters. Traditional neural network-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Galerkin Methods, often face challenges in generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to their dependence on full space-time approximations. To address these issues, we propose a novel and scalable framework that significantly enhances the Neural Galerkin Method (NGM) by incorporating the Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm. Our approach leverages space-time decoupling to enable more stable and efficient time integration, while meta-learning-driven adaptation allows rapid generalization to unseen parameter configurations with minimal retraining. Furthermore, randomized sparse updates effectively reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Together, these advancements enable our method to achieve physically consistent, long-horizon predictions for complex parameterized evolution equations with significantly lower computational overhead. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that our methods performs comparatively well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Three model families were investigated: Extra Trees with XGBoost (ET-XGB), Random Forest with LightGBM (RF-LGBM), and Transformer with XGBoost (Transformer-XGB). The target properties included compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and tensile strength (TS), based on an extensive dataset compiled from published experimental studies. Model training involved k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and uncertainty analysis to ensure both robustness and interpretability. Among the tested approaches, the ET-XGB model achieved the highest overall accuracy, with testing R^2 values of 0.994 for CS, 0.944 for FS, and 0.978 for TS and exhibited lowest uncertainty for CS and TS (approximately 13-16% and 30.4%, respectively). The RF-LGBM model provided the most stable and reliable predictions for FS (R^2 0.977), yielding the lowest uncertainty for FS (approximately 5-33%). The Transformer-XGB model demonstrated strong predictive capability (R^2 0.978 for TS and 0.967 for FS) but consistently showed the highest uncertainty, indicating reduced generalization reliability. SHAP analysis further indicated that fiber aspect ratios (AR1 and AR2), silica fume (Sfu), and steel fiber content (SF) were the most influential predictors of strength, whereas water content (W) and the water-binder ratio (w/b) consistently had negative effects. The findings confirm that machine learning models can provide accurate, interpretable, and generalizable predictions of HPC mechanical properties. These models offer valuable tools for optimizing concrete mix design and enhancing structural performance evaluation in engineering applications.

### [176] [Variance-Aware Prior-Based Tree Policies for Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21648)
*Maximilian Weichart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inverse-RPO, a method to extend prior-free UCBs into prior-based UCTs for use in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), showing improved performance over existing techniques without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance of Monte Carlo Tree Search strategies by addressing the limitations in existing prior-based UCTs and systematically extending UCB algorithms with theoretical guarantees.

Method: A novel methodology, Inverse-RPO, was developed to derive prior-based UCTs from prior-free UCB algorithms. This was applied to the variance-aware UCB-V, resulting in two new tree policies incorporating variance estimates.

Result: The new variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform the widely-used PUCT in various benchmarks without adding computational overhead. Extensions to the mctx library for these methods also showcase minimal implementation complexity.

Conclusion: Inverse-RPO provides a systematic and theoretically grounded way to develop advanced prior-based UCTs, enabling better exploration and more efficient learning in reinforcement learning tasks involving MCTS.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has profoundly influenced reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating planning and learning in tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning, exemplified by the AlphaZero family of algorithms. Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

### [177] [Causal-HM: Restoring Physical Generative Logic in Multimodal Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21650)
*Xiao Liu,Junchen Jin,Yanjie Zhao,Zhixuan Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal-HM, a new multimodal framework for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) in robotic welding, addressing causal blindness and data heterogeneity issues. It significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve UAD in smart manufacturing, particularly for robotic welding, by overcoming challenges such as causal blindness and the heterogeneity gap between high- and low-dimensional data.

Method: The method combines a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism for context-driven feature extraction and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture for enforcing unidirectional generative mappings. Together, these approaches utilize the physical dependency between process and result modalities.

Result: The proposed Causal-HM framework achieves an I-AUROC of 90.7% on the new Weld-4M benchmark, setting a state-of-the-art performance across four modalities.

Conclusion: Causal-HM addresses key limitations in existing UAD methods by leveraging causal dependencies and multimodal data in a hierarchical framework, significantly improving anomaly detection accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is critical for quality assurance in smart manufacturing, particularly in complex processes like robotic welding. However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities demonstrate that Causal-HM achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) I-AUROC of 90.7%. Code will be released after the paper is accepted.

### [178] [Rethinking Output Alignment For 1-bit Post-Training Quantization of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21651)
*Dung Anh Hoang,Cuong Pham,Cuong Nguyen,Trung le,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of 1-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a novel method to improve its effectiveness while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and significant performance degradation of current 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods in LLMs and propose a more effective and efficient solution.

Method: The proposed method is a data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs, which explicitly considers activation error accumulation during quantization and maintains optimization efficiency.

Result: Empirical experiments show that the proposed method consistently achieves better performance than existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed data-aware PTQ approach is a more effective strategy for 1-bit quantization in LLMs, enabling better performance with minimal efficiency loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, but their massive sizes hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \(\pm\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.

*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dictionary-Transform GANs (DT-GAN), which provide a stable and interpretable alternative to conventional GANs through a model-based adversarial framework using sparse generative structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GANs encounter significant challenges such as instability, theoretical fragility, and limited interpretability, motivating the need for a more principled approach.

Method: DT-GAN utilizes sparse synthesis dictionaries as the generator and analysis transforms as the discriminator, with constraints on linear operators to ensure theoretical rigor and stability.

Result: DT-GAN achieves well-posed adversarial games with identifiable Nash equilibria and exhibits stability and consistent convergence, outperforming standard GANs in recovering structure and handling heavy-tailed data.

Conclusion: DT-GAN demonstrates that adversarial learning can be theoretically grounded, stable, and interpretable specifically for sparse data distributions, presenting a complementary framework to neural GANs.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used for distribution learning, yet their classical formulations remain theoretically fragile, with ill-posed objectives, unstable training dynamics, and limited interpretability. In this work, we introduce \emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.
  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.
  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades. DT-GAN is not proposed as a universal replacement for neural GANs, but as a principled adversarial alternative for data distributions that admit sparse synthesis structure. The results demonstrate that adversarial learning can be made interpretable, stable, and provably correct when grounded in classical sparse modeling.

*Haochen Lv,Yan Lin,Shengnan Guo,Xiaowei Mao,Hong Nie,Letian Gong,Youfang Lin,Huaiyu Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIPCN, a method designed to enhance traffic flow predictions by addressing uncertainty challenges using spatiotemporal modeling and road impedance theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic traffic flow forecasting methods lack effective solutions for modeling uncertainty causes and capturing spatiotemporal correlations, hindering reliable and accurate predictions.

Method: The authors propose RIPCN, which integrates road impedance theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning. This includes a dynamic impedance evolution network and a principal component network for forecasting eigenvectors and uncertainty patterns.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that RIPCN outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RIPCN advances traffic flow forecasting with improved reliability, interpretability, and accuracy in uncertainty estimation and point prediction.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation services such as navigation and ride-hailing. In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.
  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods.

*Shizhe He,Avanika Narayan,Ishan S. Khare,Scott W. Linderman,Christopher Ré,Dan Biderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an information-theoretic approach to optimize multi-LM architectures by analyzing the mutual information of 'compressor' and 'predictor' systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ad hoc design of compressor-predictor systems in multi-LM architectures and provide guidance on how compression and prediction impact downstream performance.

Method: The authors propose viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel and introduce a mutual information estimator to evaluate compression quality, conducting empirical analyses on five datasets and three model families.

Result: The study reveals that larger compressors are more accurate, token-efficient, and convey more information per token. Compressors outperform predictors in scaling benefits, with larger on-device compressors achieving high accuracy at lower costs.

Conclusion: Scaling compressors rather than predictors is more effective, and utilizing an information-theoretic framework optimizes the design of agentic language model systems for performance and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.

*Hengyi Wu,Zhenyi Wang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an entropy-aware continual learning method to address catastrophic forgetting by dynamically regulating layer-specific entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle catastrophic forgetting in continual learning methods, addressing the issue of balancing stability and plasticity across model layers.

Method: An entropy-aware approach dynamically adjusts layer-specific entropy to mitigate underfitting and overfitting, encouraging generalization through wider local minima.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

Conclusion: Adjusting layer-specific entropy can effectively balance task-specific learning and generalization, thereby enhancing continual learning models.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned ones, but most methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explanation methods for neural networks in predicting tabular data, overcoming challenges like pseudo-correlation and combining causal insights with accurate models.

Method: Proposed the CENNET method, which utilizes structural causal models (SCMs) alongside neural networks, also defining a new explanation power index using entropy.

Result: CENNET was demonstrated to provide effective causal explanations in classification tasks through experiments on synthetic and quasi-real data.

Conclusion: CENNET offers a robust approach to explain neural network predictions by integrating causal models, enhancing interpretability in machine learning.

Abstract: The problem of explaining the results produced by machine learning methods continues to attract attention. Neural network (NN) models, along with gradient boosting machines, are expected to be utilized even in tabular data with high prediction accuracy. This study addresses the related issues of pseudo-correlation, causality, and combinatorial reasons for tabular data in NN predictors. We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for guaranteed error bounds for functions and all their derivatives in neural network approximations.

Method: Constructive approximation of multiplication leading to guarantees for division and exponential functions using GELU-activated feedforward networks.

Result: Obtained error bounds for elementary functions and their derivatives, along with insights into network size, weight magnitudes, and infinite behavior.

Conclusion: The work presents reliable mathematical guarantees for neural network approximations in various domains.

Abstract: We derive an approximation error bound that holds simultaneously for a function and all its derivatives up to any prescribed order. The bounds apply to elementary functions, including multivariate polynomials, the exponential function, and the reciprocal function, and are obtained using feedforward neural networks with the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation. In addition, we report the network size, weight magnitudes, and behavior at infinity. Our analysis begins with a constructive approximation of multiplication, where we prove the simultaneous validity of error bounds over domains of increasing size for a given approximator. Leveraging this result, we obtain approximation guarantees for division and the exponential function, ensuring that all higher-order derivatives of the resulting approximators remain globally bounded.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VAMP-Net, a multi-path machine learning network for predicting drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, achieving over 95% accuracy and enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in drug resistance prediction, including complex genomic epistasis and variable sequencing quality.

Method: VAMP-Net employs a dual-path architecture: Set Attention Transformer for capturing epistatic interactions and a 1D CNN for quality metrics analysis, fused for decision-making.

Result: The method achieved superior accuracy (95%) and AUC (~97%) for resistance predictions, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: The framework offers robust predictive and interpretable solutions for clinical drug resistance genomics, with insights into genetic interactions and sequencing quality reliability.

Abstract: Genomic prediction of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains challenging due to complex epistatic interactions and highly variable sequencing data quality. We present a novel Interpretable Variant-Aware Multi-Path Network (VAMP-Net) that addresses both challenges through complementary machine learning pathways. Path-1 employs a Set Attention Transformer processing permutation-invariant variant sets to capture epistatic interactions between genomic loci. Path-2 utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network that analyzes Variant Call Format quality metrics to learn adaptive confidence scores. A fusion module combines both pathways for final resistance classification. We conduct comparative evaluations of unmasked versus padding-masked Set Attention Blocks, and demonstrate that our multi-path architecture achieves superior performance over baseline CNN and MLP models, with accuracy exceeding 95% and AUC around 97% for Rifampicin (RIF) and Rifabutin (RFB) resistance prediction. The framework provides dual-layer interpretability: Attention Weight Analysis reveals Epistatic networks, and Integrated Gradients (IG) was applied for critical resistance loci (notably rpoB), while gradient-based feature importance from the CNN pathway uncovers drug-specific dependencies on data quality metrics. This architecture advances clinical genomics by delivering state-of-the-art predictive performance alongside auditable interpretability at two distinct levels, genetic causality of mutation sets and technical confidence of sequencing evidence, establishing a new paradigm for robust, clinically-actionable resistance prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to data scarcity and confidentiality issues in finance, developing and testing robust models is challenging.

Method: A unified multi-criteria evaluation framework was applied to assess synthetic data fidelity, temporal structure, and practical utility across ARIMA-GARCH, VAEs, and TimeGAN paradigms.

Result: ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and volatility, VAEs underestimate extreme events, and TimeGAN performs best in realism and coherence with the lowest MMD.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical model selection guidelines and sets a standardized benchmarking protocol for synthetic financial data research.

Abstract: Data scarcity and confidentiality in finance often impede model development and robust testing. This paper presents a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework for synthetic financial data and applies it to three representative generative paradigms: the statistical ARIMA-GARCH baseline, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN). Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds). Finally, we articulate practical guidelines for selecting generative models according to application needs and computational constraints. Our unified evaluation protocol and reproducible codebase aim to standardize benchmarking in synthetic financial data research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical foundation for the performance scaling of transformer-based language models under increasing computational resources. The analysis reveals a phase transition in risk decay and establishes scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in the theoretical understanding of the performance scaling laws of Large Language Models, which has mostly been validated empirically but lacked a formal theoretical explanation.

Method: The authors formalized the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system and approximated this as kernel-based behaviors. They performed a rigorous analysis of SGD training on multi-layer transformers with real-world sequence-to-sequence data distributions.

Result: They characterized the convergence of generalization error to irreducible risk, showing exponential decay in risk during early resource allocation, followed by a power-law decay in a subsequent statistical phase.

Conclusion: The research provides a unified framework explaining how computational resources, model size, training time, and dataset size impact generalization error. It establishes theoretical bounds on excess risk and sheds light on the scaling laws underpinning LLM optimization.

Abstract: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.
  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

TL;DR: The authors analyze how different KL divergence estimation methods impact RL training for LLMs and provide empirical evidence on biased versus unbiased configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reasoning performance of LLMs through reinforcement learning, addressing gradient bias issues in KL divergence estimation.

Method: Analyze KL estimation practices, study their gradient effects, and empirically evaluate different configurations using RL fine-tuning of various large language models.

Result: Biased estimators cause instabilities, while unbiased estimators improve in-domain and out-of-domain task performance. KL regularization stabilizes off-policy RL training.

Conclusion: Adopting unbiased estimators enhances stability and performance during RL fine-tuning of LLMs both on- and off-policy.

Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of automating the creation of insightful and coherent data-visualization reports from raw datasets.

Method: A multi-agent system where the 'Data Analyzer' manages profiling, visualization, and insight generation, and the 'Presenter' creates a structured, narrative report.

Result: A2P-Vis reliably converts raw data into professional-grade visual and textual data reports, reducing the need for manual intervention.

Conclusion: The integrated system enhances automated data analysis, making it more practical and valuable for industry practitioners.

Abstract: Automating end-to-end data science pipeline with AI agents still stalls on two gaps: generating insightful, diverse visual evidence and assembling it into a coherent, professional report. We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

*Yiming Qian,Thorsten Neumann,Xueyining Huang,David Hardoon,Fei Gao,Yong Liu,Siow Mong Rick Goh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for distilling financial fraud detection datasets while preserving explainability, privacy, and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a privacy-preserving and interpretable dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection in multi-institution scenarios.

Method: Converted a trained random forest into axis-aligned rule regions, generating synthetic transactions while preserving feature interactions and utilizing rule statistics for interpretability.

Result: Achieved 85%-93% data reduction, competitive model performance, improved cross-cluster metrics, low memorization risk, and enhanced calibration through sensitivity testing.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates deployable fraud analytics with interpretable rules, case-specific rationales, and strong privacy features, suitable for regulatory purposes.

Abstract: We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.
  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).
  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.

*Carolina Aparício,Qi Shi,Bo Wen,Tesfaye Yadete,Qiwei Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMCTOP, a framework for integrating diverse biomedical data to predict clinical trial outcomes using advanced multimodal techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the prediction and reliability of clinical trial outcomes by integrating diverse, high-dimensional biomedical data and addressing challenges in multimodal fusion.

Method: MMCTOP employs modality-aware representation learning, schema-guided textualization, and domain-specific encoders. It uses a transformer backbone with a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) for efficient data fusion and scalability.

Result: Results show MMCTOP outperforms unimodal and traditional multimodal baselines in precision, F1, and AUC metrics. Ablation studies highlight the importance of its design components.

Conclusion: MMCTOP ensures calibrated and reliable predictions, advancing multimodal biomedical informatics with features that enhance stability, auditability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of multimodal data fusion in high-dimensional biomedical informatics, we propose MMCTOP, a MultiModal Clinical-Trial Outcome Prediction framework that integrates heterogeneous biomedical signals spanning (i) molecular structure representations, (ii) protocol metadata and long-form eligibility narratives, and (iii) disease ontologies. MMCTOP couples schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, in which domain-specific encoders generate aligned embeddings that are fused by a transformer backbone augmented with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support. Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards aimed at auditability and reproducibility in biomedical informatics.

### [192] [GQ-VAE: A gated quantized VAE for learning variable length tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21913)
*Theo Datta,Kayla Huang,Sham Kakade,David Brandfonbrener*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gated Quantized Variational Autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a neural tokenizer that is a scalable, drop-in replacement for traditional deterministic tokenizers like BPE, improving compression and downstream language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers such as BPE rely on deterministic frequency-based approaches and do not fully leverage neural network design. Current learned neural tokenizers are hard to scale due to increased underlying model complexity and architecture changes.

Method: This paper proposes GQ-VAE, a standalone, pre-trainable neural architecture that encodes variable-length discrete tokens without altering language model architecture or complexity.

Result: GQ-VAE surpasses standard VQ-VAE tokenizer in compression and language modeling performance, matching or surpassing BPE in comparable vocabulary conditions while enhancing language model learning.

Conclusion: GQ-VAE offers a scalable, effective replacement for BPE tokenizers, opening new possibilities for further improvements in learned tokenization methods.

Abstract: While most frontier models still use deterministic frequency-based tokenization algorithms such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), there has been significant recent work to design learned neural tokenizers. However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE. Interestingly, if we use BPE with a smaller vocabulary, such that the compression is equivalent between GQ-VAE and BPE, we find that GQ-VAE improves downstream language model learning. We conclude with a discussion of several exciting avenues for future work. Code can be found at https://github.com/Theo-Datta-115/gq-vae.

### [193] [Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21915)
*Yafeng Tang,Xiaoou Ding,Jianzhuo Du,Zishuo Yan,Zhuang Ma,Zheng Liang,Zekai Qian,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DATE, a framework for tabular data generation, highlighting diversity and quality trade-offs, and outperforming previous methods in generating high-quality machine learning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models struggle to handle heterogeneous real-world data with diverse distributions, creating a demand for more effective data generation methods.

Method: DATE partitions heterogeneous data into diverse subsets and utilizes LLMs and decision tree reasoning for high-quality data generation. A Multi-Arm Bandit algorithm is introduced to balance diversity and quality in data selection.

Result: DATE achieves a 23.75% error rate reduction on average with only 100 generated data points, outperforming GAN-based and LLM-based methods in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: DATE enables improved machine learning accuracy by generating diverse and high-quality synthetic data, addressing limitations of prior methods in heterogeneous data environments.

Abstract: Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

*Kongchang Zhou,Tingyu Zhang,Wei Chen,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces hybrid CMAB-T to address the limitations of online and offline multi-armed bandit approaches by combining them in a principled manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online algorithms for CMAB-T face high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are limited by dataset quality and exploration capacity.

Method: The hybrid CUCB algorithm combines offline data with online interactions, leveraging offline data for guided exploration while correcting bias with controlled online actions.

Result: The algorithm theoretically achieves lower regret compared to purely online approaches with quality offline data and mitigates biases of offline methods when data is insufficient.

Conclusion: The hybrid CUCB framework successfully integrates offline and online paradigms, offering consistent theoretical and empirical improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: The problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T) has been extensively studied. Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel deep learning framework, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, which predicts antigen-antibody binding affinity from sequences without relying on 3D structures, showcasing superior performance to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity and computational cost of 3D structural data, the paper aims to develop a sequence-based model for predicting antigen-antibody binding affinity.

Method: The authors introduced a sequence-based Dual Deep Learning model (DuaDeep-SeqAffinity) using pre-trained ESM-2 embeddings combining CNNs for local patterns and Transformers for global context. A fusion module integrates features for regression-based output.

Result: DuaDeep-SeqAffinity outperforms existing methods with a Pearson correlation of 0.688, R^2 of 0.460, RMSE of 0.737, and an AUC of 0.890 for binding affinity predictions.

Conclusion: High-quality sequence embeddings can capture binding patterns effectively, eliminating the need for 3D structures and enabling efficient high-throughput therapeutic screening.

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between antigens and antibodies is fundamental to drug discovery and vaccine development. Traditional computational approaches often rely on experimentally determined 3D structures, which are scarce and computationally expensive to obtain. This paper introduces DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, a novel sequence-only deep learning framework that predicts affinity scores solely from their amino acid sequences using a dual-stream hybrid architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling. By eliminating the reliance on 3D structures, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity provides a highly scalable and efficient solution for high-throughput screening of vast sequence libraries, significantly accelerating the therapeutic discovery pipeline.

*Chengyu Tian,Wenbin Pei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework to improve robustness prediction in hypergraphs, achieving higher expressive power and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is need for efficient and accurate robustness assessments in systems modeled as hypergraphs, overcoming computational challenges and limitations in previously used Neural Network-based methods.

Method: The paper proposes a Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework inspired by the Graph Isomorphism Network. It leverages the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test for theoretical maximum expressive power.

Result: This approach outperforms existing graph-based models and conventional HGNNs in robust hypergraph representation tasks while ensuring training and prediction efficiency.

Conclusion: The Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework provides an effective solution for tackling robustness prediction, combining theoretical rigor with practical utility.

Abstract: Robustness in complex systems is of significant engineering and economic importance. However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.

*Wesley S. Leite,Rodrigo C. de Lamare,Yuriy Zakharov,Wei Liu,Martin Haardt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a variable window size spatial smoothing method to improve DOA estimation for sparse linear arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the performance of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation when using sparse linear arrays.

Method: Introducing variable window size smoothing in Coarray MUSIC and Coarray root-MUSIC to increase signal and noise subspace separation by replacing perturbed rank-one products with additional terms.

Result: Improved performance and reduced computational complexity in DOA estimation through simulations compared to fixed-window methods.

Conclusion: Variable window size framework offers a clear advantage in enhancing sparse array DOA estimation while reducing complexity.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a variable window size (VWS) spatial smoothing framework that enhances coarray-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sparse linear arrays. By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of fragmented Continual Learning (CL) research by introducing LibContinual, a unified library to ensure fair, reproducible evaluations of existing methods while highlighting shortcomings under real-world constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the fragmentation in CL research, characterized by inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varied evaluation methodologies, which hamper fair comparison and reproducible studies.

Method: The authors developed LibContinual, a standardized library with a modular architecture integrating 19 algorithms across five methodological categories, along with novel evaluation protocols to test real-world constraints in CL.

Result: LibContinual revealed implicit assumptions in traditional evaluation protocols, showing significant performance drops among mainstream CL methods when real-world constraints were applied, signifying these methods' lack of robustness.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for resource-conscious and semantically robust continual learning strategies, offering LibContinual as a toolkit for advancing research in realistic CL settings.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in Continual Learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks degrades the performance on previous ones. While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

*Nagham Osman,Vittorio Lembo,Giovanni Bottegoni,Laura Toni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the use of generative models for hit-like molecule generation in drug discovery, evaluates their capabilities across benchmarks, and demonstrates promising results with synthesized and validated compounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hit identification in drug discovery is resource-intensive and traditional methods are costly. The authors aim to determine if generative models can specifically aid the hit identification stage.

Method: The study benchmarked two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models, using a multi-stage filtering evaluation framework that incorporates physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria.

Result: The generative models produced valid, diverse, and biologically active compounds, with successful synthesis and in vitro validation of selected hits. Limitations in evaluation and data are also reported.

Conclusion: Generative models show potential for replacing parts of the hit identification workflows in drug discovery, but further work is needed to address limitations in metrics and training data.

Abstract: Hit identification is a critical yet resource-intensive step in the drug discovery pipeline, traditionally relying on high-throughput screening of large compound libraries. Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro. We also identify key limitations in current evaluation metrics and available training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of smoothness-based stability analyses for ReLU networks, presenting a counterexample and proposing conditions for stability in nonsmooth settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of modern learning systems relying on stability analyses derived under smoothness assumptions that do not apply to ReLU-type nonlinearities.

Method: The authors isolate a minimal obstruction, provide a concrete counterexample showing the limitations of classical stability bounds for ReLU networks, and introduce a generalized derivative condition to restore stability statements.

Result: Classical stability bounds fail globally for ReLU networks; however, the authors identify a minimal condition that enables meaningful stability analysis in these systems.

Conclusion: Smoothness-based approaches can be misleading for ReLU networks, and the study motivates a transition toward nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.

Abstract: Stability analyses of modern learning systems are frequently derived under smoothness assumptions that are violated by ReLU-type nonlinearities. In this note, we isolate a minimal obstruction by showing that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy such as gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control can hold globally for ReLU networks, even in simple settings where training trajectories appear empirically stable. We give a concrete counterexample demonstrating the failure of classical stability bounds and identify a minimal generalized derivative condition under which stability statements can be meaningfully restored. The result clarifies why smooth approximations of ReLU can be misleading and motivates nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Selective Adversarial Training to reduce computational inefficiency in Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial training by focusing on a subset of critical samples, effectively halving computation costs while maintaining or improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency in adversarial training using PGD, where all samples undergo identical iterative optimization despite varied contributions to robustness.

Method: Introduce two sample selection criteria—(1) margin-based sampling (selecting samples near the decision boundary) and (2) gradient-matching sampling (selecting samples with gradients aligning with batch optimization)—for targeted adversarial example generation in minibatches.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show comparable or superior robustness to traditional PGD training, while reducing computational cost by up to 50%.

Conclusion: Selective sampling can replace full PGD adversarial training, achieving scalable robustness with significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a strong and widely used first-order adversarial attack, yet its computational cost scales poorly, as all training samples undergo identical iterative inner-loop optimization despite contributing unequally to robustness. Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each minibatch. Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed methods achieve robustness comparable to, or even exceeding, full PGD adversarial training, while reducing adversarial computation by up to $50\%$, demonstrating that informed sample selection is sufficient for scalable adversarial robustness.

*Zhaozhao Ma,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel multimodal regression framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which improves interpretability and predictive accuracy while allowing efficient modality selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal regression struggles with interpretability and quantifying modality contributions due to the lack of tools for disentangling input sources.

Method: The framework uses PID to decompose input into unique, redundant, and synergistic components, enforcing Gaussianity in latent representations for analytical PID computation and introducing a conditional independence regularizer to isolate unique modality information.

Result: The proposed method achieves better predictive accuracy, interpretability, and modality selection on six datasets, including a case study in brain age prediction.

Conclusion: The framework advances multimodal regression by enhancing both interpretability and prediction, supporting practical applications with informed modality usage.

Abstract: Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference. Implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg.

*Yanchen Chen,Daniel Andrés Díaz-Pachón*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces conserved active information, a measure accounting for net information gain/loss across a search space, distinguishing global disorder and strong knowledge effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address limitations of active information by creating a refined measure that respects conservation principles and can detect regimes unidentifiable by existing metrics like KL divergence.

Method: The authors propose conserved active information $I^\oplus$, demonstrate scenarios with theoretical and practical examples (e.g., Bernoulli, Markov chains), and formalize their findings under uniform baseline settings.

Result: The new metric distinguishes between increasing knowledge causing global disorder and strong knowledge promoting order, with validation through mathematical proofs and case studies.

Conclusion: Conserved active information resolves critiques of active information and offers a broader applicability in fields like search, optimization, and cosmology.

Abstract: We introduce conserved active information $I^\oplus$, a symmetric extension of active information that quantifies net information gain/loss across the entire search space, respecting No-Free-Lunch conservation. Through Bernoulli and uniform-baseline examples, we show $I^\oplus$ reveals regimes hidden from KL divergence, such as when strong knowledge reduces global disorder. Such regimes are proven formally under uniform baseline, distinguishing disorder (increasing mild knowledge from order-imposing strong knowledge. We further illustrate these regimes with examples from Markov chains and cosmological fine-tuning. This resolves a longstanding critique of active information while enabling applications in search, optimization, and beyond.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal Posterior Inference (TPI) which unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic, and develops methods to compute bounds on temporal properties in probabilistic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in current probabilistic programming inference techniques, which fail to capture temporal evolution in probabilistic behaviors and focus only on program states at fixed time points.

Method: The authors introduce TPI, a framework that combines probabilistic programming with temporal logic to infer posterior distributions over program traces satisfying omega-regular specifications. They decompose Rabin acceptance into persistence and recurrence components and utilize stochastic barrier certificates for rigorous bounds.

Result: The prototype tool, TPInfer, developed by the authors demonstrates effective and efficient inference on benchmarks with rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.

Conclusion: TPI provides a novel approach to extending probabilistic programming by incorporating temporal logic, offering robust tools and methodologies for analyzing temporal behaviors in probabilistic systems.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming provides a high-level framework for specifying statistical models as executable programs with built-in randomness and conditioning. Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.

Method: A dynamic prediction model, improved IFDS algorithm, and MPC framework are employed for path planning, augmented by a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment mechanism to enhance spatial resolution.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 98% obstacle avoidance success rate, improves path smoothness, and increases effective observation data volume by 27%.

Conclusion: The paper offers an engineering solution for UAVs to perform accurate water quality monitoring in complex and dynamic lighting conditions while ensuring safety and data quality.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.

*Rahul Moorthy Mahesh,Oguzhan Goktug Poyrazoglu,Yukang Cao,Volkan Isler*

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaceForecaster, a framework integrating co-pilot instructions to safely and efficiently guide robot motion planning in cluttered environments, improving navigation performance by 36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of achieving a balance between safety and speed in motion planning under uncertain conditions, such as occlusions or limited sensor range.

Method: The authors propose PaceForecaster, which uses local sensor data and co-pilot instructions to predict a forecasted map (Level-2) and condition an instruction-based subgoal within this map, guiding a Log-MPPI controller for robust navigation.

Result: PaceForecaster significantly improves navigation performance by 36% in polygonal environments compared to a baseline approach relying solely on local maps.

Conclusion: Incorporating co-pilot instructions and leveraging forecasted maps improves decisiveness and safety in motion planning, proving effective for enhancing robot navigation in uncertain and cluttered settings.

Abstract: In cluttered environments, motion planners often face a trade-off between safety and speed due to uncertainty caused by occlusions and limited sensor range. In this work, we investigate whether co-pilot instructions can help robots plan more decisively while remaining safe. We introduce PaceForecaster, as an approach that incorporates such co-pilot instructions into local planners. PaceForecaster takes the robot's local sensor footprint (Level-1) and the provided co-pilot instructions as input and predicts (i) a forecasted map with all regions visible from Level-1 (Level-2) and (ii) an instruction-conditioned subgoal within Level-2. The subgoal provides the planner with explicit guidance to exploit the forecasted environment in a goal-directed manner. We integrate PaceForecaster with a Log-MPPI controller and demonstrate that using language-conditioned forecasts and goals improves navigation performance by 36% over a local-map-only baseline while in polygonal environments.

*Hang Zhou,Yuhui Zhai,Shiyu Shen,Yanfeng Ouyang,Xiaowei Shi,Xiaopeng*

TL;DR: This study proposes a framework to understand Urban Air Mobility (UAM) traffic flow using real-world experiments, simulations, and theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of macroscopic traffic flow characteristics of UAM systems, especially under realistic operating conditions.

Method: A framework is developed by deriving a Fundamental Diagram (FD) of UAM traffic through theoretical design, simulations, and real-world physical experiments using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones on a reduced-scale testbed.

Result: The study finds that classical Fundamental Diagram structures used for ground transportation are valid for UAM systems. However, physical experiments show deviations from simulation results, emphasizing the need for experimental validation.

Conclusion: The research provides key insights into UAM traffic dynamics and scalability for future real-world systems. It also highlights the necessity for combining theoretical, simulation, and experimental methods.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that promises to reduce travel time and alleviate congestion in urban transportation systems. As drone density increases, UAM operations are expected to experience congestion similar to that in ground traffic. However, the fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow, particularly under real-world operating conditions, remain poorly understood. This study proposes a general framework for constructing the fundamental diagram (FD) of UAM traffic by integrating theoretical analysis with physical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to derive a UAM FD using real-world physical test data. On the theoretical side, we design two drone control laws for collision avoidance and develop simulation-based traffic generation methods to produce diverse UAM traffic scenarios. Based on Edie's definition, traffic flow theory is then applied to construct the FD and characterize the macroscopic properties of UAM traffic. To account for real-world disturbances and modeling uncertainties, we further conduct physical experiments on a reduced-scale testbed using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones. Both simulation and physical test trajectory data are collected and organized into the UAMTra2Flow dataset, which is analyzed using the proposed framework. Preliminary results indicate that classical FD structures for ground transportation are also applicable to UAM systems. Notably, FD curves obtained from physical experiments exhibit deviations from simulation-based results, highlighting the importance of experimental validation. Finally, results from the reduced-scale testbed are scaled to realistic operating conditions to provide practical insights for future UAM traffic systems. The dataset and code for this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/CATS-Lab/UAM-FD.

*Yusuf Ali,Gryphon Patlin,Karthik Kothuri,Muhammad Zubair Irshad,Wuwei Liang,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents EVE, a framework enhancing pretrained visuomotor policies by combining them with zero-shot VLM-based verifiers at inference, improving manipulation task success rates without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative visuomotor policies struggle under distribution shifts and lack robust recovery without costly fine-tuning. Inspired by compute scaling in language models, the authors aim to explore additional inference-time compute using verifiers to improve visuomotor policy performance.

Method: The proposed EVE framework includes a generator-verifier system where frozen generative policies interact with multiple zero-shot VLM verifiers. Each verifier refines candidate actions, which are then fused into a final prediction by an action incorporator.

Result: EVE enhances task success rates across diverse manipulation tasks without requiring further training, demonstrating effectiveness through comprehensive ablations and design analysis.

Conclusion: EVE successfully improves pretrained visuomotor policy performance using a modular generator-verifier interaction framework, offering practical insights for designing scalable embodied control systems.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies based on generative architectures such as diffusion and flow-based matching have shown strong performance but degrade under distribution shifts, demonstrating limited recovery capabilities without costly finetuning. In the language modeling domain, test-time compute scaling has revolutionized reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs by leveraging additional inference-time compute for candidate solution refinement. These methods typically leverage foundation models as verification modules in a zero-shot manner to synthesize improved candidate solutions. In this work, we hypothesize that generative policies can similarly benefit from additional inference-time compute that employs zero-shot VLM-based verifiers. A systematic analysis of improving policy performance through the generation-verification framework remains relatively underexplored in the current literature. To this end, we introduce EVE - a modular, generator-verifier interaction framework - that boosts the performance of pretrained generative policies at test time, with no additional training. EVE wraps a frozen base policy with multiple zero-shot, VLM-based verifier agents. Each verifier proposes action refinements to the base policy candidate actions, while an action incorporator fuses the aggregated verifier output into the base policy action prediction to produce the final executed action. We study design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across a system of verifiers with distinct capabilities. Across a diverse suite of manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without any additional policy training. Through extensive ablations, we isolate the contribution of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies, offering practical guidelines to build scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in available data, benchmarks, and evaluation methods in autonomous planetary rover navigation research.

Method: Development of MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench datasets using high-resolution terrain images, and the evaluation of classical and learned path planning algorithms within a unified framework.

Result: Classical algorithms performed well with up to 100% success rates on challenging terrains, while learning-based models showed promise but struggled in planetary domains.

Conclusion: The datasets and insights provide foundational tools for advancing fundamental research in planetary path planning, with the release aimed at encouraging community-wide improvement.

Abstract: Planetary rover exploration is attracting renewed interest with several upcoming space missions to the Moon and Mars. However, a substantial amount of data from prior missions remain underutilized for path planning and autonomous navigation research. As a result, there is a lack of space mission-based planetary datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we take a step towards coordinating these three research directions in the context of planetary rover path planning. We propose the first two large planar benchmark datasets, MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench, derived from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. In addition, we set up classical and learned path planning algorithms, in a unified framework, and evaluate them on our proposed datasets and on a popular planning benchmark. Through comprehensive experiments, we report new insights on the performance of representative path planning algorithms on planetary terrains, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our results show that classical algorithms can achieve up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains such as Moon's north and south poles. This suggests, for instance, why these algorithms are used in practice by NASA. Conversely, learning-based models, although showing promising results in less complex environments, still struggle to generalize to planetary domains. To serve as a starting point for fundamental path planning research, our code and datasets will be released at: https://github.com/mchancan/PlanetaryPathBench.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a framework that ensures safety and task completion in uncertain, dynamic environments for robotic systems.

Method: The method involves synthesizing real-time spatiotemporal tubes as a dynamically changing ball in the state space, using probabilistic guarantees and a closed-form control law.

Result: A model-free, optimization-free controller was developed, ensuring task completion and safety, and validated on mobile robots, UAVs, and manipulators.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient, scalable, and successfully guarantees probabilistic safety and task convergence in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In this work, we extend the Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework to address Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (PrT-RAS) tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. We develop a real-time tube synthesis procedure that explicitly accounts for time-varying uncertain obstacles and provides formal probabilistic safety guarantees. The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, a UAV, and a 7-DOF manipulator navigating in cluttered and uncertain environments.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve variable stiffness mechanisms for robotics, leveraging electrostatic effects for smaller footprints and better controllability.

Method: The method incorporates a helical structure enhancing stiffness through electrostatic attraction and frictional suppression, supported by theoretical modeling and experimental validation.

Result: Experiments validated the theoretical predictions, showing effective stiffness modulation using the proposed mechanism, and achieved successful integration into a robotic finger.

Conclusion: The HWS-ELJ mechanism provides an advanced, efficient, and practical solution for variable stiffness control in robotics through voltage-based adjustments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel variable stiffness mechanism termed Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming (HWS-ELJ) and systematically investigates its potential applications in variable stiffness robotic finger design. The proposed method utilizes electrostatic attraction to enhance interlayer friction, thereby suppressing relative sliding and enabling tunable stiffness. Compared with conventional planar ELJ, the helical configuration of HWS-ELJ provides exponentially increasing stiffness adjustment with winding angle, achieving significantly greater stiffness enhancement for the same electrode contact area while reducing the required footprint under equivalent stiffness conditions. Considering the practical advantage of voltage-based control, a series of experimental tests under different initial force conditions were conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulation characteristics of HWS-ELJ. The results demonstrated its rational design and efficacy, with outcomes following the deduced theoretical trends. Furthermore, a robotic finger prototype integrating HWS-ELJ was developed, demonstrating voltage-driven stiffness modulation and confirming the feasibility of the proposed robotic variable stiffness mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover human motion information for embodied intelligence and robotics using monocular videos, addressing the complexities found in traditional methods like SLAM pipelines or heavy temporal models.

Method: The proposed framework uses SAM 3D Body as a frozen perception backbone and Momentum HumanRig (MHR) representation. It enforces consistent skeletal parameters, applies sliding-window optimization for smoothing, and integrates physically plausible motion trajectories with a soft foot-ground contact model. A two-stage inverse kinematics pipeline is used for retargeting the motion onto a humanoid robot.

Result: The method demonstrates stable global motion trajectories and reliable humanoid robot retargeting on real monocular video data.

Conclusion: Structured human representations combined with lightweight physical constraints can effectively generate robot-compatible motion from monocular videos, providing a practical solution for robotics applications.

Abstract: Recovering world-coordinate human motion from monocular videos with humanoid robot retargeting is significant for embodied intelligence and robotics. To avoid complex SLAM pipelines or heavy temporal models, we propose a lightweight, engineering-oriented framework that leverages SAM 3D Body (3DB) as a frozen perception backbone and uses the Momentum HumanRig (MHR) representation as a robot-friendly intermediate. Our method (i) locks the identity and skeleton-scale parameters of per tracked subject to enforce temporally consistent bone lengths, (ii) smooths per-frame predictions via efficient sliding-window optimization in the low-dimensional MHR latent space, and (iii) recovers physically plausible global root trajectories with a differentiable soft foot-ground contact model and contact-aware global optimization. Finally, we retarget the reconstructed motion to the Unitree G1 humanoid using a kinematics-aware two-stage inverse kinematics pipeline. Results on real monocular videos show that our method has stable world trajectories and reliable robot retargeting, indicating that structured human representations with lightweight physical constraints can yield robot-ready motion from monocular input.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an image-centric memory framework for lifelong navigation by compressing visual contexts to enhance memory efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of object-centric memory, which lacks robustness and scalability for prolonged navigation tasks in novel and familiar environments.

Method: The method involves a visual context compression module built on DINOv3 features and a ViT backbone, integrated with a Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. It encodes image inputs into tokens to handle large visual histories efficiently.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON benchmarks, excelling in unexplored environments and optimizing paths in familiar settings.

Conclusion: Compressed image-centric memory proves efficient and scalable, supporting agents' ability to reason over extended visual contexts, ultimately aiding in human-like navigation.

Abstract: Lifelong embodied navigation requires agents to accumulate, retain, and exploit spatial-semantic experience across tasks, enabling efficient exploration in novel environments and rapid goal reaching in familiar ones. While object-centric memory is interpretable, it depends on detection and reconstruction pipelines that limit robustness and scalability. We propose an image-centric memory framework that achieves long-term implicit memory via an efficient visual context compression module end-to-end coupled with a Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. Built atop a ViT backbone with frozen DINOv3 features and lightweight PixelUnshuffle+Conv blocks, our visual tokenizer supports configurable compression rates; for example, under a representative 16$\times$ compression setting, each image is encoded with about 30 tokens, expanding the effective context capacity from tens to hundreds of images. Experimental results on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON show that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance, improving exploration in unfamiliar environments and shortening paths in familiar ones. Ablation studies further reveal that moderate compression provides the best balance between efficiency and accuracy. These findings position compressed image-centric memory as a practical and scalable interface for lifelong embodied agents, enabling them to reason over long visual histories and navigate with human-like efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of multi-robot path planning, which requires balancing global efficiency and fair task allocation while overcoming scaling and convergence issues in traditional swarm intelligence methods.

Method: A structure-induced exploration framework was developed, incorporating spatial structural priors into ACO, load-aware objectives, and an overlap suppression strategy to optimize task allocation and path planning.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved route compactness, stability, and balanced workload distribution in diverse benchmark scenarios, outperforming traditional metaheuristic approaches.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable and interpretable solution for multi-robot coordination in logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications.

Abstract: Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAction-SocialNav, a vision language model designed for socially compliant robot navigation that accommodates action ambiguity, supplemented by a new dataset and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robot navigation in human environments by addressing social norm ambiguity and social uncertainty, where multiple correct actions exist.

Method: The model leverages a meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) approach and is trained on a curated dataset comprising diverse navigation scenarios with human annotations.

Result: MAction-SocialNav exhibits high reasoning performance, safety, and efficiency in testing, significantly outperforming GPT-4o and Claude in decision quality and safety.

Conclusion: The proposed solution shows promise for real-world robot navigation by ensuring socially-aware, safe, and efficient behavior in human environments.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires robots to move safely and appropriately in human-centered environments by respecting social norms. However, social norms are often ambiguous, and in a single scenario, multiple actions may be equally acceptable. Most existing methods simplify this problem by assuming a single correct action, which limits their ability to handle real-world social uncertainty. In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations. The dataset contains 789 samples, each with three-turn conversation, split into 710 training samples and 79 test samples through random selection. We also design five evaluation metrics to assess high-level decision precision, safety, and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAction-SocialNav achieves strong social reasoning performance while maintaining high efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world human robot navigation. Compared with zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude, our model achieves substantially higher decision quality (APG: 0.595 vs. 0.000/0.025) and safety alignment (ER: 0.264 vs. 0.642/0.668), while maintaining real-time efficiency (1.524 FPS, over 3x faster).

Conclusion: The approach showcases the potential of hierarchical LLM-based architectures for planning and execution in embodied settings, focusing on accessibility and deployment feasibility.

Abstract: Embodied agents tasked with complex scenarios, whether in real or simulated environments, rely heavily on robust planning capabilities. When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask. We evaluate the proposed approach on a household task and perform real-world experiments with an embodied agent. We also focus on the use of open source LLMs with a relatively small number of parameters, to enable autonomous deployment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ANWM, an aerial navigation world model for UAVs, enhancing their autonomous navigation with semantic planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve UAV autonomous navigation by integrating high-level semantic planning into existing navigation systems.

Method: ANWM predicts future visual observations based on past frames and actions using a physics-inspired module called Future Frame Projection to enhance long-distance visual forecasting.

Result: ANWM outperforms existing models in visual prediction and boosts navigation success rates for UAVs in large environments.

Conclusion: ANWM successfully integrates semantic plausibility in UAV navigation, showcasing improved performance in large-scale spaces.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively fitting policies to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions in multitask learning.

Method: The proposed method factorizes action distributions into specialized diffusion models, enabling modular policy construction. This modular approach also allows flexible adaptation to new tasks while reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Experimentation in both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrates that this modular framework outperforms existing modular and monolithic baselines.

Conclusion: The modular diffusion policy framework offers a robust solution for modeling complex task distributions and adapting to new tasks, contributing to improved performance in robotic multitask learning.

Abstract: Multitask learning poses significant challenges due to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions. However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines.

*Shengliang Deng,Mi Yan,Yixin Zheng,Jiayi Su,Wenhao Zhang,Xiaoguang Zhao,Heming Cui,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces StereoVLA, a vision-language-action model that utilizes stereo vision for improved robotic spatial perception and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo vision has not been extensively explored in vision-language-action models despite its potential for enhancing robotic spatial perception and manipulation.

Method: The paper proposes StereoVLA, integrating a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module to fuse stereo geometric cues and semantic-rich features. It also introduces an auxiliary depth estimation task to improve spatial perception and model efficiency.

Result: Experiments show that StereoVLA significantly outperforms baseline models on various stereo-based tasks and demonstrates robustness to camera pose variations.

Conclusion: StereoVLA effectively utilizes stereo vision to enhance visual, spatial, and semantic understanding in vision-language-action models, emphasizing its potential for robotics applications.

Abstract: Stereo cameras closely mimic human binocular vision, providing rich spatial cues critical for precise robotic manipulation. Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a platform designed to enhance endotracheal intubation by integrating fiberoptic guidance with real-time depth awareness, aiming to improve safety and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current robotic and teleoperated intubation systems, which lack integrated control for tube advancement and objective verification of tube placement relative to the carina.

Method: The BRIS system incorporates a steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece. It utilizes a learning-enabled closed-loop control framework for intuitive joystick navigation and endoscopic depth estimation for safer tube placement.

Result: The system was validated on high-fidelity mannequins under both standard and difficult airway scenarios, successfully demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement.

Conclusion: BRIS shows potential as a safer and more consistent robotic airway management tool, aligning with standard clinical practices.

Abstract: Endotracheal intubation is a critical yet technically demanding procedure, with failure or improper tube placement leading to severe complications. Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.

TL;DR: CosmoCore-Evo extends CosmoCore RL framework with evolutionary algorithms, enhancing code generation adaptability and novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in RL agents' adaptability and novelty, drawing inspiration from human evolutionary processes.

Method: Incorporated evolutionary operations into RL trajectories, treating them as genomes for mutation and selection during replay phase, using specific fitness functions.

Result: Improved novelty by up to 35% and adaptation speed by 25% on benchmarks like HumanEval, BigCodeBench, and a custom pipeline.

Conclusion: CosmoCore-Evo successfully leverages evolutionary algorithms to foster emergent behaviors and improve adaptability in LLM agents.

Abstract: Building on the affective dream-replay reinforcement learning framework of CosmoCore, we introduce CosmoCore-Evo, an extension that incorporates evolutionary algorithms to enhance adaptability and novelty in code generation tasks. Inspired by anthropological aspects of human evolution, such as natural selection and adaptation in early hominids, CosmoCore-Evo treats RL trajectories as ``genomes'' that undergo mutation and selection during the nocturnal replay phase. This mechanism allows agents to break free from trained patterns, fostering emergent behaviors and improved performance in distribution-shifted environments, such as changing APIs or novel libraries. We augment the Dream Queue with evolutionary operations, including mutation of high-fitness trajectories and enterprise-tuned fitness functions that incorporate efficiency, compliance, and scalability metrics. Evaluated on extended benchmarks including HumanEval variants with shifts, BigCodeBench, and a custom PySpark pipeline simulation, CosmoCore-Evo achieves up to 35% higher novelty in solutions and 25% faster adaptation compared to the original CosmoCore and baselines like PPO and REAMER. Ablations confirm the role of evolutionary components in bridging the sentient gap for LLM agents. Code for replication, including a toy simulation, is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to measure LLM performance in practical scientific software development within real-world contexts.

Method: AInsteinBench evaluates LLMs using tasks derived from real pull requests across six scientific codebases, ensuring high scientific challenge and meaningful evaluation conditions.

Result: The benchmark provides a robust evaluation framework by leveraging multi-stage curation, expert reviews, and executable environments to examine LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: AInsteinBench is a novel tool for measuring LLMs' potential contributions to computational scientific research beyond mere code generation.

Abstract: We introduce AInsteinBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating whether large language model (LLM) agents can operate as scientific computing development agents within real research software ecosystems. Unlike existing scientific reasoning benchmarks which focus on conceptual knowledge, or software engineering benchmarks that emphasize generic feature implementation and issue resolving, AInsteinBench evaluates models in end-to-end scientific development settings grounded in production-grade scientific repositories. The benchmark consists of tasks derived from maintainer-authored pull requests across six widely used scientific codebases, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum computing, molecular dynamics, numerical relativity, fluid dynamics, and cheminformatics. All benchmark tasks are carefully curated through multi-stage filtering and expert review to ensure scientific challenge, adequate test coverage, and well-calibrated difficulty. By leveraging evaluation in executable environments, scientifically meaningful failure modes, and test-driven verification, AInsteinBench measures a model's ability to move beyond surface-level code generation toward the core competencies required for computational scientific research.

### [227] [Fairness Is Not Just Ethical: Performance Trade-Off via Data Correlation Tuning to Mitigate Bias in ML Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21348)
*Ying Xiao,Shangwen Wang,Sicen Liu,Dingyuan Xue,Xian Zhan,Yepang Liu,Jie M. Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Correlation Tuning (CoT), a pre-processing method to address bias in software systems by optimizing data correlations, improving metrics for fairness and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most bias mitigation methods are either broadly applicable but lack effectiveness or effective but narrowly applicable. There is a need for an approach addressing fairness as a software quality issue to enhance outcomes across underprivileged groups and real-world deployments.

Method: The authors propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), which focuses on mitigating data bias using the Phi-coefficient to measure correlations and employs multi-objective optimization for reducing proxy biases.

Result: CoT significantly improved performance for unprivileged groups by raising true positive rates by 17.5% on average. It also reduced bias metrics like SPD, AOD, and EOD by over 50% on average, outperforming existing methods in both single and multiple attributes scenarios.

Conclusion: CoT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bias mitigation and fairness enhancement. The release of their results and source code promotes transparency and further research in the field.

Abstract: Traditional software fairness research typically emphasizes ethical and social imperatives, neglecting that fairness fundamentally represents a core software quality issue arising directly from performance disparities across sensitive user groups. Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research.

*Sumanth Bharadwaj Hachalli Karanam,Dhiwahar Adhithya Kennady*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent framework for software beta testing, featuring vision-enabled LLMs collaborating through a voting protocol, achieving significant improvements in task success rates compared to single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual software beta testing is costly, and single-agent LLM approaches exhibit limitations like hallucinations and inconsistent behavior. The authors aim to address these issues with a more collaborative, reliable testing framework.

Method: The framework uses multiple vision-enabled LLMs with diverse behaviors that cooperate via a three-round voting protocol to test web applications systematically. Experiments were conducted with various personas, scenarios, and benchmarks.

Result: The multi-agent system showed significant success rates across different tasks, achieving improvements of 13.7 to 22.0 percentage points over single-agent methods. It demonstrated success rates of up to 100% in certain configurations, effective bug detection, and high benchmark performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework is effective in improving software testing outcomes, reducing failure rates, and enabling real-time integration testing. Its open-source nature supports further research and deployment in CI/CD processes.

Abstract: Manual software beta testing is costly and time-consuming, while single-agent large language model (LLM) approaches suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent behavior. We propose a multi-agent committee framework in which diverse vision-enabled LLMs collaborate through a three-round voting protocol to reach consensus on testing actions. The framework combines model diversity, persona-driven behavioral variation, and visual user interface understanding to systematically explore web applications. Across 84 experimental runs with 9 testing personas and 4 scenarios, multi-agent committees achieve an 89.5 percent overall task success rate. Configurations with 2 to 4 agents reach 91.7 to 100 percent success, compared to 78.0 percent for single-agent baselines, yielding improvements of 13.7 to 22.0 percentage points. At the action level, the system attains a 93.1 percent success rate with a median per-action latency of 0.71 seconds, enabling real-time and continuous integration testing. Vision-enabled agents successfully identify user interface elements, with navigation and reporting achieving 100 percent success and form filling achieving 99.2 percent success. We evaluate the framework on WebShop and OWASP benchmarks, achieving 74.7 percent success on WebShop compared to a 50.1 percent published GPT-3 baseline, and 82.0 percent success on OWASP Juice Shop security testing with coverage of 8 of the 10 OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories. Across 20 injected regressions, the committee achieves an F1 score of 0.91 for bug detection, compared to 0.78 for single-agent baselines. The open-source implementation enables reproducible research and practical deployment of LLM-based software testing in CI/CD pipelines.

### [229] [What Makes a GitHub Issue Ready for Copilot?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21426)
*Mohammed Sayagh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the quality of GitHub issues for AI-agent effectiveness and builds a model to predict their success in leading to merged pull requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers require well-written GitHub issues to maximize the effectiveness of AI-agents like Copilot. Poorly written or unclear issues diminish the likelihood of success in implementation tasks.

Method: The authors established 32 detailed criteria for GitHub issue quality, compared merged and closed pull requests, and developed an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an issue resulting in a merged pull request.

Result: The study found that well-structured, concise, and clearly scoped GitHub issues are more likely to result in merged pull requests. Issues with external dependencies or unclear guidance had lower merge rates. The machine learning model achieved a median AUC of 72%.

Conclusion: High-quality GitHub issues improve AI-agent performance. This study provides actionable insights and a predictive tool to help developers write better issues and advance research on AI-aided software engineering practices.

Abstract: AI-agents help developers in different coding tasks, such as developing new features, fixing bugs, and reviewing code. Developers can write a Github issue and assign it to an AI-agent like Copilot for implementation. Based on the issue and its related discussion, the AI-agent performs a plan for the implementation, and executes it. However, the performance of AI-agents and LLMs heavily depends on the input they receive. For instance, a GitHub issue that is unclear or not well scoped might not lead to a successful implementation that will eventually be merged. GitHub Copilot provides a set of best practice recommendations that are limited and high-level. In this paper, we build a set of 32 detailed criteria that we leverage to measure the quality of GitHub issues to make them suitable for AI-agents. We compare the GitHub issues that lead to a merged pull request versus closed pull request. Then, we build an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a GitHub issue resulting in a merged pull request. We observe that pull requests that end up being merged are those originating from issues that are shorter, well scoped, with clear guidance and hints about the relevant artifacts for an issue, and with guidance on how to perform the implementation. Issues with external references including configuration, context setup, dependencies or external APIs are associated with lower merge rates. We built an interpretable machine learning model to help users identify how to improve a GitHub issue to increase the chances of the issue resulting in a merged pull request by Copilot. Our model has a median AUC of 72\%. Our results shed light on quality metrics relevant for writing GitHub issues and motivate future studies further investigate the writing of GitHub issues as a first-class software engineering activity in the era of AI-teammates.

*Hridya Dhulipala,Xiaokai Rong,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Cerberus is an LLM-based framework that predicts runtime errors and maximizes code coverage without executing the code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting runtime errors in code snippets before integration into a codebase to improve software development efficiency and reliability.

Method: Cerberus uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate inputs for runtime errors, perform coverage prediction, and uses a two-phase feedback loop to sequentially improve coverage and error detection.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Cerberus outperforms conventional methods by generating high-coverage test cases efficiently and identifying more runtime errors.

Conclusion: Cerberus proves to be an effective and efficient execution-free alternative to traditional testing methods for detecting errors and maximizing coverage in code snippets.

Abstract: In several software development scenarios, it is desirable to detect runtime errors and exceptions in code snippets without actual execution. A typical example is to detect runtime exceptions in online code snippets before integrating them into a codebase. In this paper, we propose Cerberus, a novel predictive, execution-free coverage-guided testing framework. Cerberus uses LLMs to generate the inputs that trigger runtime errors and to perform code coverage prediction and error detection without code execution. With a two-phase feedback loop, Cerberus first aims to both increasing code coverage and detecting runtime errors, then shifts to focus only detecting runtime errors when the coverage reaches 100% or its maximum, enabling it to perform better than prompting the LLMs for both purposes. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cerberus performs better than conventional and learning-based testing frameworks for (in)complete code snippets by generating high-coverage test cases more efficiently, leading to the discovery of more runtime errors.

### [231] [Fuzzwise: Intelligent Initial Corpus Generation for Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21440)
*Hridya Dhulipala,Xiaokai Rong,Aashish Yadavally,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FuzzWise, a new approach to fuzzing, uses Large Language Models (LLMs) in a combined process to generate an optimized initial corpus of seeds efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively fuzzing requires high-quality input seeds; current methods require separate phases of generation and minimization.

Method: FuzzWise uses a two-agent LLM framework: one agent generates test cases and the other evaluates their contribution to code coverage without actual execution.

Result: FuzzWise produces fewer test cases, achieves higher code coverage, uncovers more runtime errors, and saves time and computational resources compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FuzzWise proves efficient in generating an optimal initial corpus while improving coverage and error detection, addressing computational and execution challenges.

Abstract: In mutation-based greybox fuzzing, generating high-quality input seeds for the initial corpus is essential for effective fuzzing. Rather than conducting separate phases for generating a large corpus and subsequently minimizing it, we propose FuzzWise which integrates them into one process to generate the optimal initial corpus of seeds (ICS). FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines. Moreover, it is more time-efficient and coverage-efficient in producing an initial corpus catching more errors.

*Takuto Kawamoto,Yoshiki Higo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a C#-specific approach for the "Extract Method" refactoring technique using lambda expressions, which successfully consolidates a portion of code clones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research on behavior parameterization and code clone consolidation methods in programming languages other than Java, particularly for C#. The study aims to fill this gap.

Method: The method involves a C#-specific refactoring technique using lambda expressions, applied to code clones identified by the NiCad clone detector. Suitability for refactoring and the success rate of refactoring were evaluated.

Result: Using 2,217 clone pairs from 22 projects, the method determined 35.0% of clones were suitable for refactoring, and 28.9% of these were successfully refactored.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the potential and limitations of using lambda expressions for code clone consolidation in C#, but further development and exploration are needed for higher refactoring success rates and applicability.

Abstract: "Extract Method" refactoring is a technique for consolidating code clones. Parameterization approaches are used to extract a single method from multiple code clones that contain differences. This approach parameterizes expressions and behaviors within a method. In particular, behavior parameterization has been extensively studied in Java programs, but little research has been conducted on other programming languages.
  Lambda expressions can be used to parameterize behaviors, but the specifications of each programming language significantly affect the applicability of this technique. Therefore, the optimal "Extract Method" approach may vary depending on the programming language.
  In this study, we propose a C#-specific technique that uses lambda expressions to analyze and consolidate code clones. We evaluated our proposed method by applying it to code clones detected by the NiCad clone detector and measuring how many of them could be successfully consolidated.
  In total, 2,217 clone pairs from 22 projects were included in our evaluation. For the clone pairs determined to be refactorable, we also attempted refactoring actually. The proposed approach determined that 35.0% of all clone pairs were suitable for refactoring. Among these, 28.9% were successfully refactored.

*Qi Hu,Jiangchao Liu,Xin Yu,Lin Zhang,Edward Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: XTrace is a high-performance, stable dynamic tracing tool for Android apps, optimizing runtime observability without modifying core virtual machine structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of mobile apps and fragmented user environments have made ensuring app stability increasingly challenging. Traditional debugging methods fail to capture real-time contextual information, especially for elusive 'ghost bugs' that occur in specific scenarios.

Method: XTrace utilizes non-invasive proxying for method interception on the Android ART virtual machine. It leverages built-in instrumentation mechanisms to optimize runtime tracing, ensuring compatibility across Android versions while maintaining minimal performance overhead.

Result: XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability in a ByteDance app with hundreds of millions of daily active users. It showed negligible impact on app stability (Crash User Rate/ANR rate) and minimal performance overhead. It also diagnosed severe bugs and improved root-cause localization efficiency by over 90%.

Conclusion: XTrace offers a reliable and efficient solution for dynamic runtime observability in Android apps, balancing stability and tracing capability. It addresses long-standing challenges in debugging complex app environments.

Abstract: As the complexity of mobile applications grows exponentially and the fragmentation of user device environments intensifies, ensuring online application stability faces unprecedented challenges. Traditional methods, such as static logging and post-crash analysis, lack real-time contextual information, rendering them ineffective against "ghost bugs" that only manifest in specific scenarios. This highlights an urgent need for dynamic runtime observability: intercepting and tracing arbitrary methods in production without requiring an app release. We propose XTrace, a novel dynamic tracing framework. XTrace introduces a new paradigm of non-invasive proxying, which avoids direct modification of the virtual machine's underlying data structures. It achieves high-performance method interception by leveraging and optimizing the highly stable, built-in instrumentation mechanism of the Android ART virtual machine. Evaluated in a ByteDance application with hundreds of millions of daily active users, XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability and performance. Large-scale online A/B experiments confirmed its stability, showing no statistically significant impact (p > 0.05) on Crash User Rate or ANR rate, while maintaining minimal overhead (<7 ms startup latency, <0.01 ms per-method call) and broad compatibility (Android 5.0-15+). Critically, XTrace diagnosed over 11 severe online crashes and multiple performance bottlenecks, improving root-cause localization efficiency by over 90%. This confirms XTrace provides a production-grade solution that reconciles the long-standing conflict between stability and comprehensive coverage in Android dynamic tracing.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents \methodName, a repository-level type inference approach using LLMs and iterative refinement strategies to tackle runtime type errors in Python's dynamic typing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges with runtime type errors from Python's dynamic typing in complex software inspire the need for automated repository-level type inference techniques.

Method: \methodName uses an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model types and dependencies, iteratively refines them, and employs a type-checker-in-the-loop to validate and ensure accuracy during type inference.

Result: \methodName significantly outperformed prior methods across 12 Python repositories, achieving major improvements in TypeSim and TypeExact scores and reducing new type errors by 92.7%.

Conclusion: \methodName represents a significant advancement toward scalable, automated, and reliable type annotation in Python repositories, making it promising for real-world usage.

Abstract: Python's dynamic typing mechanism, while promoting flexibility, is a significant source of runtime type errors that plague large-scale software, which inspires the automatic type inference techniques. Existing type inference tools have achieved advances in type inference within isolated code snippets. However, repository-level type inference remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the complex inter-procedural dependencies that are difficult to model and resolve. To fill this gap, we present \methodName, a novel approach based on LLMs that achieves repository-level type inference through the co-evolution of types and dependencies. \methodName~constructs an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model the objects and type dependencies across the repository. During the inference process, it iteratively refines types and dependencies in EDG for accurate type inference. Our key innovations are: (1) an EDG model designed to capture repository-level type dependencies; (2) an iterative type inference approach where types and dependencies co-evolve in each iteration; and (3) a type-checker-in-the-loop strategy that validates and corrects inferences on-the-fly, thereby reducing error propagation. When evaluated on 12 complex Python repositories, \methodName~significantly outperformed prior works, achieving a \textit{TypeSim} score of 0.89 and a \textit{TypeExact} score of 0.84, representing a 27\% and 40\% relative improvement over the strongest baseline. More importantly, \methodName~removed new type errors introduced by the tool by 92.7\%. This demonstrates a significant leap towards automated, reliable type annotation for real-world Python development.

*Huiyun Peng,Antonio Zhong,Ricardo Andrés Calvo Méndez,Kelechi G. Kalu,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates AI coding agents in performance optimization tasks and compares their work with human-authored efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness and characteristics of AI coding agents in the realm of real-world performance optimization compared to human developers.

Method: Analyzed 324 agent-generated and 83 human-authored performance optimization pull requests (PRs) from the AIDev dataset focusing on adoption, maintainability, optimization patterns, and validation practices.

Result: Found that AI-authored PRs are less likely to include explicit performance validation (45.7% vs. 63.6%) and use similar optimization patterns as human-authored PRs.

Conclusion: AI coding agents show potential but lack performance validation practices seen in human-authored work, suggesting areas for improvement in agentic optimization tasks.

Abstract: Performance optimization is a critical yet challenging aspect of software development, often requiring a deep understanding of system behavior, algorithmic tradeoffs, and careful code modifications. Although recent advances in AI coding agents have accelerated code generation and bug fixing, little is known about how these agents perform on real-world performance optimization tasks. We present the first empirical study comparing agent- and human-authored performance optimization commits, analyzing 324 agent-generated and 83 human-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across adoption, maintainability, optimization patterns, and validation practices. We find that AI-authored performance PRs are less likely to include explicit performance validation than human-authored PRs (45.7\% vs. 63.6\%, $p=0.007$). In addition, AI-authored PRs largely use the same optimization patterns as humans. We further discuss limitations and opportunities for advancing agentic code optimization.

Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the robustness, maturity, and challenges of SPDX and CycloneDX tool ecosystems, which are critical for SBOM adoption and software supply chain transparency.

Method: The authors conducted a quantitative comparison of 170 SBOM tools, analyzed 36,990 issue reports from open-source tools, and examined the top 250 projects using both ecosystems to assess health metrics.

Conclusion: Both ecosystems have complementary strengths. This research helps developers and practitioners understand the unique attributes and potential areas of improvement for SPDX and CycloneDX SBOM formats.

Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides transparency by documenting software component metadata and dependencies. However, SBOM adoption depends on tool ecosystems. With two dominant formats: SPDX and CycloneDX - the ecosystems vary significantly in maturity, tool support, and community engagement. We conduct a quantitative comparison of use cases for 170 publicly advertised SBOM tools, identifying enhancement areas for each format. We compare health metrics of both ecosystems (171 CycloneDX versus 470 SPDX tools) to evaluate robustness and maturity. We quantitatively compare 36,990 issue reports from open-source tools to identify challenges and development opportunities. Finally, we investigate the top 250 open-source projects using each tool ecosystem and compare their health metrics. Our findings reveal distinct characteristics: projects using CycloneDX tools demonstrate higher developer engagement and certain health indicators, while SPDX tools benefit from a more mature ecosystem with broader tool availability and established industry adoption. This research provides insights for developers, contributors, and practitioners regarding complementary strengths of these ecosystems and identifies opportunities for mutual enhancement.

### [237] [A Story About Cohesion and Separation: Label-Free Metric for Log Parser Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21811)
*Qiaolin Qin,Jianchen Zhao,Heng Li,Weiyi Shang,Ettore Merlo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study proposes PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), a label-free metric to evaluate log parser performance, addressing the inconsistencies and label-dependence of current metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing log parser evaluation heavily depends on labeled log data, causing limitations like restricted datasets and inconsistent performance conclusions.

Method: PMSS assesses parser quality using medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance, operating with near-linear time complexity.

Result: PMSS shows strong positive correlation with established metrics (FGA, FTA) and provides consistent results even without relying on labeled data.

Conclusion: PMSS is a reliable and alternative evaluation metric for log parsers, especially useful when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Abstract: Log parsing converts log messages into structured event templates, allowing for automated log analysis and reducing manual inspection effort. To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that different versions of ground-truth used in existing studies can lead to inconsistent performance conclusions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel label-free template-level metric, PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), to evaluate log parser performance. PMSS evaluates both parser grouping and template quality with medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance within a near-linear time complexity in general. To understand its relationship with label-based template-level metrics, FGA and FTA, we compared their evaluation outcomes for six log parsers on the standard corrected Loghub 2.0 dataset. Our results indicate that log parsers achieving the highest PMSS or FGA exhibit comparable performance, differing by only 2.1% on average in terms of the FGA score; the difference is 9.8% for FTA. PMSS is also significantly (p<1e-8) and positively correlated to both FGA and FTA: the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient of PMSS-FGA and PMSS-FTA are respectively 0.648 and 0.587, close to the coefficient between FGA and FTA (0.670). We further extended our discussion on how to interpret the conclusions from different metrics, identifying challenges in using PMSS, and provided guidelines on conducting parser selections with our metric. PMSS provides a valuable evaluation alternative when ground-truths are inconsistent or labels are unavailable.

*Brian Bowers,Smita Khapre,Jugal Kalita*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent system architecture for software engineering, analyzes its vulnerabilities, and suggests improvements through a security-focused agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the shift from reactive AI content generation to goal-driven and more autonomous multi-agent AI systems, and assess their productivity and vulnerabilities in a practical domain: software engineering.

Method: The authors designed and analyzed multiple architectures (coder, coder-tester, coder-reviewer-tester) of multi-agent systems in software engineering, integrated a security analysis agent, and evaluated their performance with a focus on resiliency and efficiency. They also tested code injection vulnerability by embedding malicious inputs.

Result: The paper concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient but less efficient, and that adding a security analysis agent improves resilience and mitigates efficiency losses. However, such systems remain vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, with attack success rates increasing to 71.95% with specially-crafted inputs.

Conclusion: Although multi-agent systems show potential in software engineering, they face significant security challenges. A security analysis agent can improve resilience without sacrificing efficiency but requires enhanced measures to defend against sophisticated attacks like advanced code injection.

Abstract: Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems are poised to dominate industry and society imminently. Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new binary program analysis framework to enhance usability and performance in fine-grained analysis, utilizing kernel modules and process hollowing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The framework addresses challenges of deployability, performance overhead, and memory usage in fine-grained binary analysis, aiming to better handle scenarios like memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware.

Method: It utilizes a kernel module to enhance dynamic binary instrumentation and employs process hollowing techniques for decoupling analysis in a containerized environment.

Result: The prototype framework was implemented on Windows, tested with benchmarks, real-world programs, exploit analysis, and malicious code, proving its validity, performance, and practical application.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in binary analysis while minimizing performance impact, showcasing its potential in addressing real-world security threats.

Abstract: Binary program analysis is still very important in system security. There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs. The effectiveness of the framework is also verified by the analysis of actual exploit programs and malicious code, demonstrating the value of the practical application.

*Ece Öner,Cenk Denktaş*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores how metabolic constraints affect neural network dynamics using a conductance-based spiking neural network model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in standard spiking neural network models where metabolic constraints are ignored, by studying how metabolism influences neural activity and plasticity.

Method: A conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire (gLIF) microcircuit with 5,000 neurons was developed in Brian2, using temperature-dependent Q10 scaling to couple metabolic state with neural properties.

Result: Five emergent properties were revealed: dynamical bifurcation in learning, deformation of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), signal degradation due to saturation, topological shifts in firing patterns, and robustness of findings across different configurations.

Conclusion: Metabolic constraints regulate learning and stability in neural networks, exhibiting an inverted-U relationship between bioenergetics and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Standard Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models typically neglect metabolic constraints, treating neurons as energetically unconstrained components. We bridge this gap by implementing a conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire (gLIF) microcircuit (N=5,000) in Brian2, using temperature-dependent Q10 scaling to as a biophysically grounded proxy to couple metabolic state with intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity. Our simulations revealed five distinct emergent properties: (1) Dynamics Bifurcation: Learning trajectories diverged significantly, with hypometabolic states plateauing near baseline and hypermetabolic states exhibiting non-linear, runaway potentiation; (2) STDP Window Deformation: Thermal stress structurally deformed the plasticity kernel, where hypermetabolism sharpened coincidence detection and hypometabolism flattened synaptic integration; (3) Signal Degradation: While metabolic rate positively correlated with connectivity strength, high-energy states caused synaptic saturation and a loss of sparse coding specificity; (4) Topological Shift: Network activity transitioned from sparse, asynchronous firing in energy-restricted states to pathological, seizure-like hypersynchronization in high-energy states ; and (5) Parametric Robustness: Sensitivity analysis confirmed these attractor states were intrinsic biophysical properties, robust across random network initializations. Collectively, these results define an "inverted-U" relationship between bioenergetics and learning, demonstrating that metabolic constraints are necessary hardware regulators for network stability.

*P. O. Michel,C. Sun,S. Jaffard,D. Longrois,D. Holcman*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A model framework represents transient oscillations as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with simple, interpretable parameters, focusing on EEG dynamics during anesthesia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a compact, generative model that captures the transient structure of physiological burst-like oscillations.

Method: Proposed a combination of parameter-estimation strategies using spectral fitting, burst event segmentation, and statistical matching to characterize transient oscillations, extended for complex and multi-frequency scenarios.

Result: The model accurately identifies alpha-spindle activity in EEG signals during anesthesia, showing low error and interpreting state changes beyond traditional metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a sparse, interpretable representation of transient oscillations, improving brain monitoring tools via clear metrics and dynamic tracking.

Abstract: Stochastic burst-like oscillations are common in physiological signals, yet there are few compact generative models that capture their transient structure. We propose a numerical-twin framework that represents transient narrowband activity as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with three interpretable parameters: decay rate, mean frequency, and noise amplitude. We develop two complementary estimation strategies. The first fits the power spectral density, amplitude distribution, and autocorrelation to recover OU-parameters. The second segments burst events and performs a statistical match between empirical spindle statistics (duration, amplitude, inter-event interval) and simulated OU output via grid search, resolving parameter degeneracies by including event counts. We extend the framework to multiple frequency bands and piecewise-stationary dynamics to track slow parameter drifts. Applied to electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia, the method identifies OU models that reproduce alpha-spindle (8-12 Hz) morphology and band-limited spectra with low residual error, enabling real-time tracking of state changes that are not apparent from band power alone. This decomposition yields a sparse, interpretable representation of transient oscillations and provides interpretable metrics for brain monitoring.

### [243] [Learning continually with representational drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22045)
*Suzanne van der Veldt,Gido M. van de Ven,Sanne Moorman,Guillaume Etter*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Current deep learning struggles in dealing with sequential or non-stationary tasks due to forgetting. This paper explores how 'representational drift' in biological neural networks could inspire better continual learning in artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of continual learning in deep neural networks, particularly the balance between stability (retaining past information) and plasticity (adapting to new knowledge) inspired by biological neural systems.

Method: This paper examines 'representational drift' in biological systems, its connection to continual learning, and potential integration into artificial neural systems. It emphasizes understanding the natural behavior of drift mediated by synaptic plasticity and its accumulation across brain regions.

Result: The results highlight that while representational drift may seem contradictory to stability, it holds potential insights for continual learning. Drift could emerge naturally in artificial networks that promote both plasticity and forgetting mitigation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that representational drift is a byproduct, not a solution, to incremental learning challenges, but studying it could offer valuable insights to improve continual learning in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Deep artificial neural networks famously struggle to learn from non-stationary streams of data. Without dedicated mitigation strategies, continual learning is associated with continuous forgetting of previous tasks and a progressive loss of plasticity. Current approaches to continual learning have either focused on increasing the stability of representations of past tasks, or on promoting plasticity for future learning. Paradoxically, while animals including humans achieve a desirable stability-plasticity trade-off, the responses of biological neurons to external stimuli that are associated with stable behaviors gradually change over time. This suggests that, although unstable representations have historically been seen as undesirable in artificial systems, they could be a core property of biological neural networks learning continually. Here, we examine how linking representational drift to continual learning in biological neural networks could inform artificial systems. We highlight the existence of representational drift across numerous animal species and brain regions and propose that drift reflects a mixture of homeostatic turnover and learning-related synaptic plasticity. In particular, we evaluate how plasticity induced by learning new tasks could induce drift in the representation of previous tasks, and how such drift could accumulate across brain regions. In deep artificial neural networks, we propose that representational drift is only compatible with approaches that do not explicitly prevent parameter changes to mitigate forgetting. Remarkably, jointly promoting plasticity while mitigating forgetting could in principle induce representational drift in continual learning. While we argue that drift is a byproduct rather than a solution to incremental learning, its investigation could inform approaches to continual learning in artificial systems.

### [244] [An approach to Fisher-Rao metric for infinite dimensional non-parametric information geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21451)
*Bing Cheng,Howell Tong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework to manage the challenges of non-parametric information geometry using a finite-dimensional Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), enabling advancements in explainable AI and intrinsic dimensionality estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intractability of infinite-dimensional non-parametric information geometry, particularly around the Fisher-Rao metric and its inverse.

Method: The authors propose an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space and define the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), proving its connection with statistical measures like G-entropy and KL-divergence curvature.

Result: The framework establishes cFIM as a practical tool to measure statistical information, links Fisher Information to efficiency bounds, and applies these findings to the Manifold Hypothesis and intrinsic dimensionality estimation.

Conclusion: The study closes the gap between abstract theoretical geometry and practical explainable AI by offering mechanisms for statistical coverage and efficiency of non-parametric models.

Abstract: Being infinite dimensional, non-parametric information geometry has long faced an "intractability barrier" due to the fact that the Fisher-Rao metric is now a functional incurring difficulties in defining its inverse. This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \oplus S^{\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cramér-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data. In short, our work bridges the gap between abstract information geometry and the demand of explainable AI, by providing a tractable path for revealing the statistical coverage and the efficiency of non-parametric models.

### [245] [Residual Prior Diffusion: A Probabilistic Framework Integrating Coarse Latent Priors with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21593)
*Takuro Kutsuna*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a framework for improving generative performance by dividing modeling tasks into two stages: capturing large-scale structures and representing finer local details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing both global structures and fine-grained local variations in data distributions, especially when these scales are mismatched.

Method: Introduces a two-stage framework (RPD)—a coarse prior model captures large-scale features while a diffusion model learns residuals between the prior and target data. RPD is formulated as a probabilistic model with tractable optimization and uses auxiliary variables for efficiency.

Result: Experiments show RPD better captures fine-scale details in synthetic datasets compared to standard diffusion models and achieves or exceeds baseline performance on natural image tasks with fewer computation steps.

Conclusion: RPD effectively addresses the shortcomings of standard diffusion models by leveraging a two-stage design, improving both efficiency and generative performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a central tool in deep generative modeling, but standard formulations rely on a single network and a single diffusion schedule to transform a simple prior, typically a standard normal distribution, into the target data distribution. As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.

### [246] [Tilt Matching for Scalable Sampling and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21829)
*Peter Potaptchik,Cheuk-Kit Lee,Michael S. Albergo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Tilt Matching,' a new algorithm for sampling from unnormalized densities and fine-tuning generative models, which achieves state-of-the-art results effectively and scalably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a scalable, efficient algorithm that optimizes sampling from unnormalized densities and improves the fine-tuning of generative models, addressing limitations in current methods.

Method: Tilt Matching is based on a dynamical equation connecting the flow matching velocity to a tilted distribution. It solves a stochastic optimal control problem without requiring gradient access or backpropagation, leveraging stochastic interpolants for efficiency.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results in sampling under Lennard-Jones potentials and performs competitively when fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Tilt Matching is a high-performing, scalable approach for sampling and fine-tuning, providing a theoretically sound and practical solution for optimizing generative models.

Abstract: We propose a simple, scalable algorithm for using stochastic interpolants to sample from unnormalized densities and for fine-tuning generative models. The approach, Tilt Matching, arises from a dynamical equation relating the flow matching velocity to one targeting the same distribution tilted by a reward, implicitly solving a stochastic optimal control problem. The new velocity inherits the regularity of stochastic interpolant transports while also being the minimizer of an objective with strictly lower variance than flow matching itself. The update to the velocity field can be interpreted as the sum of all joint cumulants of the stochastic interpolant and copies of the reward, and to first order is their covariance. The algorithms do not require any access to gradients of the reward or backpropagating through trajectories of the flow or diffusion. We empirically verify that the approach is efficient and highly scalable, providing state-of-the-art results on sampling under Lennard-Jones potentials and is competitive on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, without requiring reward multipliers. It can also be straightforwardly applied to tilting few-step flow map models.

Result: MASFIN achieved a 7.33% cumulative return over eight weeks, outperforming benchmarks like S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones in six out of eight weeks, though with higher volatility.

Conclusion: MASFIN demonstrates the potential of modular, bias-aware generative AI frameworks for improving transparency, reproducibility, and performance in quantitative finance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are transforming data-intensive domains, with finance representing a high-stakes environment where transparent and reproducible analysis of heterogeneous signals is essential. Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.

*Stefano M. Iacus,Haodong Qi,Marcello Carammia,Thomas Juneau*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynAttn, a dynamic-attention framework, to forecast conflict-related fatalities and outperforms competing models, particularly in sparse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting conflict-related fatalities is challenging due to the non-stationary, sparse, and bursty nature of violence data. Better tools are needed for accurate and interpretable predictions.

Method: DynAttn integrates rolling-window estimation, elastic-net-based feature gating, a compact self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial likelihood to produce calibrated and interpretable multi-horizon forecasts.

Result: DynAttn is tested using global and high-resolution conflict data, showing better performance than competing methods (e.g., DynENet, LSTM, Prophet) across various forecast horizons, particularly in sparse grid-level data.

Conclusion: DynAttn not only improves prediction accuracy for conflict-related fatalities but also enhances the interpretability of conflict dynamics, emphasizing factors like short-run conflict persistence, spatial diffusion, and climate stress.

Abstract: Forecasting conflict-related fatalities remains a central challenge in political science and policy analysis due to the sparse, bursty, and highly non-stationary nature of violence data. We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures.
  We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply.
  Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.

Result: Empirical evaluations show significant improvements in security, policy compliance, and functionality correctness in secure code generation tasks, with minimal runtime impact.

Conclusion: Reflection-Driven Control offers a practical and effective framework for creating autonomous, safer, and trustworthy AI coding agents.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM) agents are remarkably capable, but they still lack reliable safety controls and can produce unconstrained, unpredictable, and even actively harmful outputs. To address this, we introduce Reflection-Driven Control, a standardized and pluggable control module that can be seamlessly integrated into general agent architectures. Reflection-Driven Control elevates "self-reflection" from a post hoc patch into an explicit step in the agent's own reasoning process: during generation, the agent continuously runs an internal reflection loop that monitors and evaluates its own decision path. When potential risks are detected, the system retrieves relevant repair examples and secure coding guidelines from an evolving reflective memory, injecting these evidence-based constraints directly into subsequent reasoning steps. We instantiate Reflection-Driven Control in the setting of secure code generation and systematically evaluate it across eight classes of security-critical programming tasks. Empirical results show that Reflection-Driven Control substantially improves the security and policy compliance of generated code while largely preserving functional correctness, with minimal runtime and token overhead. Taken together, these findings indicate that Reflection-Driven Control is a practical path toward trustworthy AI coding agents: it enables designs that are simultaneously autonomous, safer by construction, and auditable.

### [251] [Exploring the Security Threats of Retriever Backdoors in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21681)
*Tian Li,Bo Lin,Shangwen Wang,Yusong Tan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores a critical security vulnerability in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) by introducing a stealthy backdoor attack, VenomRACG, which bypasses current defenses and demonstrates serious impact on code generation accuracy and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate the overlooked security implications of Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), specifically the vulnerability introduced through backdoor attacks on retriever components.

Method: The study introduces a new attack method, VenomRACG, designed to produce poisoned samples statistically indistinguishable from benign code, thus bypassing existing defense mechanisms. The method was tested for its detectability and impact on code retrieval and generation systems.

Result: VenomRACG achieves a 51.29% success rate in influencing retrievers to rank vulnerable code in top-5 results, causing models like GPT-4o to generate vulnerable code in over 40% of scenarios while keeping overall system performance unchanged.

Conclusion: Retriever backdooring poses a real and severe threat to RACG systems, which current detection and defense mechanisms fail to address. This emphasizes the need for more robust security measures in software development tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is increasingly adopted to enhance Large Language Models for software development, yet its security implications remain dangerously underexplored. This paper conducts the first systematic exploration of a critical and stealthy threat: backdoor attacks targeting the retriever component, which represents a significant supply-chain vulnerability. It is infeasible to assess this threat realistically, as existing attack methods are either too ineffective to pose a real danger or are easily detected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms spanning both latent-space analysis and token-level inspection, which achieve consistently high detection rates. To overcome this barrier and enable a realistic analysis, we first developed VenomRACG, a new class of potent and stealthy attack that serves as a vehicle for our investigation. Its design makes poisoned samples statistically indistinguishable from benign code, allowing the attack to consistently maintain low detectability across all evaluated defense mechanisms. Armed with this capability, our exploration reveals a severe vulnerability: by injecting vulnerable code equivalent to only 0.05% of the entire knowledge base size, an attacker can successfully manipulate the backdoored retriever to rank the vulnerable code in its top-5 results in 51.29% of cases. This translates to severe downstream harm, causing models like GPT-4o to generate vulnerable code in over 40% of targeted scenarios, while leaving the system's general performance intact. Our findings establish that retriever backdooring is not a theoretical concern but a practical threat to the software development ecosystem that current defenses are blind to, highlighting the urgent need for robust security measures.

*Tianwei Lan,Farid Naït-Abdesselam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents LAMLAD, an adversarial attack framework leveraging large language models to evade Android malware detection systems, achieving high attack success rates and proposing a defense strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in ML-based Android malware detection systems, which are susceptible to adversarial attacks that manipulate feature-level attributes to evade detection.

Method: Introduces LAMLAD, utilizing a dual-agent LLM-based framework with a manipulator and analyzer alongside retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to craft effective adversarial samples against malware detection models.

Result: LAMLAD achieves up to a 97% attack success rate with high efficiency and adaptability, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of LLM-powered adversarial attacks while the proposed training-based defense enhances robustness, signifying the need for more secure malware detection mechanisms.

Abstract: The rapid growth in both the scale and complexity of Android malware has driven the widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques for scalable and accurate malware detection. Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that introduce carefully crafted feature-level perturbations to evade detection while preserving malicious functionality. In this paper, we present LAMLAD, a novel adversarial attack framework that exploits the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to bypass ML-based Android malware classifiers. LAMLAD employs a dual-agent architecture composed of an LLM manipulator, which generates realistic and functionality-preserving feature perturbations, and an LLM analyzer, which guides the perturbation process toward successful evasion. To improve efficiency and contextual awareness, LAMLAD integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the LLM pipeline. Focusing on Drebin-style feature representations, LAMLAD enables stealthy and high-confidence attacks against widely deployed Android malware detection systems. We evaluate LAMLAD against three representative ML-based Android malware detectors and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMLAD achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of up to 97%, requiring on average only three attempts per adversarial sample, highlighting its effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability in practical adversarial settings. Furthermore, we propose an adversarial training-based defense strategy that reduces the ASR by more than 30% on average, significantly enhancing model robustness against LAMLAD-style attacks.

*Sunil Arora,John Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SC-NLP-LMF framework for secure, compliant lifecycle management of NLP systems in sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, security, and compliance issues in NLP systems, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: Developed a six-phase framework called SC-NLP-LMF, based on a PRISMA review of 45 sources, and aligned with standards like NIST and ISO.

Result: The framework integrates bias detection, differential privacy, federated learning, and explainability for secure and compliant NLP systems.

Conclusion: SC-NLP-LMF supports the development and maintenance of secure NLP systems, demonstrated via a healthcare use case for terminology drift and model updates.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and government, where they handle large volumes of personal and regulated data. However, these systems introduce distinct risks related to security, privacy, and regulatory compliance that are not fully addressed by existing AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces the Secure and Compliant NLP Lifecycle Management Framework (SC-NLP-LMF), a comprehensive six-phase model designed to ensure the secure operation of NLP systems from development to retirement. The framework, developed through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources, aligns with leading standards, including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS. It integrates established methods for bias detection, privacy protection (differential privacy, federated learning), secure deployment, explainability, and secure model decommissioning. A healthcare case study illustrates how SC-NLP-LMF detects emerging terminology drift (e.g., COVID-related language) and guides compliant model updates. The framework offers organizations a practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.

### [254] [Assessing the Effectiveness of Membership Inference on Generative Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21762)
*Kurtis Chow,Omar Samiullah,Vinesh Sridhar,Hewen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies the effectiveness of membership inference attacks (MIAs) on generative music models, identifying privacy and copyright concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of research on MIAs specifics for generative music within the music industry's billion-dollar economy, aiming to address user privacy and intellectual property concerns.

Method: The authors evaluate multiple existing membership inference attack techniques on MuseGAN, a well-known generative music model.

Result: The study finds music data is fairly resilient to known membership inference techniques.

Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest generative music models are less vulnerable to MIAs, addressing privacy and copyright concerns but warranting further exploration.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are quickly improving, now able to produce believable output in several modalities including images, text, and audio. However, this fast development has prompted increased scrutiny concerning user privacy and the use of copyrighted works in training. A recent attack on machine-learning models called membership inference lies at the crossroads of these two concerns. The attack is given as input a set of records and a trained model and seeks to identify which of those records may have been used to train the model. On one hand, this attack can be used to identify user data used to train a model, which may violate their privacy especially in sensitive applications such as models trained on medical data. On the other hand, this attack can be used by rights-holders as evidence that a company used their works without permission to train a model.
  Remarkably, it appears that no work has studied the effect of membership inference attacks (MIA) on generative music. Given that the music industry is worth billions of dollars and artists would stand to gain from being able to determine if their works were being used without permission, we believe this is a pressing issue to study. As such, in this work we begin a preliminary study into whether MIAs are effective on generative music. We study the effect of several existing attacks on MuseGAN, a popular and influential generative music model. Similar to prior work on generative audio MIAs, our findings suggest that music data is fairly resilient to known membership inference techniques.

TL;DR: A new deep learning-enhanced multiplexed diagnostic system (xVFA) offers rapid, accurate, and multi-biomarker quantification for cardiovascular disease at the point of care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for timely and accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction and heart failure, which often coexist and contribute to high mortality rates.

Method: Development of a dual-mode optical sensor (xVFA) incorporating colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection, enabled by a neural network-based quantification pipeline.

Result: xVFA demonstrated high sensitivity and robust quantification of multiple cardiac biomarkers within clinically relevant ranges, achieving Pearson's r > 0.96 compared to reference assays.

Conclusion: The proposed xVFA system enables comprehensive, rapid, and cost-effective point-of-care cardiovascular diagnostics.

Abstract: Rapid and accessible cardiac biomarker testing is essential for the timely diagnosis and risk assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), two interrelated conditions that frequently coexist and drive recurrent hospitalizations with high mortality. However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r > 0.96 vs. reference assays). By combining high sensitivity, multiplexing, and automation in a compact and cost-effective optical sensor format, the dual-mode xVFA enables rapid and quantitative cardiovascular diagnostics at the point of care.

### [256] [A Frobenius-Optimal Projection for Enforcing Linear Conservation in Learned Dynamical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22084)
*John M. Mango,Ronald Katende*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: This paper addresses embedding conservation laws in linear dynamical models by projecting learned operators onto invariant-conforming spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To restore conservation laws in data-driven models, ensuring correctness and preserving underlying invariants.

Method: The authors propose orthogonal projection to refine learned operators while adhering to invariant constraints.

Result: The proposed correction guarantees exact conservation minimally perturbing the system, validated by numerical examples.

Conclusion: Embedding exact invariants is achievable in linear models using this projection method, which is efficient and well-defined.

Abstract: We consider the problem of restoring linear conservation laws in data-driven linear dynamical models. Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A}$. This correction is uniquely defined, low rank and fully determined by the violation $C^\top \widehat{A}$. In the single-invariant case it reduces to a rank-one update. We prove that $A^\star$ enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, and we verify these properties numerically on a Markov-type example. The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model.

### [257] [Selective LLM-Guided Regularization for Enhancing Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21526)
*Shanglin Yang,Zhan Shi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, Selective LLM Guided Regularization, which efficiently leverages large language models (LLMs) for recommendation systems by selectively using their guidance in pairwise ranking scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of using LLMs for recommendation suffer from being expensive, unreliable, or globally enforcing LLM predictions, even when inaccurate.

Method: A gating mechanism, informed by user history, item popularity, and uncertainty predictions, activates LLM-based ranking only in reliable cases; all LLM scoring is conducted offline to minimize costs.

Result: The selective strategy improves accuracy across datasets, showing significant gains in challenging cases such as cold start scenarios and long-tail recommendations.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that selectively using LLM guidance with a tailored mechanism achieves better recommendation performance and addresses flaws in prior approaches.

Abstract: Large language models provide rich semantic priors and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising auxiliary signals for recommendation. However, prevailing approaches either deploy LLMs as standalone recommender or apply global knowledge distillation, both of which suffer from inherent drawbacks. Standalone LLM recommender are costly, biased, and unreliable across large regions of the user item space, while global distillation forces the downstream model to imitate LLM predictions even when such guidance is inaccurate. Meanwhile, recent studies show that LLMs excel particularly in re-ranking and challenging scenarios, rather than uniformly across all contexts.We introduce Selective LLM Guided Regularization, a model-agnostic and computation efficient framework that activates LLM based pairwise ranking supervision only when a trainable gating mechanism informing by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty predicts the LLM to be reliable. All LLM scoring is performed offline, transferring knowledge without increasing inference cost. Experiments across multiple datasets show that this selective strategy consistently improves overall accuracy and yields substantial gains in cold start and long tail regimes, outperforming global distillation baselines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models to address data sparsity and noise in Item-to-Item recommendation systems, improving recommendation accuracy and real-world metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of Item-to-Item recommendation systems by addressing limitations of current model-centric and data-centric approaches, particularly focusing on data sparsity and noise.

Method: The framework includes (1) an LLM-based generator to synthesize interactions for rare items to combat data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator to filter out noisy data (from real and synthetic datasets), with the refined data used to train I2I models.

Result: LLM-I2I improves recommendation accuracy, especially for long-tail items, and shows measurable performance improvements such as boosting recall number and gross merchandise value on a real-world e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: LLM-I2I demonstrates the potential of using Large Language Models to enhance data-centric recommendation systems without needing architectural changes to existing I2I models.

Abstract: Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation models are widely used in real-world systems due to their scalability, real-time capabilities, and high recommendation quality. Research to enhance I2I performance focuses on two directions: 1) model-centric approaches, which adopt deeper architectures but risk increased computational costs and deployment complexity, and 2) data-centric methods, which refine training data without altering models, offering cost-effectiveness but struggling with data sparsity and noise. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate data quality issues. LLM-I2I includes (1) an LLM-based generator that synthesizes user-item interactions for long-tail items, alleviating data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator that filters noisy interactions from real and synthetic data. The refined data is then fused to train I2I models. Evaluated on industry (AEDS) and academic (ARD) datasets, LLM-I2I consistently improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for long-tail items. Deployed on a large-scale cross-border e-commerce platform, it boosts recall number (RN) by 6.02% and gross merchandise value (GMV) by 1.22% over existing I2I models. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing data-centric recommendation systems without modifying model architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat driver drowsiness, a leading cause of traffic accidents, by developing a precise and stable real-time detection system.

Method: Proposes a Modified TSception architecture with a five-layer temporal refinement, Adaptive Average Pooling, and a two-stage fusion mechanism for enhanced performance.

Result: Achieves 83.46% accuracy on SEED-VIG dataset with reduced confidence interval, and state-of-the-art accuracy on STEW dataset for mental workload classification.

Conclusion: The Modified TSception model demonstrates enhanced stability, accuracy, and cross-task generalizability for EEG-based drowsiness and mental workload assessment.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a primary cause of traffic accidents, necessitating the development of real-time, reliable detection systems to ensure road safety. This study presents a Modified TSception architecture designed for the robust assessment of driver fatigue using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a novel hierarchical architecture that surpasses the original TSception by implementing a five-layer temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics. A key innovation is the use of Adaptive Average Pooling, which provides the structural flexibility to handle varying EEG input dimensions, and a two - stage fusion mechanism that optimizes the integration of spatiotemporal features for improved stability. When evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset and compared against established methods - including SVM, Transformer, EEGNet, ConvNeXt, LMDA-Net, and the original TSception - the Modified TSception achieves a comparable accuracy of 83.46% (vs. 83.15% for the original). Critically, the proposed model exhibits a substantially reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), signifying a marked improvement in performance stability. Furthermore, the architecture's generalizability is validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results with 95.93% and 95.35% accuracy for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These improvements in consistency and cross-task generalizability underscore the effectiveness of the proposed modifications for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify VR content creation for non-experts by replacing complex modeling tools with intuitive and playful methods.

Method: The framework translates air-drawn sketches into structure and arrangement of objects, while gestures add dynamic physical behavior, like motion and force.

Result: SketchPlay allows non-expert users to intuitively create physically realistic phenomena and shows significant improvements in expressiveness and user experience over traditional methods.

Conclusion: SketchPlay reduces the barriers for VR content creation, showcasing potential in education, art, and storytelling applications.

Abstract: Creating physically realistic content in VR often requires complex modeling tools or predefined 3D models, textures, and animations, which present significant barriers for non-expert users. In this paper, we propose SketchPlay, a novel VR interaction framework that transforms humans' air-drawn sketches and gestures into dynamic, physically realistic scenes, making content creation intuitive and playful like drawing. Specifically, sketches capture the structure and spatial arrangement of objects and scenes, while gestures convey physical cues such as velocity, direction, and force that define movement and behavior. By combining these complementary forms of input, SketchPlay captures both the structure and dynamics of user-created content, enabling the generation of a wide range of complex physical phenomena, such as rigid body motion, elastic deformation, and cloth dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional text-driven methods, SketchPlay offers significant advantages in expressiveness, and user experience. By providing an intuitive and engaging creation process, SketchPlay lowers the entry barrier for non-expert users and shows strong potential for applications in education, art, and immersive storytelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CMR imaging is limited by slow scan times and inconsistencies across medical environments, highlighting the need for a generalist model for ultra-fast CMR imaging that can adapt universally.

Method: The researchers created MMCMR-427K, a comprehensive multi-coil k-space database, and developed CardioMM, a reconstruction model that combines semantic understanding with physics-informed data consistency to adapt dynamically to varied imaging conditions.

Result: CardioMM achieved state-of-the-art performance in internal studies and generalized effectively to external settings, maintaining reliable cardiac phenotype and diagnostic image quality even at high imaging acceleration.

Conclusion: The MMCMR-427K database and CardioMM model pave the way for scalable, high-quality, and efficient cardiovascular imaging accessible for clinical use.

Abstract: Multimodal cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides comprehensive and non-invasive insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis and underlying mechanisms. Despite decades of advancements, its widespread clinical adoption remains constrained by prolonged scan times and heterogeneity across medical environments. This underscores the urgent need for a generalist reconstruction foundation model for ultra-fast CMR imaging, one capable of adapting across diverse imaging scenarios and serving as the essential substrate for all downstream analyses. To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents. Building on this unprecedented resource, we introduce CardioMM, a generalist reconstruction foundation model capable of dynamically adapting to heterogeneous fast CMR imaging scenarios. CardioMM unifies semantic contextual understanding with physics-informed data consistency to deliver robust reconstructions across varied scanners, protocols, and patient presentations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that CardioMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the internal centers and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen external settings. Even at imaging acceleration up to 24x, CardioMM reliably preserves key cardiac phenotypes, quantitative myocardial biomarkers, and diagnostic image quality, enabling a substantial increase in CMR examination throughput without compromising clinical integrity. Together, our open-access MMCMR-427K database and CardioMM framework establish a scalable pathway toward high-throughput, high-quality, and clinically accessible cardiovascular imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency of gastrointestinal disease diagnosis from endoscopic and histopathological images.

Method: A teacher-student framework integrating Swin Transformer and Vision Transformer for feature extraction, with a compact Tiny-ViT student model inheriting knowledge through soft-label distillation.

Result: The framework achieved 99.78% and 99.28% accuracy on two datasets with an AUC of 1.0000, demonstrating high discriminatory power.

Conclusion: This framework is effective, interpretable, and scalable, offering efficient diagnostic performance for resource-constrained clinical use.

Abstract: The accurate classification of gastrointestinal diseases from endoscopic and histopathological imagery remains a significant challenge in medical diagnostics, mainly due to the vast data volume and subtle variation in inter-class visuals. This study presents a hybrid dual-stream deep learning framework built on teacher-student knowledge distillation, where a high-capacity teacher model integrates the global contextual reasoning of a Swin Transformer with the local fine-grained feature extraction of a Vision Transformer. The student network was implemented as a compact Tiny-ViT structure that inherits the teacher's semantic and morphological knowledge via soft-label distillation, achieving a balance between efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Two carefully curated Wireless Capsule Endoscopy datasets, encompassing major GI disease classes, were employed to ensure balanced representation and prevent inter-sample bias. The proposed framework achieved remarkable performance with accuracies of 0.9978 and 0.9928 on Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 respectively, and an average AUC of 1.0000, signifying near-perfect discriminative capability. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM, LIME, and Score-CAM confirmed that the model's predictions were grounded in clinically significant tissue regions and pathologically relevant morphological cues, validating the framework's transparency and reliability. The Tiny-ViT demonstrated diagnostic performance with reduced computational complexity comparable to its transformer-based teacher while delivering faster inference, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Overall, the proposed framework provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for AI-assisted GI disease diagnosis, paving the way toward future intelligent endoscopic screening that is compatible with clinical practicality.

Result: RT-Focuser achieves high performance with a PSNR of 30.67 dB, only 5.85M parameters, and 15.76 GMACs. It processes frames at 6ms on GPU and mobile devices, achieving over 140 FPS.

Conclusion: RT-Focuser is effective and efficient for real-time deblurring, suitable for edge devices and practical deployment in various applications.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera or object movement severely degrades image quality and poses challenges for real-time applications such as autonomous driving, UAV perception, and medical imaging. In this paper, a lightweight U-shaped network tailored for real-time deblurring is presented and named RT-Focuser. To balance speed and accuracy, we design three key components: Lightweight Deblurring Block (LD) for edge-aware feature extraction, Multi-Level Integrated Aggregation module (MLIA) for encoder integration, and Cross-source Fusion Block (X-Fuse) for progressive decoder refinement. Trained on a single blurred input, RT-Focuser achieves 30.67 dB PSNR with only 5.85M parameters and 15.76 GMACs. It runs 6ms per frame on GPU and mobile, exceeds 140 FPS on both, showing strong potential for deployment on the edge.

### [265] [The Color-Clinical Decoupling: Why Perceptual Calibration Fails Clinical Biomarkers in Smartphone Dermatology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21988)
*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology fails to ensure reliable clinical biomarkers for underrepresented skin phototypes despite colorimetric calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test reliability of colorimetric calibration for clinical biomarkers, especially for underrepresented skin phototypes.

Method: Analyzed 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects using diverse devices, testing calibration's impact on clinical biomarkers.

Result: While calibration improved perceptual color accuracy, it failed to ensure reliable biomarker extraction due to anatomical and formula-induced variances.

Conclusion: Current colorimetric standards are insufficient; region-aware protocols are needed for effective mobile dermatology.

Abstract: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E < 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.
  We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.

### [266] [Near-Optimal Coalition Structures in Polynomial Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21657)
*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper compares three approaches for the coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and demonstrates that sparse relaxation methods outperform dynamic programming (DP) and MILP algorithms in computational efficiency under a specific model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate and improve the computational efficiency of methods in solving the CSG problem for achieving near-optimal results.

Method: The authors analyze dynamic programming (DP), MILP branch-and-bound methods, and sparse relaxations using a random 'sparse synergy' model and probabilistic approach.

Result: Sparse relaxation methods are shown to recover near-optimal welfare in polynomial time with high probability, while DP and MILP require exponential time for comparable quality.

Conclusion: Sparse relaxations provide a significant computational advantage in the CSG problem, offering a faster alternative while still achieving near-optimal results.

Abstract: We study the classical coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and compare the anytime behavior of three algorithmic paradigms: dynamic programming (DP), MILP branch-and-bound, and sparse relaxations based on greedy or $l_1$-type methods. Under a simple random "sparse synergy" model for coalition values, we prove that sparse relaxations recover coalition structures whose welfare is arbitrarily close to optimal in polynomial time with high probability. In contrast, broad classes of DP and MILP algorithms require exponential time before attaining comparable solution quality. This establishes a rigorous probabilistic anytime separation in favor of sparse relaxations, even though exact methods remain ultimately optimal.

*Qiushi Han,David Simchi-Levi,Renfei Tan,Zishuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The study introduces a Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM) integrating mechanism design and online learning to achieve truthful reporting and cost-optimality in sequential games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design mechanisms that elicit truthful reports from rational agents in sequential decision-making settings without prior knowledge of agents' beliefs.

Method: The DRAM framework estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to balance payments and truthfulness.

Result: DRAM guarantees truthful reporting with high probability and achieves $tO(sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, with a matching lower bound showing its optimality.

Conclusion: DRAM is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that ensures truthfulness and optimal regret, offering a pioneering solution to incentive constraint learning.

Abstract: We study a sequential mechanism design problem in which a principal seeks to elicit truthful reports from multiple rational agents while starting with no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned.

### [268] [Semantic Codebooks as Effective Priors for Neural Speech Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21653)
*Liuyang Bai,Weiyi Lu,Li Guo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SemDAC introduces a semantic-aware neural audio codec that uses semantic codebooks from HuBERT features for improved speech compression, outperforming traditional DAC codecs in perceptual and recognition metrics at lower bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech codecs optimize waveform fidelity but result in inefficient compression and suboptimal recognition task performance. A better approach is needed to enhance compression efficiency while maintaining recognition performance.

Method: SemDAC employs residual vector quantization, where the first quantizer derives semantic tokens from HuBERT features to capture phonetic content. Subsequent quantizers model residual acoustics, and a FiLM-conditioned decoder reconstructs speech based on semantic tokens.

Result: SemDAC surpasses DAC in perceptual metrics and produces lower WER in recognition tasks using Whisper, while operating at significantly lower bitrates (e.g., 0.95 kbps vs. 2.5 kbps).

Conclusion: Semantic codebooks from HuBERT features effectively enable efficient neural speech compression, resulting in compact, recognition-friendly audio representations.

Abstract: Speech codecs are traditionally optimized for waveform fidelity, allocating bits to preserve acoustic detail even when much of it can be inferred from linguistic structure. This leads to inefficient compression and suboptimal performance on downstream recognition tasks. We propose SemDAC, a semantic-aware neural audio codec that leverages semantic codebooks as effective priors for speech compression. In SemDAC, the first quantizer in a residual vector quantization (RVQ) stack is distilled from HuBERT features to produce semantic tokens that capture phonetic content, while subsequent quantizers model residual acoustics. A FiLM-conditioned decoder reconstructs audio conditioned on the semantic tokens, improving efficiency in the use of acoustic codebooks. Despite its simplicity, this design proves highly effective: SemDAC outperforms DAC across perceptual metrics and achieves lower WER when running Whisper on reconstructed speech, all while operating at substantially lower bitrates (e.g., 0.95 kbps vs. 2.5 kbps for DAC). These results demonstrate that semantic codebooks provide an effective inductive bias for neural speech compression, producing compact yet recognition-friendly representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on Bengali deepfake audio detection in light of growing security concerns caused by advancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion.

Method: The study analyzes both zero-shot and fine-tuned model approaches for Bengali deepfake detection. Models like Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 and fine-tuned architectures such as ResNet18 and LCNN are evaluated for performance.

Result: Zero-shot models showed limited accuracy, with Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 achieving 53.80% accuracy. Fine-tuned models significantly improved performance, with ResNet18 achieving 79.17% accuracy, an F1 score of 79.12%, and an AUC of 84.37%.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned deep learning models offer better detection capabilities for Bengali deepfake audio than zero-shot methods, emphasizing their effectiveness for this low-resource language task.

Abstract: The rapid growth of speech synthesis and voice conversion systems has made deepfake audio a major security concern. Bengali deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study automatic detection of Bengali audio deepfakes using the BanglaFake dataset. We evaluate zeroshot inference with several pretrained models. These include Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, Whisper, PANNsCNN14, WavLM and Audio Spectrogram Transformer. Zero-shot results show limited detection ability. The best model, Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, achieves 53.80% accuracy, 56.60% AUC and 46.20% EER. We then f ine-tune multiple architectures for Bengali deepfake detection. These include Wav2Vec2-Base, LCNN, LCNN-Attention, ResNet18, ViT-B16 and CNN-BiLSTM. Fine-tuned models show strong performance gains. ResNet18 achieves the highest accuracy of 79.17%, F1 score of 79.12%, AUC of 84.37% and EER of 24.35%. Experimental results confirm that fine-tuning significantly improves performance over zero-shot inference. This study provides the first systematic benchmark of Bengali deepfake audio detection. It highlights the effectiveness of f ine-tuned deep learning models for this low-resource language.

### [270] [Learning to Reconfigure: Using Device Status to Select the Right Constrained Coding Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21396)
*Doğukan Özbayrak,Ahmed Hareedy*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper presents reconfigurable coding schemes and proposes offline and online learning methods for optimizing coding transitions in TDMR technology to enhance device lifespan and storage capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work arises from the need for reconfigurable coding schemes that adapt to the varying protection requirements of modern storage systems as devices age, aiming to extend their lifespan.

Method: The paper introduces offline and online learning methods to train polynomial equations predicting device error rates. These equations guide optimal reconfiguration of coding schemes through linear programming optimization.

Result: The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves global optimal reconfiguration solutions and provide experiments showing improvements in TDMR system performance regarding storage capacity and decoding complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance the functionality of TDMR systems by maximizing storage capacity, minimizing decoding complexity, and supporting optimal reconfiguration decisions.

Abstract: In the age of data revolution, a modern storage~or transmission system typically requires different levels of protection. For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.

### [271] [LEFT-RS: A Lock-Free Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing Protocol for Multicore Real-Time Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21701)
*Nan Chen,Xiaotian Dai,Tong Cheng,Alan Burns,Iain Bate,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper introduces LEFT-RS, a new protocol for multicore real-time systems ensuring efficient, fault-tolerant resource sharing without traditional locking constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional locking protocols in managing transient faults during critical sections in multicore real-time systems.

Method: The authors propose the LEFT-RS protocol, enabling concurrent access to resources and fault-tolerant resource management for tasks in parallel execution.

Result: LEFT-RS improves schedulability by up to 84.5% and ensures timing guarantees with enhanced fault resilience and reduced overhead.

Conclusion: LEFT-RS is a promising solution for multicore real-time systems, addressing transient faults effectively and enhancing resource-sharing efficiency.

Abstract: Emerging real-time applications have driven the transition to multicore embedded systems, where tasks must share resources due to functional demands and limited availability. These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average.

*Sean Plummer*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper links Singular Learning Theory with statistical mechanics, interpreting 'singular fluctuation' as specific heat and introducing diagnostic thermodynamic quantities to analyze singular posterior structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify the statistical meaning of the 'singular fluctuation' in Singular Learning Theory and explore its properties and implications in Bayesian models.

Method: The authors frame singular fluctuation as specific heat and derive relationships to various thermodynamic quantities. They conduct numerical experiments on different singular model types to validate theoretical insights.

Result: The study demonstrates that thermodynamic diagnostics distinguish singularity types, show stable finite-sample behaviors, and identify phenomena like phase transitions. It also connects WAIC with specific heat, making it robust in singular models.

Conclusion: The paper bridges Singular Learning Theory and statistical mechanics, emphasizing its theoretical relevance and providing tools for geometrical and practical diagnostics of Bayesian models.

Abstract: Singular learning theory (SLT) \citep{watanabe2009algebraic,watanabe2018mathematical} provides a rigorous asymptotic framework for Bayesian models with non-identifiable parameterizations, yet the statistical meaning of its second-order invariant, the \emph{singular fluctuation}, has remained unclear. In this work, we show that singular fluctuation admits a precise and natural interpretation as a \emph{specific heat}: the second derivative of the Bayesian free energy with respect to temperature. Equivalently, it measures the posterior variance of the log-likelihood observable under the tempered Gibbs posterior. We further introduce a collection of related thermodynamic quantities, including entropy flow, prior susceptibility, and cross-susceptibility, that together provide a detailed geometric diagnosis of singular posterior structure. Through extensive numerical experiments spanning discrete symmetries, boundary singularities, continuous gauge freedoms, and piecewise (ReLU) models, we demonstrate that these thermodynamic signatures cleanly distinguish singularity types, exhibit stable finite-sample behavior, and reveal phase-transition--like phenomena as temperature varies. We also show empirically that the widely used WAIC estimator \citep{watanabe2010asymptotic, watanabe2013widely} is exactly twice the thermodynamic specific heat at unit temperature, clarifying its robustness in singular models.Our results establish a concrete bridge between singular learning theory and statistical mechanics, providing both theoretical insight and practical diagnostics for modern Bayesian models.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper explores SAGIN-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) and its challenges in utilizing TN and NTN networks. AI-driven resource allocation methods are proposed as effective solutions to address these complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of resource allocation in heterogeneous Space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGIN) to facilitate next-gen multiconnectivity with enhanced performance.

Method: The paper analyzes current SAGIN-enabled MC developments, showcases AI-driven resource optimization via agentic reinforcement learning (RL), and conducts a case study to evaluate performance.

Result: AI-driven methods significantly improve network latency and capacity in heterogeneous SAGIN environments, with a minor tradeoff in power consumption.

Conclusion: AI-based methods effectively optimize resource allocation in SAGIN-enabled MC, though further research is needed to address emerging challenges and improve efficiency.

Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.

*Michail Kalntis,George Iosifidis,José Suárez-Varela,Andra Lutu,Fernando A. Kuipers*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional and conditional handovers in mobile networks by introducing CONTRA, a jointly optimized framework for handover types within the O-RAN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and conditional handovers face limitations in signaling, resource usage, and reliability, particularly in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. These challenges motivate the need for adaptive and robust handover control in next-generation networks.

Method: The study proposes CONTRA, a framework to optimize both traditional and conditional handovers. The framework includes a meta-learning algorithm for dynamic adaptation and implementation within the O-RAN xApp structure for near-real-time decision-making.

Result: CONTRA demonstrates superior performance, improving user throughput and reducing switching costs, outperforming existing 3GPP and reinforcement learning baselines in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CONTRA is an innovative, real-time adaptable solution for handover management, aligning with 6G goals of intelligent and flexible network control, proving its effectiveness via extensive evaluations.

Abstract: While traditional handovers (THOs) have served as a backbone for mobile connectivity, they increasingly suffer from failures and delays, especially in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper combines molecular dynamics simulations and a convolutional neural network to accurately predict temperature during aluminum friction stir welding using spatially resolved atomistic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve accurate temperature predictions during aluminum friction stir welding, which is critical for understanding thermomechanical behavior and heat generation processes.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS modeled atomic-scale processes during friction stir welding, with atomistic data transformed into 2D physics-based spatial grids. A 2D convolutional neural network was optimized for temperature prediction based on this data.

Result: The model achieved strong predictive performance with R² = 0.9439, RMSE = 14.94 K, and MAE = 11.58 K on unseen data, showing accuracy and consistency with physical deformation and heat generation mechanisms.

Conclusion: Spatial learning from atomistic simulation data effectively predicts temperature and aligns with observed physical phenomena in friction stir welding, providing a new pathway for analyzing complicated thermomechanical processes.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of temperature evolution is essential for understanding thermomechanical behavior in friction stir welding. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale.

*Brani Vidakovic*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces two quantum formulations of the nondecimated wavelet transform (NDWT), enhancing multiscale quantum signal processing with features like redundancy and shift invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To embed classical properties like stability, redundancy, and shift invariance of NDWT into the domain of quantum computation for advanced signal analysis.

Method: The first method leverages quantum-controlled circular shifts and wavelet analysis, while the second employs the Hadamard test with diagonal phase operators for scale-shift wavelet analysis.

Result: The paper provides unitary quantum representations of redundant wavelet coefficients and access to shift-invariant spectra. Practical applications include denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling.

Conclusion: Quantum NDWTs exploit redundancy and shift invariance effectively in quantum settings, offering a robust framework for multiscale quantum signal processing.

Abstract: The nondecimated or translation-invariant wavelet transform (NDWT) is a central tool in classical multiscale signal analysis, valued for its stability, redundancy, and shift invariance. This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing.

TL;DR: The paper presents EcoNet, a Bayesian framework for intelligent energy management in households and neighborhoods, addressing uncertainties and conflicting goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize household energy management, balancing conflicting goals such as energy cost reduction, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, and maintaining comfort under uncertain conditions.

Method: A Bayesian active inference approach is used to develop EcoNet for household and neighborhood energy management under uncertain forecasts and complex preferences.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of EcoNet in improving energy management while addressing uncertainties and balancing conflicting goals.

Conclusion: EcoNet shows promise in accommodating uncertainties and conflicting preferences in household and neighborhood energy management.

Abstract: Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences. Simulation results are presented and discussed.

*Brian Knaeble,Qinyun Lin,Erich Kummerfeld,Kenneth A. Frank*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for sensitivity analysis addressing confounding by hidden treatment versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve causal inference by addressing the gap in existing sensitivity analysis methods that primarily focus on covariates, rather than hidden versions of treatment.

Method: The paper develops new mathematical notation and proposes a novel sensitivity analysis methodology for identifying confounding by hidden treatment versions.

Result: The paper demonstrates the method through example applications, emphasizing its utility in distinguishing covariates from versions of treatment.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances existing frameworks for sensitivity analysis by specifically targeting hidden treatment versions, thus improving causal inference in scenarios like interventions and surgery.

Abstract: Sensitivity analysis informs causal inference by assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to departures from assumptions. The consistency assumption states that there are no hidden versions of treatment and that the outcome arising naturally equals the outcome arising from intervention. When reasoning about the possibility of consistency violations, it can be helpful to distinguish between covariates and versions of treatment. In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis. Whereas many methods for sensitivity analysis are focused on confounding by unmeasured covariates, the methodology of this paper is focused on confounding by hidden versions of treatment. In this paper, new mathematical notation is introduced to support the novel method, and example applications are described.

### [279] [Modeling high dimensional point clouds with the spherical cluster model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21960)
*Frédéric Cazals,Antoine Commaret,Louis Goldenberg*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces the spherical cluster model (SC) to represent clusters with spheres, discusses its optimization problem, and evaluates its performance with an exact solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address geometric clustering in high-dimensional spaces by proposing a parametric model with better computational efficiency and representational accuracy.

Method: The paper defines the SC model using a sphere's center and radius; formulates the optimization problem as minimizing cost; develops an exact solver leveraging the Clarke gradient within a stratified cell complex.

Result: Results demonstrate the exact algorithm is significantly faster than heuristics for datasets in diverse dimensions, and the SC model's center functions as a high-dimensional median.

Conclusion: The SC model is suitable for high-dimensional data analysis and offers potential for future applications, such as mixture models.

Abstract: A parametric cluster model is a statistical model providing geometric insights onto the points defining a cluster. The {\em spherical cluster model} (SC) approximates a finite point set $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ by a sphere $S(c,r)$ as follows. Taking $r$ as a fraction $η\in(0,1)$ (hyper-parameter) of the std deviation of distances between the center $c$ and the data points, the cost of the SC model is the sum over all data points lying outside the sphere $S$ of their power distance with respect to $S$. The center $c$ of the SC model is the point minimizing this cost. Note that $η=0$ yields the celebrated center of mass used in KMeans clustering. We make three contributions.
  First, we show fitting a spherical cluster yields a strictly convex but not smooth combinatorial optimization problem. Second, we present an exact solver using the Clarke gradient on a suitable stratified cell complex defined from an arrangement of hyper-spheres. Finally, we present experiments on a variety of datasets ranging in dimension from $d=9$ to $d=10,000$, with two main observations. First, the exact algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than BFGS based heuristics for datasets of small/intermediate dimension and small values of $η$, and for high dimensional datasets (say $d>100$) whatever the value of $η$. Second, the center of the SC model behave as a parameterized high-dimensional median.
  The SC model is of direct interest for high dimensional multivariate data analysis, and the application to the design of mixtures of SC will be reported in a companion paper.

### [280] [Query Carefully: Detecting the Unanswerables in Text-to-SQL Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21345)
*Jasmin Saxer,Isabella Maria Aigner,Luise Linzmeier,Andreas Weiler,Kurt Stockinger*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of risks in text-to-SQL systems in biomedical fields and introduces 'Query Carefully,' a pipeline for SQL generation with unanswerable query detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical applications require precise and accurate handling of textual database queries, which standard text-to-SQL systems risk producing inaccurately or ambiguously.

Method: The authors developed a pipeline combining LLM-based SQL generation (using llama3.3:70b) with schema-aware prompts, explicit avoidance rules, few-shot learning, and specialized datasets.

Result: Balanced prompting improves unanswerable query detection accuracy (0.8). Precision was high for certain query types (e.g., non-SQL categories) but lower for ambiguous cases (e.g., missing values).

Conclusion: 'Query Carefully' supports safer text-to-SQL execution by increasing transparency and reliability in biomedical database querying with methods to handle ambiguous queries effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems allow non-SQL experts to interact with relational databases using natural language. However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3). A lightweight user interface surfaces interim SQL, execution results, and abstentions, supporting transparent and reliable text-to-SQL in biomedical applications.

### [281] [Applications of synthetic financial data in portfolio and risk modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21798)
*Christophe D. Hounwanou,Yae Ulrich Gaba*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative models, such as TimeGAN and VAEs, to create synthetic financial data that replicates real-world characteristics for quantitative financial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and accessibility challenges in financial research by using synthetic financial data.

Method: Evaluates generative models (TimeGAN and VAEs) using historical S&P 500 returns with metrics such as statistical similarity, temporal structure, and financial task analysis.

Result: TimeGAN effectively replicates real financial data characteristics, enabling realistic portfolio analysis. VAEs perform stably but smooth extreme events, impacting risk estimation.

Conclusion: Synthetic financial datasets can substitute real data for privacy-preserving and cost-effective financial experimentation, especially when temporal dynamics are well captured.

Abstract: Synthetic financial data offers a practical way to address the privacy and accessibility challenges that limit research in quantitative finance. This paper examines the use of generative models, in particular TimeGAN and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for creating synthetic return series that support portfolio construction, trading analysis, and risk modeling. Using historical daily returns from the S and P 500 as a benchmark, we generate synthetic datasets under comparable market conditions and evaluate them using statistical similarity metrics, temporal structure tests, and downstream financial tasks. The study shows that TimeGAN produces synthetic data with distributional shapes, volatility patterns, and autocorrelation behaviour that are close to those observed in real returns. When applied to mean-variance portfolio optimization, the resulting synthetic datasets lead to portfolio weights, Sharpe ratios, and risk levels that remain close to those obtained from real data. The VAE provides more stable training but tends to smooth extreme market movements, which affects risk estimation. Finally, the analysis supports the use of synthetic datasets as substitutes for real financial data in portfolio analysis and risk simulation, particularly when models are able to capture temporal dynamics. Synthetic data therefore provides a privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for financial experimentation and model development.

### [282] [Incorporating rank-free coupling and external field via an amplitude-only modulated spatial photonic Ising machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21587)
*Ze Zheng,Yuegang Li,Hang Xu,Jingzheng Huang,Tailong Xiao,Guihua Zeng*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) that optimizes scalability, precision, and speed in solving Ising model problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current laser diffraction-based spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) which compromise time efficiency or spin count for encoding complex Ising Hamiltonians, limiting their scalability for real-world applications.

Method: The authors reformulate the Ising Hamiltonian using Hadamard products and implement it through aligned amplitude spatial light modulators and digital micro-mirrors to directly map Ising models into incoherent light fields without auxiliary operations.

Result: The AR-SPIM exhibited a high linear coefficient of determination (>0.9800) and Pearson correlation coefficient (>0.9997) between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians. It achieves a low error rate (<0.3%) for Max-Cut problem solutions and supports observations of complex phase transitions while enabling scalability for large spin counts.

Conclusion: The AR-SPIM demonstrates significant improvement in encoding arbitrary Ising models with high precision and speed. Its scalability and reconfigurability make it promising for applications in machine learning, discrete optimization, and quantum simulations.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.

*Hua Shen*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the concept of human-AI synergy in education, stressing mutual adaptation for equity, trust, and human flourishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the transformative potential of AI in education while mitigating risks like equity, privacy, and autonomy.

Method: Emphasis on bidirectional human-AI alignment and analysis of emerging research and case studies in education.

Result: Identified AI's potential role evolution and its influence on roles/governance, proposing actionable strategies.

Conclusion: A future vision presented where humans and AI collaborate to enhance learning, equity, and overall flourishing.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, offering unprecedented opportunities to personalize learning, enhance assessment, and support educators. Yet these opportunities also introduce risks related to equity, privacy, and student autonomy. This chapter develops the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment in education, emphasizing that trustworthy learning environments arise not only from embedding human values into AI systems but also from equipping teachers, students, and institutions with the skills to interpret, critique, and guide these technologies. Drawing on emerging research and practical case examples, we explore AI's evolution from support tool to collaborative partner, highlighting its impacts on teacher roles, student agency, and institutional governance. We propose actionable strategies for policymakers, developers, and educators to ensure that AI advances equity, transparency, and human flourishing rather than eroding them. By reframing AI adoption as an ongoing process of mutual adaptation, the chapter envisions a future in which humans and intelligent systems learn, innovate, and grow together.
