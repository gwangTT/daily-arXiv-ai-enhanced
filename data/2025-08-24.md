### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reasoning architecture using Graph Signal Processing (GSP) to fully integrate symbolic logic with neural inference, improving consistency, interpretability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in conventional reasoning models that use spectral graph methods only as auxiliary elements, by fully leveraging GSP for robust neuro-symbolic reasoning systems.

Method: The authors encode logical entities and relationships as graph signals, process them through learnable spectral filters, and map them into symbolic predicates for inference. They propose a mathematical framework involving graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding.

Result: The proposed architecture shows enhanced logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency across benchmark reasoning datasets such as ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge.

Conclusion: Graph Signal Processing serves as a solid mathematical foundation and efficient computational approach for constructing interpretable and reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning systems.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel computational framework where the descriptive (state representation) and prescriptive (reward function) aspects of purposeful behavior co-emerge from the experiences of cognitive agents, inspired by concepts in Buddhist epistemology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of traditional reinforcement learning models that separate state representation and reward function by proposing an alternative where these aspects co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.

Method: The framework introduces 'telic states,' which are defined using statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. This idea is rooted in agent-environment interaction sequences and draws on Buddhist epistemology for inspiration.

Result: The paper offers a comprehensive review of empirical and theoretical literature to substantiate this framework and discusses its potential for unifying neural, phenomenological, and behavioral aspects of purposeful behavior.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel perspective of goal-directed learning that could integrate various dimensions of intelligence, potentially enhancing our understanding of purposeful behavior across natural and artificial agents.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang WÃ¶rndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collab-REC, a collaborative multi-agent model using LLMs to tackle popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in recommender systems, especially popularity bias and inadequate diversity, which lead to over-tourism and disregard for user constraints.

Method: Three LLM-based agents (Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability) generate city suggestions. A non-LLM moderator facilitates multi-round negotiation to refine and balance these suggestions.

Result: Experiments on European city queries demonstrated improved diversity, relevance, and promotion of lesser-known destinations compared to single-agent approaches.

Conclusion: Collab-REC fosters a balanced, context-aware recommendation approach, showcasing the value of multi-stakeholder collaboration to mitigate over-tourism and align with user constraints.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using large language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd simulations by incorporating inter-agent dialogue and language-driven navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd simulation techniques neglect the role of language and dialogue, leading to limited interactions and less realistic global behaviors.

Method: The authors use LLMs to control agents' movements via a dialogue system, considering personalities, roles, and relationships of agents, alongside their sensory inputs and physical states.

Result: The approach generates more realistic simulations with emergent group behaviors and automatic grouping/ungrouping of agents.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into crowd simulation improves realism by combining spatial, social, and dialogue-driven interactions.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [5] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates calibration challenges in reasoning LLMs, finding that increased reasoning budgets can worsen confidence accuracy, while search-augmented generation significantly improves calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address overconfidence issues in large language models (LLMs) when used for question answering tasks, which require better calibration to ensure reliable predictions.

Method: The authors evaluate LLMs using the ClimateX dataset, expanding it to include human and planetary health, and analyze the effects of reasoning budgets and search-augmented generation on confidence assessment.

Result: LLMs with extended reasoning exhibit worse calibration due to overconfidence. Introducing search-augmented generation achieves improved accuracy of 89.3%, outperforming increased reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Access to relevant information through search-based methods is more critical than extended reasoning for accurate confidence calibration in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [6] [Demonstrating Onboard Inference for Earth Science Applications with Spectral Analysis Algorithms and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15053)
*Itai Zilberstein,Alberto Candela,Steve Chien,David Rijlaarsdam,Tom Hendrix,Leonie Buckley,Aubrey Dunne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses CS-6, a satellite capable of hyperspectral analysis and onboard data processing using neural networks for Earth science applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable novel Earth science measurements and responses by performing advanced data analysis onboard satellites.

Method: The satellite CS-6 is equipped with a hyperspectral instrument and neural network acceleration hardware to perform onboard data analysis using deep learning and spectral analysis.

Result: The demonstration of onboard analysis extends possibilities of real-time Earth science applications using CS-6 hardware and algorithms.

Conclusion: CS-6 showcases breakthroughs in Earth science by integrating deep learning with onboard acceleration for hyperspectral data processing.

Abstract: In partnership with Ubotica Technologies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
demonstrating state-of-the-art data analysis onboard CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6).
CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for
numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [7] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes S3LoRA, a framework to mitigate safety risks in fine-tuned models by analyzing and selectively pruning weight updates without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA are useful for adapting LLMs but can compromise safety alignment, leading to unstable behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce MAS-SVD to analyze structural properties of LoRA updates and the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI) metric to identify unsafe layers for post-hoc pruning.

Result: S3LoRA enhances safety metrics while maintaining or improving task performance across various tasks, and reduces inference costs.

Conclusion: S3LoRA provides a practical, scalable, and data-free solution for deploying LLM agents safely in constrained and critical environments.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

### [8] [Argumentation for Explainable Workforce Optimisation (with Appendix)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15118)
*Jennifer Leigh,Dimitrios Letsios,Alessandro Mella,Lucio Machetti,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses workforce management challenges, proposing abstract argumentation to handle changes effectively and improve explanation for stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce management requires optimized scheduling and clear stakeholder explanations, especially during unexpected changes during execution.

Method: Abstract argumentation methods were applied to workforce management to build tools that accommodate changes and provide faithful explanations.

Result: The study found that using the proposed tool led to faster and more accurate problem-solving compared to manual solutions.

Conclusion: Abstract argumentation enhances workforce management by providing adaptable and explainable tools, beneficial for both problem-solving and stakeholder communication.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

### [9] [Open-Universe Assistance Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119)
*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs) and a method GOOD for extracting human goals in Natural Language during interaction and inferring their representation, evaluated in grocery and robotics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable embodied AI agents to infer human goals and act interpretable across diverse and dynamically evolving settings.

Method: Developing GOOD, which uses an LLM to simulate user intents and perform probabilistic inference on natural language goals without requiring extensive datasets.

Result: GOOD performed better than a baseline in text-based grocery shopping and simulated robotics tasks, validated by both LLM and human evaluations.

Conclusion: GOOD is a promising step for goal extraction and uncertainty estimation in open-ended, dynamic domains for embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'aiXiv,' a platform that enables collaboration between human and AI scientists to submit, review, and refine research papers, addressing the lack of dissemination venues for AI-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for a system to disseminate high-quality AI-generated research content as traditional and existing platforms often lack scalability or quality control mechanisms.

Method: aiXiv employs a multi-agent architecture, integrating both human and AI scientists for submitting, reviewing, and refining research, alongside providing API and MCP interfaces for seamless ecosystem integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show that aiXiv improves the quality of AI-generated research through iterative revisions and reviews within the platform.

Conclusion: aiXiv paves the way for an innovative open-access platform, enhancing the publishing ecosystem for AI-generated research and advancing scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

*Jiabo Ye,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Zhaoqing Zhu,Ziwei Zheng,Feiyu Gao,Junjie Cao,Zhengxi Lu,Jitong Liao,Qi Zheng,Fei Huang,Jingren Zhou,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents GUI-Owl, a state-of-the-art GUI agent model, and Mobile-Agent-v3 framework, which set records in GUI benchmarks through innovations in environment infrastructure, foundational agent capabilities, and scalable reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance GUI agent performance for diverse tasks like grounding, decision-making, and planning across desktop and mobile environments, addressing the limitations in existing open-source models.

Method: The study introduces three key advancements: a large-scale virtual environment infrastructure for self-evolving data generation, diverse capabilities for foundational agent modules, and a scalable RL framework with TRPO optimization for real-world accuracy.

Result: GUI-Owl achieves notable results, such as 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld, while Mobile-Agent-v3 improves these to 73.3 and 37.7, respectively. The TRPO strategy further enhances RL performance with a score of 34.9 on OSWorld.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 set new benchmarks for open-source GUI frameworks, emphasizing innovations that support scalability, modularity, and real-world application. These contributions are available as open-source tools for further research.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

### [12] [PuzzleClone: An SMT-Powered Framework for Synthesizing Verifiable Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15180)
*Kai Xiong,Yanwei Huang,Rongjunchen Zhang,Kun Chen,Haipang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PuzzleClone, a framework for generating verifiable and scalable logical puzzles, improving reasoning capabilities of LLMs. It improves model performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-generated datasets suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability, which hinders enhancement in reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The approach encodes logical puzzles into structured specifications, generates scalable variations through randomization, and validates puzzles programmatically to ensure accuracy.

Result: Using PuzzleClone, over 83K diverse validated puzzles were created, and training on these datasets significantly improved model performance in reasoning tasks (e.g., PuzzleClone average score rising from 14.4 to 56.2).

Conclusion: PuzzleClone addresses reliability, diversity, and scalability concerns, providing a robust benchmark and demonstrably improving LLMs' reasoning efficacy across various benchmarks.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

*Wenjie Lin,Jin Wei-Kocsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4Sweat, a domain-specific open-source LLM framework tailored to support diagnosis and care for the rare condition hyperhidrosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by the scarcity of data in applying Large Language Models for rare diseases, using hyperhidrosis as a case study.

Method: The study follows a three-stage pipeline: (1) augmenting data with synthetic vignettes, (2) fine-tuning an open-source model to deliver medical and psychological insights, and (3) validating responses through expert review.

Result: LLM4Sweat demonstrates improved performance compared to baseline approaches, providing reliable and empathetic support tailored to hyperhidrosis care.

Conclusion: The framework offers potential not just for hyperhidrosis but as a generalizable method for other rare diseases facing data and trust challenges, marking a significant step in healthcare-focused AI development.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

Motivation: SSIs are prevalent, costly infections with limited resources for surgical wound care. Existing tools face challenges like privacy concerns, expensive annotations, and a lack of diverse datasets.

Method: The authors introduce SurgWound, an annotated dataset, and WoundQwen, a three-stage framework using Multi-Level Large Models (MLLMs) for wound diagnosis. This methodology includes prediction, diagnosis, and report generation stages.

Result: SurgWound provides 697 annotated surgical wound images, and WoundQwen successfully integrates wound characteristics, assessment of infection risk, and generates comprehensive reports for surgical wound care.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging AI tools with SurgWound and WoundQwen to enhance surgical wound diagnosis, paving the way for personalized patient care, timely interventions, and better clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

### [15] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-ConstraintBench to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP) and observes performance breakdowns as constraints increase, especially during interaction scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the reliability and limitations of LLMs in solving high-constraint reasoning tasks, which are critical for effective scheduling in sectors requiring resource and operational efficiency.

Method: R-ConstraintBench is used to incrementally test LLMs with increasing and interacting constraints, including downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints, within Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scenarios.

Result: LLMs perform well on simpler precedence-only DAGs but fail as constraints become more complex and interactive. The tests show that constraint interaction, not graph depth or simplicity, is the primary reason for failures.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with complex, interacting constraints, revealing their generalization limitations and highlighting areas for improving reasoning capabilities under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores sketch-to-diagram generation, introducing a training-free AI system that converts hand sketches into precise diagrams using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). It outperforms existing methods and produces editable SVG outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting rough hand sketches into precise diagrams is a challenging task unmet by traditional diffusion models, which lack the spatial and symbolic precision needed for compositional diagrams like flowcharts.

Method: The approach combines VLMs and LLMs in an iterative loop. It uses a Critic VLM to propose edits, multiple LLMs to generate diversity in updates, and a Judge VLM to select the best result. This design emphasizes qualitative reasoning, alignment, and human corrections.

Result: The system outperformed state-of-the-art closed-source models (like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) in reconstructing diagrams from sketches, achieving better layout and structural fidelity without introducing errors or unwanted artifacts.

Conclusion: The method addresses key limitations in diagram generation by merging vision and language reasoning, supports human interaction, and outputs editable SVGs that integrate smoothly into presentation workflows. This makes the approach extensible, customizable, and practically applicable.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes computational intelligence techniques for optimizing urban land-use allocation, achieving significant improvements in both compatibility and economic metrics through advanced algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for tools addressing trade-offs between land-use compatibility and economic goals in urban development.

Method: Development and application of custom optimization algorithms, such as CR+DES and MSBX+MO, with validation using statistical tests.

Result: CR+DES showed a 3.16% improvement in compatibility, while MSBX+MO provided a 3.3% economic optimization gain.

Conclusion: The algorithms support effective urban planning through improved trade-off management, offering valuable resources for rapidly growing cities.

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multiple memory system (MMS) to improve the quality of long-term memory processing in agents powered by large language models, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge faced by agents relying on large language models in effectively handling and utilizing historical interaction data, where existing memory modules have limitations in recall performance and quality.

Method: The proposed method is a multiple memory system inspired by cognitive psychology. It translates short-term memory into various long-term memory fragments and structures retrieval and contextual memory units, creating a one-to-one mapping for better recall during user queries.

Result: Experiments on the LoCoMo dataset demonstrated that MMS outperforms three existing methods. Ablation studies validated the importance of designed memory units and showed robustness in terms of memory segment selection and storage overhead.

Conclusion: MMS significantly enhances the quality and utility of memory in language model-powered agents, providing a practical solution for handling historical data effectively.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [19] [Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory for LLM Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15305)
*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory, for improving large language model agents' adaptability and planning capabilities by leveraging multi-granular memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents are limited by single-granularity memory derived from environmental interactions, which restricts their knowledge diversity and planning flexibility.

Method: They introduce a framework called Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory that collects coarse-grained experiences during training, refines them into actionable hybrid-grain tips, and uses these at inference to adapt to various scenarios.

Result: This framework enhances memory retrieval and task relevance, allowing LLM agents to effectively handle anomalies by grounding situations into fine-grained key information for self-questioning and plan adjustment.

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory significantly improves the planning versatility and adaptability of LLM-based agents for diverse and dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

### [20] [Search-Based Credit Assignment for Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15327)
*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to combine human feedback from demonstrations and preferences for offline reinforcement learning, addressing challenges in credit assignment and feedback limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline reinforcement learning methods often depend on hard-to-design reward functions. While human feedback offers an alternative, demonstrations and preferences each have limitations, necessitating a unified, efficient approach.

Method: The proposed Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) derives importance weights for trajectory segments using similarity scores between preference-labeled trajectories and expert demonstrations, enhancing preference learning accuracy.

Result: SPW achieves improved credit assignment and outperforms previous methods on complex robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Joint learning from preferences and demonstrations using the SPW framework is effective, addressing challenges in offline reinforcement learning with human feedback.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

*Bin Deng,Yizhe Feng,Zeming Liu,Qing Wei,Xiangrong Zhu,Shuai Chen,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies shortcomings in current automated travel planning systems and introduces the RETAIL dataset and TGMA framework to address implicit queries, environmental and preference awareness, and detailed POI integration, achieving improved performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in current automated travel planning systems, such as reliance on explicit user queries, lack of environmental and user preference considerations, and insufficient detail in plans.

Method: The authors construct a novel dataset called RETAIL that supports both explicit and implicit travel planning queries, incorporates environmental factors, and includes detailed POI data. Additionally, they propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework named TGMA.

Result: Experiments revealed that the best existing model achieves only a 1.0% pass rate, while the TGMA framework achieves a significantly improved performance of 2.72% in real-world travel planning.

Conclusion: The proposed RETAIL dataset and TGMA framework demonstrate potential for addressing the challenges of automated travel planning, providing a promising direction for future advancements in real-world applications.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

TL;DR: DiagECG integrates time-series and language modeling for processing 12-lead ECG signals and generating clinical text, leveraging symbolic tokenization and instruction tuning to enhance task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated ECG analysis methods struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and lack support for open-ended reasoning.

Method: DiagECG creates symbolic ECG tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module, extends the LLM vocabulary for unified ECG and language processing, pretrains on autoregressive ECG forecasting, and fine-tunes on clinical tasks via instruction tuning.

Result: DiagECG achieves strong performance in ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation tasks while maintaining the ability to generalize to out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: Integrating symbolic ECG token representations into LLMs is effective for advancing medical reasoning, providing a unified framework for diverse clinical tasks.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Motivation: To address the problem of generating plans that achieve goals with minimal disruption to the initial state, balancing action costs and initial state modification.

Method: The study defines planning-based compilations that optimize both action costs and plan disruption, using formalized approaches evaluated through experimental benchmarks.

Result: Experimental benchmarks demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods in generating balanced plans.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that it is feasible to optimize both action costs and plan disruption simultaneously, resulting in plans that achieve goals while minimizing initial state modification.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define

Conclusion: This scalable approach enhances synthetic dataset generation, simplifying preparation for various LLM training needs.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates

automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

*Yekun Zhu,Guang Chen,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the 'Think in Blocks' framework, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically adjust reasoning depth by partitioning processes into tunable blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessively long chains-of-thought in LLMs can result in computational inefficiencies and slower responses, prompting the need for adaptive reasoning based on task complexity.

Method: The framework employs a block-structured paradigm, where the model predicts a reasoning budget (number of blocks) and utilizes a three-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning.

Result: The method facilitates adaptive reasoning, allowing dynamic adjustment of the chain-of-thought during deployment, optimizing for both efficiency and task complexity.

Conclusion: The 'Think in Blocks' framework offers a flexible and efficient approach to reasoning in LLMs, reducing overthinking while maintaining strong performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand cooperative behaviors in autonomous AI agents inspired by human cooperation theories involving interactions and competition.

Method: The study uses a virtual tournament where language model agents in teams play the Prisoner's Dilemma, simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition.

Result: Findings reveal that combining internal team interaction with external rivalry increases overall and initial cooperation levels in the AI agents.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a novel framework for large language model-based AI systems to strategize in social settings and highlights the role of intergroup competition in promoting cooperation.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks in 3D environments due to limitations in dataset question complexity and tool integration.

Method: The proposed approach combines iterative evolution to create complex questions and fine-tuning LLMs with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for better 3D tool usage.

Result: Enhanced accuracy and proficiency in tool usage for complex 3D reasoning tasks using the SQA3D benchmark.

Conclusion: The use of DeepThink3D enables LLMs to perform more effective reasoning in 3D tasks, setting a foundation for further improvements in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using dynamical systems theory to assess reinforcement learning policies' safety and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional verification methods for reinforcement learning struggle to ensure safety and robustness in critical systems.

Method: The framework uses tools like the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent and metrics including MBR, ASAS, and TASAS to analyze RL policies and identify structural dynamics within an RL system.

Result: Experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments reveal flaws in policies that might initially seem successful based on reward metrics alone.

Conclusion: This approach offers a comprehensive method to assess RL policies, highlighting hidden vulnerabilities and providing interpretable guarantees for safety and stability.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

*Alfio Gliozzo,Naweed Khan,Christodoulos Constantinides,Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Nahuel Defosse,Junkyu Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Agentics, a modular framework for agent-based systems allowing structured reasoning and better generalization over data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a more effective way for AI developers to work with data by focusing on modeling data rather than prompt crafting.

Method: Introducing agents abstracted from logical flows to enable logical transduction among data types, utilizing LLMs for connecting and composing data logically.

Result: Empirical validation shows improved scalability and state-of-the-art performance on tasks in question answering, text-to-SQL, and prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Agentics enables a declarative approach for AI workflows, improving data handling and generalization without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

### [31] [Adapting A Vector-Symbolic Memory for Lisp ACT-R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15630)
*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vector-symbolic adaptation of ACT-R's Declarative Memory system called Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM), enabling scalability, improved retrieval mechanisms, and compatibility with existing ACT-R models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implementations of ACT-R's Declarative Memory system lack scalability and an architecturally defined similarity mechanism between memory chunks; HDM addresses these limitations.

Method: The authors integrated HDM into the Lisp ACT-R system, developed vector-based ACT-R functions, created a text processing pipeline for large document input, and established a method for retrieving chunks using vector representations.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate HDM's scalability and chunk-recall advantages while ensuring compatibility with existing ACT-R models, requiring minimal or no model modifications.

Conclusion: HDM holds potential for advancing ACT-R memory functionality, with plans to improve time-context vector representations for better recall and to test the system with decision-making models utilizing instance-based learning theory.

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [32] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method, Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), to understand individual agent behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning without requiring value feedback, using information-theoretic approaches to measure their influence on team behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the explainability and reliability of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning systems by understanding the contributions and behaviors of individual agents within a team, even in the absence of explicit value feedback.

Method: The authors propose the Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs) approach, which uses information-theoretic Shapley values to evaluate each agent's causal effect on teammates' decision-making and instrumental empowerment by assessing decision uncertainty and preference alignment.

Result: The analysis demonstrates the ability of ICVs to reveal the degree to which agents adopt convergent or diverse strategies, both in cooperative and competitive environments, and identify agent behaviors that aid team success by either promoting deterministic decisions or preserving flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a deeper understanding of cooperation dynamics in MARL environments and improves the system's explainability by uncovering beneficial individual agent behaviors and their impact on overall team performance.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a techno-philosophical analysis of the AI lifecycle and its regulatory blind spots through concepts inspired by Simondonian philosophy, focusing on recursive data dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address gaps in AI policymaking by presenting a cohesive framework for understanding the technical and economic dynamics of data within AI systems.

Method: The authors use cross-disciplinary approaches and introduce conceptual tools rooted in Simondonian philosophy to analyze the lifecycle of AI systems.

Result: They highlight regulatory blind spots and escalating power asymmetries led by tech oligarchies while proposing mechanisms like lifecycle audits and recursion transparency to address these issues.

Conclusion: Effective regulation should focus on the recursive nature of AI systems and infrastructures by implementing measures like traceability and accountability to mitigate power imbalances.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between AI research and human subject experimentation by enabling RL environments to be directly tested with human participants.

Method: The authors developed NiceWebRL, a tool that converts Jax-based environments into interfaces for conducting both single-agent and multi-agent online human experiments. They validated its utility through three distinct case studies in cognition, collaboration, and assistance domains.

Result: The tool was successfully applied in three case studies: (1) Development of a novel RL model of cognition benchmarked against humans, (2) Creation of a multi-agent RL algorithm for human-AI collaboration, and (3) Studying human assistance using LLMs in a complex hierarchical task environment.

Conclusion: NiceWebRL proves to be a versatile and powerful tool for researchers interested in developing AI systems that interact, imitate, or assist humans. The library facilitates advancements in Human-AI interaction across multiple domains.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be

case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper measures the environmental impact of AI inference workloads in a production setting, particularly focusing on Google's Gemini AI assistant serving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and mitigating the environmental impact of AI inference workloads, which have accelerated with increased user adoption.

Method: The paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to measure energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption across the AI serving stack, including the hardware, infrastructure, and software levels.

Result: Measurements reveal that the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh, significantly lower than public estimates, and Google's efficiency efforts have reduced energy consumption by 33x and carbon footprint by 44x over one year.

Conclusion: Environmental impact from AI serving is relatively low compared to typical daily activities, but continued efforts for measuring efficiency gains and incentivizing sustainable AI operations remain important.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using state-of-the-art language models to detect parasocial cues in AI-human conversations in real-time, showing promising results on a synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the severe and sometimes tragic effects of parasocial relationships with AI agents on human well-being, and the challenge of detecting such cues in private, gradually developing conversations.

Method: The authors developed a response evaluation framework using a state-of-the-art language model, tested it on a synthetic dataset of 30 dialogues, and used a five-stage iterative evaluation approach under a unanimity rule.

Result: The framework successfully detected all parasocial conversations without false positives and typically identified them within the first few exchanges.

Conclusion: This work provides preliminary evidence that conversation evaluation agents can help prevent the development of harmful parasocial relationships.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), which uses multi-agent Large Language Models for configuration optimization through natural language reasoning, offering interpretability and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in machine learning configuration optimization, such as lack of interpretability in traditional methods and adaptability in automated approaches.

Method: The framework employs a multi-agent LLM system with agents: Advisor, Evaluator, and Optimizer, which utilize textual gradients to refine configurations via natural language reasoning.

Result: LGT achieves significant improvement over traditional methods across six datasets, combining semantic understanding with optimization.

Conclusion: LGT offers a novel, interpretable, and effective approach for configuration optimization in machine learning by leveraging natural language processing.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle computational unreliability from stuck-at faults and the inefficiencies of current fault-mitigation algorithms in analog IMC systems, improving scalability and deployability.

Method: A novel row-column hybrid grouping for weight representation to enhance fault tolerance, combined with Integer Linear Programming for optimizing compilation pipelines.

Result: The approach improves accuracy by up to 8%, enhances compilation speeds by 150x, and increases energy efficiency by 2x in experimental tests on convolutional networks and language models.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide significant advancements in scalability, fault tolerance, accuracy, and efficiency for analog IMC systems, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified co-training framework for LLM content safety, enabling efficient integration of multiple safety behaviors within a single training stage, reducing complexity and improving control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current content safety methods in LLMs, which lack fine-grained, post-deployment controllability and involve multi-stage training pipelines.

Method: A unified co-training framework that integrates positive, negative, and rejective safety behaviors into a single SFT stage, with dynamic switching enabled via system-level instructions, or magic tokens.

Result: The introduced framework matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, outperforms larger models like DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance with an 8B model, and reduces both training complexity and deployment costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and highly controllable approach to content safety in LLMs, supporting diverse deployment scenarios with efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a unified meta-metric for evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models across datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating KGC models is inconsistent due to variations in performance across datasets and metrics, making it hard to determine overall model superiority.

Method: The paper proposes EDAS, a meta-metric normalizing and unifying multi-dataset, multi-metric evaluations into a single score ranging from 0 to 1.

Result: Experimental results show that EDAS successfully produces consistent and generalizable rankings for KGC models across datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR.

Conclusion: EDAS provides a robust and interpretable framework for evaluating KGC models, addressing inconsistencies in multi-metric and multi-dataset evaluations.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to share early insights into MT system performance through automatic evaluations to aid participants in refining their submissions.

Method: MT systems were ranked using automatic metrics, noting potential biases from techniques like re-ranking. This ranking is preliminary and will be refined through human evaluation.

Result: The preliminary ranking highlights MT system performance but may favor systems utilizing advanced re-ranking techniques.

Conclusion: Automatic rankings provide useful early feedback for participants, but ultimate rankings will rely on more reliable human evaluations.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

### [47] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of enhancing large language modelsâ (LLMs) ability to handle multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages by introducing a framework for culturally localizing math word problems with native entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing multilingual benchmarks, which often translate English-centric datasets and fail to account for native socio-cultural elements, thereby restricting LLMs' capabilities in low-resource languages.

Method: The authors propose an LLM-driven cultural localization framework that reconstructs datasets using native names, organizations, and currencies, enabling a more authentic assessment of multilingual mathematical reasoning.

Result: The proposed framework reduces English-centric entity bias, enhances robustness when native entities are introduced, and better reveals LLMs' multilingual math reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The framework successfully localizes math word problems to reflect true socio-cultural contexts, showcasing its utility in improving fairness and capability assessment in multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [48] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen VreÅ¡,Marko Robnik-Å ikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how instruction-tuned large language models can be improved for Slovene machine translation using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on publicly available datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance machine translation capabilities in large language models with limited, easy-to-generate resources, focusing on Slovene as a specific use case.

Method: The GaMS-9B-Instruct model was fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Training data was programmatically curated by translating English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs and ranking translations based on heuristics and metrics like COMET.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed its baseline counterparts with COMET score improvements of ~0.04 and 0.02, respectively, while reducing language and formatting errors.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs can achieve better machine translation performance for specific languages like Slovene using targeted improvements and resource-efficient processes such as DPO.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in conversational XAI systems using large language models by introducing new multilingual datasets and enhanced parsing methods for better multilingual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current ConvXAI systems, including insufficient multilingual training data, challenges in multilingual generalization, and limited support for free-form user-defined inputs.

Method: Introduced MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL dataset; proposed a new parsing approach for better multilingual handling; introduced Compass, a dataset for enhancing custom input extraction.

Result: Evaluated three large language models and BERT variations on the new datasets in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings, demonstrating improved multilingual parsing and intent recognition.

Conclusion: The contributions of MultiCoXQL and Compass extend the capabilities of ConvXAI systems, addressing key linguistic diversity and intent recognition challenges in a multilingual context.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [50] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, which efficiently aligns language models with human preferences during inference, reducing computation costs while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of test-time alignment methods for large language models (LLMs), which involve high computational cost despite their importance in improving safety and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The SSS algorithm uses a draft model trained to align with human preferences to predict tokens, and exploits distributional differences with a target unaligned model to optimize alignment. Acceptance criteria and token distributions are modified for efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: Experiments showed that the SSS algorithm achieves better reward scores while significantly reducing inference costs when aligning weak models to strong ones during test-time.

Conclusion: The SSS algorithm is both an efficient and effective alternative for test-time alignment in LLMs, demonstrating improved performance and practicality.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [51] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LongRecall, a framework for accurately evaluating recall in machine-generated text, addressing issues present in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable recall measurement is essential in critical fields like medicine and law, as well as in tasks like list-based question answering, where missed information can have severe consequences.

Method: LongRecall employs a three-stage process: decomposing answers into individual facts, filtering candidates via lexical and semantic analysis, and verifying alignment using structured entailment checks.

Result: LongRecall significantly improves recall accuracy on three long-form QA benchmarks compared to current lexical and LLM-based methods, showing strong performance via human and LLM judge evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework reduces both false positives and false negatives while handling paraphrased and contextually varied answers, making it a robust tool for recall assessment.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of LLMs such as hallucinations and complex reasoning by combining them with combinatorial inference to enhance structural consistency and predictive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with issues like hallucinations and weak performance on complex reasoning tasks, which stem from their autoregressive nature. The authors aim to use structured prediction and symbolic inference to overcome these limitations.

Method: The approach blends LLMs with combinatorial inference methods for structured prediction. It evaluates various prompting strategies to estimate LLM confidence and incorporates symbolic inference to improve predictions, alongside calibration and fine-tuning for structured prediction tasks.

Result: The experimental results reveal that using symbolic inference with LLM prompting strategies increases both prediction accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, fine-tuning with structured prediction objectives enhances performance on challenging tasks.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with symbolic inference and structured prediction significantly boosts the efficiency and reliability of these models in complex language tasks, underscoring the ongoing importance of structured learning approaches.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nemotron-CC-Math, a high-quality mathematical corpus extracted from Common Crawl using a novel pipeline. It significantly outperforms previous math datasets in scale and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math-focused datasets suffer from degraded quality due to extraction issues, lossy conversions, and challenges in preserving mathematical structure.

Method: The authors developed a layout-aware, domain-agnostic pipeline leveraging scientific text extraction, including a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage, to recover and standardize mathematical content.

Result: The dataset, Nemotron-CC-Math, surpasses prior open math datasets in scale and quality, enabling significant performance gains in math and code reasoning tasks across benchmarks like MATH and MBPP+.

Conclusion: The approach sets a new state of the art in open math pretraining corpora, demonstrating measurable improvements in reasoning tasks and supporting open-source efforts through released code and datasets.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses answering questions with false assumptions using evidence-based techniques to minimize hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to solve the problem of misleading answers generated by LLMs when dealing with questions based on false assumptions, which lack regular answers.

Method: The authors propose reducing the problem to fact verification and employ an approach using external evidence. They also generate and validate atomic assumptions to detect false premises, enhancing interpretability.

Result: Experiments using five LLMs show that leveraging retrieved evidence improves responses, and validating atomic assumptions leads to enhanced accuracy while specifying false assumptions.

Conclusion: Incorporating external evidence and focusing on atomic assumptions is effective for improving LLMsâ ability to handle questions with false assumptions and mitigate hallucinations.

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMDR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating complex visual-grounded dialogues, along with CoLVLM Agent, a framework enhancing LVLMs' reasoning and instruction-following capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in LVLMs' capability to manage complex visual dialogues involving deep reasoning, sustained context, and multi-step instructions.

Method: MMDR-Bench, a 300-scenario dataset, evaluates dialogues across six dimensions. CoLVLM Agent uses a modular cycle of memory, perception, planning, and execution without extensive model retraining.

Result: CoLVLM Agent outperforms state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the MMDR-Bench, achieving higher human evaluation scores and providing deeper reasoning and robust dialogue performance.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and framework improve LVLMs' capabilities for complex multi-modal dialogues, showcasing modular design advantages and better handling of extended dialogue tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [56] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces SemToken, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that improves efficiency and reduces redundancy compared to traditional methods like BPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods rely on frequency statistics, which fail to consider semantic structure and lead to inefficiencies, especially in long-context scenarios.

Method: SemToken employs lightweight encoders to extract semantic embeddings and performs local clustering to merge equivalent tokens. Token granularity is adjusted based on semantic density to enhance coherence.

Result: SemToken reduces token count by up to 2.4Ã and speeds up computation by 1.9Ã on benchmarks like WikiText-103, while maintaining performance in perplexity and accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware tokenization provides a new approach to optimize both tokenization and computation in large language models, improving efficiency without sacrificing outcomes.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fin-PRM, a domain-specific reward model for financial reasoning tasks, achieving significant improvements over general baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) lack the specificity needed for domains such as finance, where reasoning is structured, symbolic, and requires high factual and regulatory accuracy.

Method: Fin-PRM employs step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks. It supports offline and online reward learning for applications like fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and reward-guided inference.

Result: Fin-PRM outperforms general PRMs and baselines in trajectory selection quality on financial benchmarks (e.g., CFLUE, FinQA) and improves model performance by 12.9% in supervised learning, 5.2% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1% in test-time performance.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the efficacy of domain-specialized reward models like Fin-PRM in aligning large language models with rigorous domain-specific reasoning requirements, particularly in financial contexts.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

### [58] [SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212)
*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK optimizes KV cache in LLMs by pruning channel-level redundancies, enhancing sequence processing and saving storage while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of KV cache compression methods that neglect feature-wise importance variations.

Method: A training-free plug-and-play approach using unstructured sparsity to prune and dynamically restore KV entries at the channel level.

Result: SPARK reduces KV cache storage by over 30%, maintains performance with less than 5% degradation even under aggressive pruning.

Conclusion: SPARK robustly balances efficiency and model accuracy, enabling better memory utilization for long-context inference in LLMs.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

### [59] [Select to Know: An Internal-External Knowledge Self-Selection Framework for Domain-Specific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15213)
*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) is proposed to improve domain-specific QA performance in LLMs by combining self-selection strategies with selective supervised fine-tuning, achieving competitive results at reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in domain-specific QA tasks, such as reliance on costly specialized training or noisy retrieval methods, while recognizing their struggle with long-tail knowledge distributions.

Method: The S2K framework utilizes internal-external knowledge self-selection and selective supervised fine-tuning. Additionally, a structured reasoning data generation pipeline and integration of GRPO enhance reasoning ability.

Result: S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and aligns with the performance of domain-pretrained LLMs across benchmarks in medical, legal, and financial QA tasks, all at significantly reduced costs.

Conclusion: The proposed S2K framework successfully balances cost-efficiency with domain-specific QA performance, eliminating reliance on costly domain-specific pretraining while mitigating common challenges like noisy retrievals and hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

### [60] [Self-Guided Function Calling in Large Language Models via Stepwise Experience Recall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15214)
*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces SEER, a self-guided retrieval method for improving multi-step tool usage in LLMs. SEER boosts model performance by incrementally updating an experience pool with successful tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to LLM tool usage struggle with scalability and efficiency due to reliance on static, manually curated libraries or complex demonstrations. Researchers aim to address this inefficiency for growing tool diversity and task complexity.

Method: SEER employs stepwise experience recall for retrieving fine-grained trajectories from an updated experience pool. The pool expands automatically with successful sequences, enhancing the LLM's adaptability to new tasks.

Result: SEER demonstrated improvements in model accuracy on ToolQA tasks by 6.1% and 4.7% for easy and hard questions, respectively. On Ï-bench, accuracy gains were 7.44% and 23.38% using Qwen2.5 models.

Conclusion: SEERâs continuous improvement strategy through experience recall enables LLMs to enhance accuracy and efficiency for multi-step tool usage, outperforming manual approaches as task complexity increases.

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness of checklists for automatic evaluation in generative tasks and finds that selective use improves performance in pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automatic evaluation of generative tasks due to ambiguous criteria, by exploring checklist-based approaches.

Method: They generate checklists using six methods, evaluate their usefulness across eight model sizes, and analyze correlation with human evaluations.

Result: Selective checklist use improves evaluation in pairwise tasks but shows inconsistent benefits in direct scoring. Some checklist items align with human criteria despite weak correlation.

Conclusion: Clearer definition of objective evaluation criteria is necessary for improving both human and automatic evaluations.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

### [62] [VocabTailor: Dynamic Vocabulary Selection for Downstream Tasks in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15229)
*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses memory limitations of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices by introducing VocabTailor, a method that dynamically and efficiently tailors vocabulary components to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs face deployment challenges in resource-constrained environments due to their large memory footprint, primarily from vocabulary-related components. Existing solutions like static vocabulary pruning lack flexibility and cause information loss.

Method: The paper proposes VocabTailor, a framework leveraging the principles of lexical locality and computational asymmetry. It employs a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection approach and enables offloading and on-demand management of vocabulary components.

Result: Experiments show that VocabTailor reduces memory usage of vocabulary-related components by up to 99% with minimal or no loss in task performance, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: VocabTailor demonstrates a significant advancement in memory optimization for SLMs, proving efficient for edge device deployment without compromising task accuracy.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces WangchanThaiInstruct, a Thai instruction tuning dataset, highlighting the need for culturally grounded data to improve large language models' performance in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in English but face performance challenges in low-resource languages like Thai due to the lack of culturally and domain-specific datasets.

Method: This study created WangchanThaiInstruct through a multi-stage process involving human annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers for instruction tuning and evaluation.

Result: Fine-tuned models using WangchanThaiInstruct outperform models using translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating the value of native supervision.

Conclusion: Culturally and professionally grounded datasets are essential for improving the alignment and performance of large language models in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

*Sangmin Lee,Woojin Chung,Seyun Um,Hong-Goo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a pipeline to generate high-quality code-switching datasets for multilingual speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of datasets for multilingual code-switching speech tasks.

Method: Introduced UniCoM pipeline using the SWORDS algorithm to create code-switching speech by substituting words with translations, considering parts of speech.

Result: Developed CS-FLEURS corpus, which achieves high naturalness and intelligibility, performing well on ASR and S2TT tasks.

Conclusion: This approach advances code-switching speech technology, enhancing inclusivity in multilingual systems.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can emulate teachers using a framework called EMNLP, assessing their personality, moral reasoning, and ethical risks. Experiments reveal strengths and vulnerabilities in teacher-emulated LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the psychological and ethical dimensions of LLMs emulating professional roles, particularly as educators, which has been an underexplored area.

Method: The study introduces EMNLP, a framework for profiling personality, moral development, and ethical risks in teacher-role LLMs. It involves 88 moral dilemmas and targeted soft prompt injections for experimentation across 12 LLMs.

Result: Teacher-role LLMs displayed idealized personalities, excelled in abstract moral reasoning, but struggled with emotional scenarios. Stronger reasoning models were more prone to harmful prompt injections, indicating a safety-capability paradox.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first benchmark for assessing psychological and ethical alignment of teacher-role LLMs, highlighting the balance between their capabilities and safety in educational AI contexts.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.

alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE introduces a novel approach to resolving conflicts between an LLM's parametric knowledge and unreliable external context, resulting in better performance on QA and fact-checking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems sometimes fail when retrieved external contexts contradict the inherent knowledge of LLMs, leading to incorrect outputs. Addressing this context-memory conflict is vital for improving trustworthy and adaptive systems.

Method: The proposed CARE model utilizes a context assessor to encode compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. It employs grounded/adversarial soft prompting strategies to identify unreliable content and guide reasoning toward the most reliable knowledge.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that CARE achieved a 5.0% performance boost across QA and fact-checking benchmarks by successfully mitigating context-memory conflicts.

Conclusion: CARE shows promise in advancing RAG systems by increasing their reliability and adaptability, thus ensuring more accurate and trustworthy outcomes in knowledge-intensive applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

### [67] [TComQA: Extracting Temporal Commonsense from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15274)
*Lekshmi R Nair,Arun Sankar,Koninika Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) struggle with inferring temporal commonsense and proposes a pipeline for mining such information from text, creating the TComQA dataset for improved temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding temporal context is often implicit and challenging for machines, which hinders the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in tasks involving events' duration or feasibility.

Method: The authors developed a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline using LLMs to analyze text and construct the TComQA dataset, validated by crowdsourcing.

Result: TComQA achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense, and models trained with this dataset outperform a fine-tuned LLM on temporal question answering tasks.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of incorporating mined temporal commonsense into datasets for improving LLM reasoning on event durations and timings, offering a significant contribution to temporal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

*Abdul Rehman,Jian-Jun Zhang,Xiaosong Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CUPE is a lightweight model aimed at universal phoneme recognition. It achieves competitive results by focusing on short speech segments, leveraging fundamental acoustic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many speech tasks need phoneme representations devoid of context to enhance cross-lingual processing performance.

Method: CUPE uses short, fixed-width window processingâ120 msâto extract acoustic properties fundamental to all languages. It operates with fewer parameters while maintaining high accuracy.

Result: CUPE demonstrates strong cross-lingual performance through supervised and self-supervised learning on various datasets and zero-shot tests.

Conclusion: Universal phoneme recognition can be achieved by modeling fundamental acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows, as CUPE exemplifies.

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the need for a systematic review and analysis of the evaluation benchmarks used in assessing large language models, which are essential for measuring model performance and guiding development.

Method: The authors reviewed 283 benchmarks, organizing them into three categories: general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific, while critically analyzing existing issues within benchmarks.

Result: The study revealed key issues in current benchmarks, including inflated scores from data contamination, unfair evaluations due to biases, and lack of credibility and dynamic environment testing.

Conclusion: Future benchmark designs should address these issues by being careful about data contamination, more equitable in evaluation, and capable of assessing process credibility and dynamic environments.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive evaluations and mitigation strategies for trustworthiness risks specific to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Method: The study develops MultiTrust-X, categorized into three dimensions: five trust aspects, two novel risk types, and mitigation strategies. It includes 32 tasks, 28 datasets, and evaluations of 30 MLLMs and 8 mitigation methods.

Result: Experimental results reveal vulnerabilities in current models, such as trustworthiness gaps and risk amplification. Controlled analysis exposes limitations and trade-offs in existing mitigation methods.

Conclusion: Future improvements should focus on leveraging reasoning for safety-performance balance. The proposed Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) improves outcomes, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel adaptive speculative decoding method is proposed using confidence-modulated drafting and verification, leading to faster generation and improved results in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding under varying uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: Dynamic drafting based on entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures, coupled with confidence-modulated verification.

Result: Significant speedups and improved BLEU and ROUGE scores for machine translation and summarization tasks.

Conclusion: This framework offers a principled, flexible solution for robust large language model decoding in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how scaling language model vocabularies affects performance, demonstrating that larger vocabularies reduce tokenized text complexity and primarily improve performance on frequent words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent trends in language modeling favor larger vocabularies, but the reasons behind their benefits remain unclear.

Method: The authors conducted experiments to scale vocabulary size from 24K to 196K, analyzed tokenized text complexity using Kolmogorov complexity, decomposed cross-entropy loss, and assessed the impact of embedding norms and parameter scaling.

Result: Larger vocabularies lower the complexity of tokenized text, mainly improving certainty for frequent words while hurting performance on rare words. Embedding norm constraints reveal the model exploits token-frequency imbalance.

Conclusion: The study reframes the benefit of larger vocabularies as a reduction in tokenized text complexity and offers insights for tokenizer-model co-design and pre-training dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews 134 studies on evidence-based text generation with LLMs, introduces a unified taxonomy, and analyzes 300 evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent terminology, evaluation practices, and lack of benchmarks in evidence-based text generation with LLMs prompted the need for systematic analysis and unification.

Method: The authors systematically analyzed 134 papers, created a taxonomy for evidence-based text generation, and evaluated 300 metrics across seven dimensions, emphasizing citation-based approaches.

Result: The study identifies distinct characteristics, representative methods, open challenges, and promising future directions in evidence-based text generation research.

Conclusion: A comprehensive framework and analysis for evidence-based text generation with LLMs is provided, aiming to unify and advance the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on

### [74] [When Audio and Text Disagree: Revealing Text Bias in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15407)
*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Audio-Language Models when dealing with inconsistent audio-text inputs using the proposed MCR-BENCH benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LALMs handle conflicting information between audio and text modalities.

Method: The authors introduce MCR-BENCH, conduct extensive evaluations, and propose mitigation strategies like supervised finetuning to explore text bias in LALMs.

Result: LALMs show significant text bias, leading to degraded performance in audio-centric tasks and overconfidence in contradictory scenarios.

Conclusion: Improved training for balanced modality use and advanced fusion mechanisms are necessary for robust performance in conflicting multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLaSO, the first fully open framework for large-scale speech-language modeling, closing gaps in reproducibility and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented architectures, lack of transparency, and incomplete release of training components have hindered the LSLM field, compared to more cohesive vision-language modeling efforts.

Method: The authors created an end-to-end framework, LLaSO, and included datasets for alignment, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, as well as training a reference model using this framework.

Result: The LLaSO-Base model (3.8B parameters) trained on their public data resulted in a strong baseline with a normalized score of 0.72, surpassing similar models.

Conclusion: LLaSO provides an open standard with complete datasets, models, and evaluation tools to unify and accelerate the field of LSLMs, though challenges in unseen generalization remain.

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing concerns surrounding privacy risks in language models, which are trained on sensitive data and can leak information.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive analysis of privacy-preserving approaches in language modeling by evaluating their strengths and limitations.

Result: Findings provide valuable insights into privacy strategies for language models, emphasizing strengths, limitations, and areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to advancing research in privacy-preserving language models and suggests future directions for improvement.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can

about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

M-Help, specifically designed to detect help-seeking behavior on social media.
The dataset goes beyond traditional labels by identifying not only help-seeking
activity but also specific mental health disorders and their underlying causes,
such as relationship challenges or financial stressors. AI models trained on
M-Help can address three key tasks: identifying help-seekers, diagnosing mental
health conditions, and uncovering the root causes of issues.

*Mohammad Ibrahim Qani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of translating non-equivalent words between languages and introduces professional methods to render them effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misunderstandings arise from non-equivalent words in translation, as they lack direct counterparts in target languages.

Method: The study relies on library-based research to identify and professionally render non-equivalent words.

Result: The paper provides strategies for rendering non-equivalent words and successfully translates 25 words from Dar and Uzbek into English and Russian.

Conclusion: It emphasizes the significance of effectively translating non-equivalent words to ensure accurate cross-language understanding, while identifying gaps for further research.

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyTOD, a task-oriented dialogue agent using executable code for dialogue state tracking and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TOD agents struggle with accurate dialogue state tracking essential for structured dialogue policies.

Method: PyTOD employs constrained decoding via a language model for state tracking in line with API schemata and applies feedback for error correction.

Result: PyTOD outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on the SGD benchmark.

Conclusion: Execution-aware state tracking greatly enhances dialogue state tracking and user goal estimation in TOD systems.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadReason, a framework for evaluating radiology reports that provides detailed sub-scores across error types and interpretable justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for radiology reports are either too generic or rely on non-transparent models, which limits their utility in clinical practice.

Method: The paper proposes RadReason, which applies Group Relative Policy Optimization with two innovations: Sub-score Dynamic Weighting for adaptive error prioritization and Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling for improved policy gradient updates.

Result: In experiments using the ReXVal benchmark, RadReason outperforms existing offline metrics and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4-based evaluations, maintaining explainability and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: RadReason offers a clinically useful, interpretable, and effective approach for evaluating radiology reports, with the potential to advance real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

*Vedasamhitha Challapalli,Konduru Venkat Sai,Piyush Pratap Singh,Rupesh Prasad,Arvind Maurya,Atul Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation, which demonstrates a 17% improvement in offer acceptance rates compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance revenue and customer satisfaction through personalized marketing by leveraging intelligent, data-driven strategies for offer generation as current solutions don't fully exploit personalization potential.

Method: The authors develop SLM4Offer, a generative AI model, by fine-tuning Google's T5-Small 60M language model using a contrastive learning approach with InfoNCE loss.

Result: Experimental results show a 17% improvement in offer acceptance rate compared to a supervised fine-tuning baseline, validating the model's enhancements.

Conclusion: SLM4Offer effectively improves personalized offer generation using contrastive learning, demonstrating the benefits of adaptive learning behaviours in reshaping latent spaces and increasing generalizability.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

*Sai Sundaresan,Harshita Chopra,Atanu R. Sinha,Koustava Goswami,Nagasai Saketh Naidu,Raghav Karan,N Anushka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HeTLM, a clusterwise training method tailored for subjective user browsing behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges posed by subjective and idiosyncratic user behaviors, especially in the domain of web browsing, where existing large language models may fail to provide personalized alignment.

Method: The researchers propose HeTLM, a methodology that trains small language models using a cluster-specific approach to better represent subjective behaviors.

Result: Findings indicate that small LMs trained with HeTLM outperform large pretrained models, achieve better alignment across multiple users, and improve performance consistency.

Conclusion: Cluster-specific small LMs are superior in adapting to subjective user behavior, offering better representation, higher mean performance, and reduced variance in outputs compared to single LMs.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores curriculum learning for pre-training language models by using training data influence as a difficulty metric, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited success of curriculum learning in pre-training language models by rethinking difficulty metrics.

Method: Utilizing training data influence scores to sort examples during the curriculum learning process.

Result: Models trained using this approach outperform random order training by over 10 percentage points in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning for language models benefits significantly when adopting model-centric difficulty metrics rather than conventional human-centered ones.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces HebID, the first Hebrew corpus for detecting nuanced social identities in Israeli political discourse using machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multilingual, culturally-specific datasets for detecting nuanced social identities, particularly in non-English political discourse.

Method: Created HebID, a Hebrew corpus of 5,536 sentences annotated for 12 social identities, benchmarked various language models, and analyzed linguistic patterns using the developed classifier.

Result: Hebrew-tuned language models performed best (macro-F1 = 0.74). The classifier revealed patterns in identity portrayal related to popularity, trends, clustering, and gender in political contexts.

Conclusion: HebID is a valuable resource for studying Hebrew social identities and offers insights for expanding this research methodology to other non-English contexts.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

TL;DR: Dream 7B is a cutting-edge diffusion-based language model featuring superior performance and flexible generation capabilities, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in sequential token generation by autoregressive models and enhance language modeling with parallel refinement techniques.

Method: Utilized discrete diffusion modeling with AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive token-level noise rescheduling.

Result: Superior performance in general, mathematical, and coding tasks, along with enhanced generation flexibility, infilling capabilities, and trade-offs between quality and speed.

Conclusion: Dream 7B advances diffusion language modeling with innovative techniques and releases its variants for further exploration.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

*Naama Rivlin-Angert,Guy Mor-Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on studying political delegitimization discourse (PDD) using computational analysis in Hebrew texts from speeches, social media, and news outlets. A model was developed for automatic detection and analysis of PDD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to understand and measure symbolic attacks on the normative validity of political entities, an area underexplored in automatic discourse analysis.

Method: A Hebrew corpus of 10,410 sentences was annotated for PDD, and a two-stage classification pipeline integrating finetuned encoder models and LLMs was created. The model was trained for binary detection and further categorization of PDD features.

Result: The model achieved an F1 of 0.74 for PDD detection and macro-F1 of 0.67 for characteristic classification. Through its application, a rise in PDD over time and its higher prevalence on social media and among specific political demographics were observed.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that automated PDD analysis is feasible and valuable for better understanding democratic discourse over time, platforms, and political contexts.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafetyFlow, an automated system for constructing safety benchmarks for large language models (LLMs), addressing inefficiencies and limitations in traditional manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety benchmarks are labor-intensive, time-consuming, redundant, and lack sufficient difficulty.

Method: SafetyFlow is a fully automated agent-flow system that uses seven specialized agents equipped with diverse tools to generate comprehensive safety benchmarks autonomously.

Result: SafetyFlow created SafetyFlowBench, a dataset containing 23,446 high-quality queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power, demonstrating significant resource and time savings.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow provides an efficient and reliable solution for LLM safety evaluation, overcoming traditional benchmark limitations and enhancing evaluation processes.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: The expense and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make targeted applications in areas such as sales and marketing unfeasible.

Method: Introduced Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned for specific, domain-focused use cases to reduce computational costs.

Result: Achieved domain-specific response generation at a significantly lower cost compared to LLMs.

Conclusion: Trained, optimized small models can effectively replace larger, costly models for high-value, specialized applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these
creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep
cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing
outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept
of "Trained Miniatures" - Small Language Models(SLMs) fine-tuned for specific,

*Peng Ding,Wen Sun,Dailin Li,Wei Zou,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Chen,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies a safety gap in large language models (LLMs) whereby they are better at detecting harmful content than preventing it. The authors propose SDGO, a reinforcement learning framework to improve LLM safety by aligning detection and generation capabilities without requiring external data or models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in LLMs where they can detect harmful requests but fail to defend against them effectively.

Method: The proposed method, SDGO, uses reinforcement learning with the model's discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to iteratively enhance the generation safety.

Result: SDGO improves model safety against out-of-distribution jailbreaking attacks while maintaining helpfulness on general tasks, using minimal discriminative samples.

Conclusion: SDGO optimizes LLM safety by aligning their detection and generation capabilities, achieving robust performance and enhancing safety without needing external annotated data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Motivation: The rapid growth of academic literature makes manual creation of survey articles impractical, necessitating automated solutions and standardized benchmarks for evaluation.

Method: They propose SurGE, which includes test instances (with topic descriptions, expert-written surveys, and references) and a large academic corpus; they also introduce an automated evaluation framework with four scoring dimensions.

Result: The evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches using SurGE reveals that survey generation is still highly challenging, even for advanced frameworks.

Conclusion: Survey generation by LLMs remains a complex task requiring continued research. The open-sourced SurGE benchmark provides a foundation for future advancements.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

### [91] [Position Bias Mitigates Position Bias:Mitigate Position Bias Through Inter-Position Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15709)
*Yifei Wang,Feng Xiong,Yong Wang,Linjing Li,Xiangxiang Chu,Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Positional bias in long-context comprehension is addressed through Pos2Distill, a position-to-position knowledge distillation framework. This framework enhances performance uniformly across contextual positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias affects long-context comprehension by leading to uneven sensitivity across contextual locations. The paper aims to overcome this challenge.

Method: The Pos2Distill framework uses position-to-position knowledge distillation to redistribute capabilities from stronger contextual positions to weaker ones. Two variants, Pos2Distill-RÂ¹ (retrieval-focused) and Pos2Distill-RÂ² (reasoning-focused), are designed based on observed bias patterns.

Result: Pos2Distill improves uniformity in contextual positions and boosts performance in long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. The two implementations demonstrate mutual cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: Pos2Distill successfully mitigates positional bias, enhances capabilities uniformly, and provides superior task performance across retrieval and reasoning contexts.

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews Bangla stemming, identifies significant research gaps, and proposes future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla is underrepresented in digital resources, and stemming can simplify processing for this highly-inflectional language.

Method: Conducts a survey of Bangla stemming approaches, critiques evaluation methods, and suggests improvements.

Result: Identifies gaps, such as scarce implementations and insufficient metrics, highlighting issues with current methodologies.

Conclusion: Advocates for robust Bangla stemmers and continued research to improve language processing.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

*Xinyi Ling,Hanwen Du,Zhihui Zhu,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the EcomMMMU dataset and highlights limitations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in leveraging e-commerce visual data effectively. It proposes a new method, SUMEI, to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale datasets for multimodal e-commerce data and investigate how visual content impacts task performance.

Method: The researchers created EcomMMMU, a large dataset with 406,190 samples and designed 8 tasks to benchmark MLLM effectiveness. They also developed SUMEI, a method to strategically utilize images via predicting their visual utility.

Result: The study observes that images do not consistently improve task performance and can sometimes degrade it. SUMEI demonstrated effectiveness and robustness in addressing these challenges.

Conclusion: Multimodal models struggle to harness visual richness effectively in e-commerce tasks, but data-driven strategies like SUMEI can improve utilization and results.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in large language models (LLMs) for medical diagnosis, such as knowledge gaps and hallucinations, while improving feedback traceability in reasoning.

Method: Introduced Deep-DxSearch, an end-to-end system based on reinforcement learning, combining a medical retrieval corpus with tailored rewards for steering retrieval-augmented reasoning across scenarios.

Result: Deep-DxSearch outperformed prompt-engineering and training-free retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, surpassing baselines like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 in diagnostic accuracy for various cases.

Conclusion: The innovative reinforcement-learning-driven approach enhances diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and reliability for clinical use, validated via experiments, ablations, and case analyses.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

TL;DR: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) improves Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance in various reasoning tasks, validated by comprehensive benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tasks requiring precise computation despite advancements like chain-of-thought reasoning, creating the need to explore external tools through TIR.

Method: The authors introduced ReasonZoo, a benchmark with nine reasoning categories, and proposed two metrics, PAC and AUC-PCC, to assess TIR's efficiency in enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Result: Empirical evaluations showed that TIR-enabled models outperform non-TIR ones across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains, demonstrating reduced overthinking and streamlined reasoning.

Conclusion: TIR generalizes well across diverse reasoning tasks, enhancing efficiency and offering significant improvements in LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of benchmarking for AI agents' ability to solve dynamic, multi-step tasks through tool usage in realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce LiveMCP-101, a curated benchmark of 101 real-world queries evaluated via ground-truth execution plans, alongside iterative query refinement and error analysis.

Result: Frontline large language models succeed in less than 60% of cases, illustrating substantial challenges in tool orchestration efficiency.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101 provides a standardized evaluation framework highlighting current limitations and guiding advancements in autonomous AI systems' tool-integration capabilities.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

### [97] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an alternative training objective for facial landmark detection, moving away from the traditional Soft-argmax approach, and achieves state-of-the-art results with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial landmark detection is crucial for various tasks such as pose estimation and expression analysis. Traditional methods rely on Soft-argmax, a differentiable approximation, for training deep-net models, but exploring alternatives could improve efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors revisit the use of Soft-argmax and propose a structured prediction framework as an alternative training objective to overcome dependency on this differentiable approximation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, 300W), achieving competitive accuracy and 2.2x faster convergence during training.

Conclusion: Structured prediction is a viable alternative to Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection, offering faster convergence and competitive performance, challenging the traditional choice in this domain.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

Motivation: To enhance image classification by leveraging the modeling capabilities of GCNs and Voronoi diagrams in handling relational and complex data structures.

Method: Images are represented as graphs with regions or pixels as vertices, optimized using Delaunay triangulations, and processed using a GCN-based model integrated with Voronoi diagrams.

Conclusion: Combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams establishes a powerful tool for advanced image classification, driving potential advancements in computer vision and graph-based learning.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This

*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces YOPO, a novel single-stage RGB-only framework for unifying object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately recovering the 9-DoF pose of unseen objects using only a single RGB image, avoiding reliance on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage pipelines.

Method: The method, YOPO, combines a transformer detector, a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost into a single-stage framework trained end-to-end with RGB images.

Result: YOPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on REAL275, reaching 79.6% $\\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\\circ$$10\\rm{cm}$ metric, outpacing other RGB-only methods and narrowing the gap with RGB-D systems.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to jointly achieve high-performance object detection and category-level pose estimation in a unified, RGB-only framework without additional data.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified approach for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attacks using a modality-agnostic framework that pairs genuine and attack selfies, achieving superior performance on benchmark tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face recognition systems struggle to handle both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries simultaneously, requiring separate detectors which increase complexity and latency while leaving vulnerabilities to combined attack types.

Method: The paper proposes a Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that takes automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to train a system that learns liveness cues regardless of modality, simplifying detection with a unified model.

Result: The method achieved an average classification error rate (ACER) of 2.10% and outperformed previous solutions in the Unified Physical-Digital Attack Detection benchmark of the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs), efficient, and effective solution for detecting combined physical-digital spoofing attacks, with training completed in under 1 hour, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TAIGen, a training-free and highly efficient adversarial attack method based on diffusion models, generating competitive attacks in as few as 3-20 sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a necessity for fast, high-quality adversarial attacks as existing methods either produce low-quality images or require substantial computational effort.

Method: The key innovation is introducing perturbations during the mixing intervals instead of processing all timesteps and employing a selective RGB channel strategy to enhance adversarial success while preserving visual quality.

Result: TAIGen achieves high visual quality with PSNR > 30 dB, generates adversarial examples 10x faster, and demonstrates impactful attacks with high success rates across multiple models (e.g., 97.8% against ShuffleNet). It has the lowest robust accuracy compared to defenses.

Conclusion: TAIGen is an efficient and effective method for generating adversarial examples, significantly outperforming existing approaches in terms of attack success rates, computational speed, and image quality preservation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ enhances concealed visual perception (CVP) by proposing a reversible unfolding network leveraging both mask and RGB domains, incorporating a Bernoulli diffusion model for refined segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVP methods underuse the RGB domain and focus on reversible strategies in mask domains, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RUN++ uses a multi-stage deep network combining CORE, CARE, and FINE modules. FINE employs Bernoulli diffusion for refined segmentation of uncertain regions.

Result: RUN++ improves segmentation accuracy by focusing on ambiguous areas, minimizing false positives and negatives using its generative enhancement.

Conclusion: RUN++ offers a robust CVP framework, adaptable to real-world scenarios, and establishes a bi-level optimization framework for enduring system effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CurveFlow, a novel framework that introduces curvature guidance to improve text-to-image generation in terms of semantic alignment and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rectified flow models often rely on linear trajectories, which may pass through low-probability data regions, negatively impacting semantic alignment and instructional compliance.

Method: CurveFlow incorporates curvature guidance directly into flow paths, using robust curvature regularization to smooth out non-linear trajectories. This enhances the generation's adherence to captions and instructions.

Result: CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, outperforming baseline methods like Rectified Diffusion and excelling in semantic consistency metrics (e.g., BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CLAIR) on datasets such as MS COCO 2014 and 2017.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling in CurveFlow notably improves the semantic consistency and quality of generated images, offering a more faithful instruction-following capability. The code is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is

*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management strategy using genetic algorithms to mitigate disruptions in multi-view 3D reconstruction systems in just-in-time edge environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are increasingly used for rapid situational awareness in scenarios like emergency response and public safety, where real-time reliability is critical. However, disruptions in edge environments can degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: The authors propose a novel method inspired by portfolio theory to manage edge resources. A genetic algorithm is employed to solve the camera selection optimization problem, ensuring resilience to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions.

Result: The proposed methodology improves reconstruction quality compared to traditional baselines, as demonstrated using publicly available and custom 3D datasets under various disruption scenarios.

Conclusion: The method enhances reliability and guarantees quality satisfaction for 3D reconstruction in dynamic and disrupted edge environments, proving its utility over baseline strategies.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

### [106] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA is a no-reference image quality assessment framework that uses self-supervised learning with hierarchical ranking and contrastive methods, achieving superior generalization performance without requiring subjective labels or auxiliary inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in NR-IQA, such as dataset biases and reliance on subjective or additional labels, which hinder generalization across diverse distortions.

Method: HiRQA employs hierarchical ranking through a higher-order ranking loss, embedding distance loss for feature-perceptual alignment, and contrastive alignment with textual prompts. The system learns representations from synthetic distortions for transferability.

Result: HiRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, generalizes effectively to both synthetic and authentic image distortions, and demonstrates scalability with a lightweight variant capable of real-time deployment at 3.5 ms per image.

Conclusion: HiRQA delivers scalable, high-performing, and generalizable image quality assessment without dependence on subjective labels or extra modalities, marking a significant step forward in NR-IQA reliability and practicality.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XDR-LVLM is an interpretable deep learning framework for diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), offering both high diagnostic accuracy and natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness, and existing deep learning approaches face barriers in clinical adoption due to their lack of transparency.

Method: The paper introduces XDR-LVLM, a framework that uses Vision-Language Large Models enhanced with a Medical Vision Encoder, Multi-task Prompt Engineering, and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to analyze fundus images and generate explanatory diagnostic reports.

Result: On the DDR dataset, XDR-LVLM achieved a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and an F1 Score of 79.92% for diagnosis, alongside strong concept detection performance. Human evaluations also confirmed the clinical relevance of the generated explanations.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM successfully combines high diagnostic accuracy with interpretability, addressing the transparency gap in automated diabetic retinopathy diagnosis for clinical application.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

### [108] [MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)
*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,RÃ¼diger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MeSS, a pipeline for generating realistic outdoor scenes using city mesh models as geometric priors. It addresses challenges in 3D scene generation by enhancing image diffusion models for improved cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mesh models lack realistic textures, limiting their use in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving.

Method: The proposed pipeline has three main stages: sparse view generation using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets, intermediate view propagation via AGInpaint, and global visual consistency correction with the GCAlign module. Concurrently, a 3D Gaussian Splatting scene is reconstructed on the mesh surface.

Result: MeSS offers superior geometric alignment and generation quality compared to existing approaches, producing high-quality, style-consistent 3D scenes.

Conclusion: MeSS enhances texture realism in mesh models, enabling diverse rendering styles and broader applicability in virtual urban scenarios.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

*Arjun Srinivasan,Anubhav Paras,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning-based method to generate adversarial behaviors for rule-based agents in reinforcement learning environments, particularly targeting safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of rule-based agent models in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where proper behavior modeling of surrounding agents is crucial.

Method: The authors propose a learning-based approach to derive adversarial behaviors. These behaviors are designed to create failure scenarios for rule-based agents in reinforcement learning environments.

Result: The adversarial agent's effectiveness is demonstrated by evaluating it against rule-based agents, showing a decrease in cumulative rewards, which indicates successful adversarial disruptions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of adversarial behavior modeling and demonstrates that such an approach can expose vulnerabilities in rule-based reinforcement learning systems, especially for critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

*Leiyue Zhao,Yuechen Yang,Yanfan Zhu,Haichun Yang,Yuankai Huo,Paul D. Simonson,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic pipeline to enhance segmentation precision in renal pathology by converting binary masks into instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods in renal pathology are limited to binary masks, restricting precision in downstream morphological analyses.

Method: They propose DyMorph-B2I, a pipeline combining watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, integrated with adaptive tuning and geometric refinement.

Result: Experimental validation shows DyMorph-B2I surpasses individual and combined classical segmentation methods in separating complex renal structures.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I enhances instance-level segmentation for renal pathology, enabling accurate morphometric analysis. The tool is open-source.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline
is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/DyMorph-B2I.

*Vipooshan Vipulananthan,Kumudu Mohottala,Kavindu Chinthana,Nimsara Paramulla,Charith D Chitraranjan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAGNet, a model designed to improve accident prediction using dash-cam videos, surpassing previous methods in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance road safety by predicting accidents early using cost-effective dash-cam video inputs, rather than expensive and complex sensor setups.

Method: The approach utilizes improved spatio-temporal features aggregated through a recurrent network, targeting accident prediction via dash-cam video analysis.

Result: STAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks with better average precision and mean time-to-collision, validated across three public datasets.

Conclusion: STAGNet demonstrates its potential as a scalable and effective solution for accident prediction from dash-cam videos, advancing ADAS systems.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

### [112] [Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228)
*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TriMM, a generative 3D modeling approach leveraging multi-modal data (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, point clouds) to enhance texture and geometry quality in 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generative models typically operate in single-modality paradigms or restrict themselves to 3D structures, neglecting the potential of multi-modal data and reducing dataset versatility.

Method: TriMM integrates multi-modalities through collaborative multi-modal coding, employs auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision, and utilizes a triplane latent diffusion model for 3D generation.

Result: TriMM achieves strong performance with minimal training data, leveraging multi-modal information, and proves adaptable for RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the value of combining multi-modal data for high-quality, efficient 3D asset modeling and opens broader applications for 3D generative models.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

### [113] [Center-Oriented Prototype Contrastive Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15231)
*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a clustering framework called center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering (CPCC) to improve class discrimination by reducing prototype calculation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods struggle to effectively solve class conflicts, particularly due to deviations in hard prototype calculations.

Method: The proposed framework includes a soft prototype contrastive module to refine prototype calculations using cluster center probabilities and a dual consistency learning module to ensure semantic and intra-cluster alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show CPCC's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The CPCC framework successfully reduces conflicts between classes and improves clustering performance, backed by reliable prototype calculation and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in aerial vision-and-language navigation by proposing a dual-altitude UAV system, introducing a novel task (DuAl-VLN), a supporting dataset (HaL-13k), and framework (AeroDuo).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating outdoor environments using UAVs is difficult due to extended trajectories and complex movement. The paper seeks to overcome these challenges while leveraging UAVs' mobility advantages.

Method: A dual-altitude UAV framework is proposed, pairing a high-altitude UAV for broad reasoning with a low-altitude UAV for precise navigation. A dataset, HaL-13k, and collaborative framework, AeroDuo, support training and evaluation.

Result: The proposed approach combines complementary UAV strengths using a large language model and lightweight navigation policy, ensuring efficient collaboration with minimal data exchange.

Conclusion: DuAl-VLN and AeroDuo enhance UAV navigation by balancing mobility and learnable motion space, improving generalization in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to accelerate diffusion model sampling called skipped-step sampling, bypassing intermediate steps while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome inefficiencies in traditional diffusion models that rely on lengthy sequential generation processes and explore alternatives that retain training objectives.

Method: The proposed method, skipped-step sampling, bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps during sampling and integrates with DDIM techniques for enhanced performance.

Result: Experiments on major diffusion models like OpenAI ADM and Stable Diffusion demonstrate high-quality outputs with significantly fewer sampling steps using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Skipped-step sampling achieves efficient and high-quality generation through Markovian processes, showing it as a fundamental capability of pretrained diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the image compression processes by making them user-friendly for unprofessional users while integrating versatile functionalities within a unified framework.

Method: Introduce a multi-functional coding framework, develop an interactive coding agent with in-context learning and expert feedback, and build a benchmark (IIC-bench) for evaluation specialized in interactive image compression.

Result: Comp-X efficiently understands coding requests via textual interaction while maintaining competitive compression performance within a single framework.

Conclusion: Comp-X offers a novel approach to image compression, paving the way for artificial general intelligence (AGI) implementation in this domain.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Conclusion: By integrating pathology-specific knowledge and interpretability through image-text associations, Ano-NAViLa improves robustness, accuracy, and interpretability in detecting anomalies in pathology images.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the first-detect-then-reason paradigm in lane topology reasoning, which results in suboptimal performance due to narrow supervision opportunities.

Method: Develops a redundancy assignment strategy by restructuring the Transformer decoder with switched cross-attention and self-attention layers, enabling one-to-many topology supervision. Also, incorporates parallel cross-attention blocks for diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 show that RATopo consistently improves lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance and is compatible with existing frameworks.

Conclusion: RATopo enhances topology reasoning in autonomous driving by introducing quantity-rich and diverse topology supervision methods, proving effective and adaptable.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

TL;DR: The paper presents DesignCLIP, a framework leveraging CLIP models for advanced design patent analysis, achieving superior performance in classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional image-based patent analysis methods, which lack comprehensive visual and semantic context, by utilizing advancements in vision-language models.

Method: This paper proposes DesignCLIP, a unified framework that incorporates class-aware classification, contrastive learning, detailed captions for patent images, and multi-view image learning to optimize design patent analysis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models in patent-related tasks such as classification and retrieval.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of multimodal approaches like DesignCLIP in improving the reliability, accuracy, and innovation in design patent analysis, supporting its application to a wide range of practical tasks.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), an innovative framework to classify fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) in ultrasound videos, improving accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses issues in CHD detection including image noise, variability in probe positioning, neglect of temporal features, binary classification limitations, and uncalibrated predictions in existing automated machine learning models.

Method: TPA uses image-text foundation model features combined with prompt-aware contrastive learning. It extracts video frame features using an image encoder, aggregates them with a temporal extractor, aligns video representations with class-specific text prompts, and enhances calibration via a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module.

Result: TPA achieves state-of-the-art performance with macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis and improves calibration error rates on private CHD datasets. On EchoNet-Dynamic public dataset, it increases macro F1 scores by 4.73% for systolic dysfunction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Temporal Prompt Alignment framework efficiently integrates temporal modeling and uncertainty quantification, providing a compelling solution to clinical challenges in fetal CHD detection, enhancing accuracy and reliability in ultrasound video analysis.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "BasketLiDAR," the first multimodal dataset combining LiDAR point clouds with synchronized multi-camera footage for real-time 3D player tracking in basketball. It also proposes an innovative MOT framework achieving high tracking accuracy with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing player tracking in sports often struggles with real-time analysis due to the limitations of video-based methods, especially in occlusion-rich environments like basketball.

Method: Developed the BasketLiDAR dataset (LiDAR + multi-camera data) and proposed MOT algorithms using LiDAR-only tracking and multimodal data fusion for improved accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed real-time tracking performance with improved accuracy, especially under challenging occlusion scenarios, outperforming conventional video-only methods.

Conclusion: This paper advances player-tracking technology in sports using a novel multimodal approach, overcoming traditional challenges, and offers a publicly accessible database to support future research.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

*Wutao Liu,YiDan Wang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAG-SEG, a training-free framework addressing camouflaged object detection (COD) using two stages: RAG for prompt generation and SEG for refinement, achieving competitive performance with low computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COD tasks are challenging due to the high visual similarity between objects and backgrounds, and existing methods are computationally expensive or rely on fine-tuning, which is inefficient.

Method: The paper proposes RAG-SEG, which combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse prompts and SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refining the segmentation output without training.

Result: RAG-SEG achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on COD benchmarks, and all experiments were conducted on a personal laptop, showcasing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RAG-SEG offers an effective and computationally lightweight solution to COD tasks, eliminating traditional training requirements and demonstrating significant potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of text-to-video diffusion models has raised concerns about misuse, particularly in generating harmful or misleading content due to unauthorized datasets.

Method: VideoEraser employs a plug-and-play module with two stages: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG).

Result: Experimentally, VideoEraser outperforms prior methods, reducing undesirable content generation by 46% across four tasks: object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure.

Conclusion: VideoEraser effectively mitigates risks associated with T2V diffusion models, showing improved performance in content suppression and ensuring model robustness across diverse applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Motivation: Predicting whether a pedestrian intends to cross the road is vital for autonomous vehicles to ensure safety and make informed maneuvers.

Method: The researchers used deep learning techniques, integrating pose extraction with three sequence modeling approaches (GRU, LSTM, and 1D CNN) for temporal predictions, tested in an experimental video setup.

Result: GRU outperformed LSTM in predicting intent accuracy, while 1D CNN excelled in speed.

Conclusion: Integrating pose detection with sequence modeling provides a promising approach for efficiently predicting road-crossing intents, crucial in autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how Video Large Language Models internally process video data through systematic analysis using attention knockouts. It reveals that video information is primarily extracted in early layers, intermediate layers have critical impact, and spatial-temporal modeling heavily relies on language-guided retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the internal mechanisms of Video Large Language Models, especially since most existing efforts focus solely on performance improvement.

Method: The authors adopt attention knockouts (Video Temporal, Video Spatial, and Language-to-Video Knockouts) applied across different numbers of layers (global and fine-grained settings).

Result: Key findings include a two-stage processing system in Video-LLMs, intermediate layers' outsized impact, and preference for language-guided retrieval over self-attention among video tokens.

Conclusion: This research reveals how Video-LLMs process video content internally, providing insights into interpretability and computational efficiency for future advancements in Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges of overfitting and high computational cost associated with traditional fine-tuning in transfer learning.

Method: BioTune employs an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique, selectively identifying key layers for modification in pre-trained models.

Result: Evaluation reveals BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency across nine diverse image classification datasets.

Conclusion: By focusing only on relevant layers, BioTune enhances transfer learning efficiency and reduces the computational burden, making it suitable for varied data distributions.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting compression for archival use, enabling storage-efficient solutions in kilobyte range while retaining visual quality and adaptability for post-archival scene changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting compression methods are impractical for large-scale scenes due to insufficient compression efficiency and lack of support for scene changes after archival.

Method: The ICGS-Quantizer improves compression by leveraging inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations, uses shared codebooks across training scenes, and enables adaptability by conditioning scene decoding on images captured during decoding.

Result: ICGS-Quantizer significantly reduces storage needs to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity and improving adaptability to scene changes, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The ICGS-Quantizer shows potential for practical 3D scene archival and updating, offering state-of-the-art compression and adaptability benefits.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveSplat presents an innovative approach to high-quality 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios, utilizing neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling and a voxel initialization scheme to address motion blur and geometric accuracy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in 3D scene reconstruction in driving environments, such as motion blur from dynamic actors and lack of accurate representation of static backgrounds.

Method: DriveSplat employs dynamic-static decoupling, region-wise voxel initialization, and deformable neural Gaussians governed by a learnable deformation network. Depth and normal priors are used to supervise and refine geometric accuracy.

Result: Evaluated on Waymo and KITTI datasets, DriveSplat achieved state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveSplat enhances robustness and geometric accuracy in 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenarios, offering a significant improvement over previous methods.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on tackling the abstract reasoning bottleneck of deep learning models by using Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs) and introduces strategic improvements to the DIO baseline model to overcome limitations in mutual information optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with abstract reasoning, and RPM problems serve as a benchmark for testing this intelligence dimension. The paper aims to improve machine reasoning capabilities in abstract tasks by addressing the flaws in prevailing models.

Method: The paper analyzes RPM tasks through a causal chain modeling approach and designs the DIO model. It identifies shortcomings in leveraging mutual information optimization and proposes three improvements to refine the method.

Result: Experimental analysis highlighted the failure of the DIO model in adequately learning human reasoning logic due to issues with mutual information estimation and causality representation.

Conclusion: By proposing three advanced methods, the paper contributes to bridging the gap in machine intelligence concerning abstract reasoning and highlights the need for causality-oriented model designs.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network for video summarization, addressing issues in temporal dependencies and semantic coherence, and enhancing feature fusion through variational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to better summarize short video content by addressing deficiencies in existing methods, such as ineffective global temporal dependency modeling, semantic coherence loss, and noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: The proposed method involves a keyframe extractor based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for adaptable video frame reasoning, and a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module to mitigate uncertainty and noise using Evidence Lower Bound Optimization (ELBO).

Result: Experimentally, SpiVG outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on datasets like SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS, affirming its efficacy in video summarization tasks.

Conclusion: SpiVG efficiently enhances video summarization with reduced computational complexity and improved semantic coherence, showcasing reliable performance on diverse datasets.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

### [132] [From Linearity to Non-Linearity: How Masked Autoencoders Capture Spatial Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15404)
*Anthony Bisulco,Rahul Ramesh,Randall Balestriero,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn spatial correlations in datasets, analyzing hyperparameters like masking ratio and patch size for optimal feature extraction and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAEs require meticulous hyperparameter tuning when applied to new datasets, but the connection between MAE hyperparameters and downstream performance has not been rigorously studied.

Method: The study employs analytical derivation to understand features in linear MAEs and extends this analysis to non-linear MAEs to examine spatial correlation adaptation, providing practical insights for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: It demonstrates how masking ratios and patch sizes affect the capture of short- and long-range spatial correlations and shows that non-linear MAE representations adapt beyond second-order statistics.

Conclusion: Insights are provided for effective selection of MAE hyperparameters, improving their application and performance on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

### [133] [Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415)
*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BIRD, a method for detecting moving small infrared targets using bidirectional temporal propagation. BIRD achieves state-of-the-art performance by fusing local and global temporal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for infrared small target detection use sliding windows that fail to consider global temporal information and joint optimization of whole video clips, leading to sub-optimal performance.

Method: BIRD uses a bidirectional propagation strategy with two modules: Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) for local dependencies and Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) for global context. These features are combined and optimized with traditional detection loss and Spatio-Temporal Fusion loss.

Result: BIRD achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and fast inference speed, as verified by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed BIRD method enhances small infrared target detection by integrating both local and global temporal information in a unified, efficient framework.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

*Ahmet Can ÃmercikoÄlu,Mustafa Mansur YÃ¶nÃ¼gÃ¼l,Pakize ErdoÄmuÅ*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of image resolution on the performance of three face detection models: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN, using the WIDER FACE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in face detection caused by low-resolution imagery and evaluate the performance of deep learning face detection models under varying resolutions.

Method: The study systematically tests YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN on different resolutions (160x160, 320x320, 640x640) using metrics like precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time.

Result: YOLOv11 achieves the best detection accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 shows better recall, and MTCNN is competitive in landmark localization but slower in real-time inference.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into choosing appropriate face detection models based on operational demands and resolution constraints.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

*Danish Zia Baig,Mohsin Kamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a YOLOv8-based deep learning solution to automate detection of tiny dents on car exteriors, outperforming manual inspection methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies of manual car damage inspections, which are labor-intensive and fail to consistently detect microscopic dents on surfaces.

Method: The authors created a bespoke annotated dataset for car surfaces and trained YOLOv8 variants using real-time data augmentation techniques for robust and accurate detection.

Result: The YOLOv8m-t42 model demonstrated superior detection performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and PR curve area compared to other model variants, justifying its use for accurate dent detection.

Conclusion: YOLOv8m-t42 offers a reliable solution for automated, microscopic dent detection in cars, suitable for real-world applications like insurance evaluations and vehicle inspections.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

*Yogesh Kumar,Uday Agarwal,Manish Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATR, a transformer-based model tailored for video-to-video moment retrieval, achieving notable performance gains with a novel self-supervised pre-training technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the challenges of accurately localizing moments in a target video using a query video, such as semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex correlations between videos.

Method: The research presents MATR, which uses dual-stage sequence alignment and transformer-based encoding for semantic and temporal context. It also introduces a self-supervised pre-training method to enhance task-specific initialization.

Result: MATR shows significant improvements in performance metrics (R@1, mIoU) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with gains of 13.1% and 8.1% on ActivityNet-VRL and even higher gains on the authors' newly proposed SportsMoments dataset.

Conclusion: MATR effectively addresses Vid2VidMR challenges and sets a new benchmark by leveraging advanced alignment techniques and self-supervised pre-training.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

### [137] [Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from extremely sparse views with SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15457)
*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method that eliminates the need for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for novel view synthesis under extremely sparse input views. The proposed system enhances both camera pose estimation and 3D scene reconstruction while overcoming limitations due to sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques rely heavily on dense, multi-view inputs with precise camera poses, which are uncommon in real-world settings, and struggle under extremely sparse input conditions due to the failure of the SfM initialization process.

Method: The method replaces SfM with a dense stereo module that progressively estimates camera poses and constructs a global dense point cloud. It incorporates a view interpolation module for augmenting training supervision in sparse-view settings, alongside multi-scale Laplacian and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale regularization techniques for improved geometric and visual quality.

Result: The proposed approach achieved a 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions (2 training views) compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS methods. Synthesized images exhibit minimal distortion and retain high-frequency details for superior visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed SfM-free 3DGS-based method offers a significant advancement in novel view synthesis, particularly in extreme sparse-view scenarios, delivering superior reconstruction quality and reducing reliance on precise camera pose information.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

*Chengqi Dong,Fenghe Tang,Rongge Mao,Xinpei Gao,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LGMSNet, a novel lightweight framework for medical image segmentation with superior performance and minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for lightweight and generalizable medical image segmentation models in resource-constrained clinical settings.

Method: Introduction of LGMSNet, which uses heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to reduce channel redundancy and sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture global information.

Result: LGMSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates strong generalization in zero-shot tests on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: LGMSNet has significant potential for deployment in real-world, resource-constrained medical environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MExECON is a new pipeline for creating 3D avatars from sparse RGB images, improving over single-view methods by optimizing a body model across multiple views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-view approaches like ECON fail to fully leverage multi-view advantages for accurate geometry and pose estimation in 3D human reconstruction.

Method: The JMBO algorithm is introduced to jointly optimize a single SMPL-X body model across multiple views, providing multi-view consistency before adding surface details with normal maps.

Result: MExECON demonstrates improved fidelity over ECON and performs competitively against state-of-the-art few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MExECON enhances 3D reconstruction of clothed avatars by integrating multi-view data without requiring additional network training, capturing detailed surface features effectively.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for multimodal image fusion that overcomes misalignment and detail loss challenges using adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal image fusion is essential for improving image quality and enabling applications like medical diagnostics and remote sensing. Challenges such as modality misalignment and detail loss hinder current methods.

Method: The authors propose AdaSFFuse, featuring Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient cross-domain fusion.

Result: Experiments across four fusion tasks demonstrate superior performance in preserving details and aligning features at a low computational cost.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse provides a robust and efficient solution for multimodal image fusion with publicly-available code, balancing performance and efficiency across tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExtraGS, a framework that improves trajectory extrapolation for driving scene simulation. It combines geometric and generative priors for better realism and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating driving scenes, particularly extrapolating views from driving logs, is important for autonomous vehicles but faces challenges like poor geometric consistency and rendering artifacts.

Method: ExtraGS employs a Road Surface Gaussian representation using a hybrid Gaussian-SDF design and Far Field Gaussians to handle distant objects effectively. It also incorporates a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework to selectively utilize generative priors.

Result: Experiments across different datasets and setups show that ExtraGS enhances view realism and geometric consistency while maintaining high fidelity on the original trajectory.

Conclusion: ExtraGS offers a robust method for synthesizing extrapolated views with improved performance, addressing key challenges in trajectory extrapolation for driving scenes.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

*Guotao Liang,Juncheng Hu,Ximing Xing,Jing Zhang,Qian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method, GroupSketch, is proposed for animating vector sketches with multiple interacting objects and complex motions, outperforming existing methods in quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector sketch animation methods are limited in handling multi-object interactions and complex motions effectively, often suffering from issues like temporal inconsistency and poor generalization.

Method: GroupSketch uses a two-stage pipeline: Motion Initialization, where the sketch is divided into semantic groups with keyframes for coarse animation, and Motion Refinement, where a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) predicts group-specific displacement fields to refine the animation.

Result: GroupSketch demonstrates superior performance in generating high-quality, temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object vector sketches compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GroupSketch expands the practical applications of sketch animation by addressing key limitations in existing methods, particularly for multi-object and complex-motion scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet, a novel model using attention and dual-stream mechanisms, excels at extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing images, solving issues like occlusions and fragmented topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow roads in high-resolution remote sensing imagery are difficult to extract due to their limited width, fragmented structure, and frequent occlusions.

Method: The paper introduces D3FNet, featuring the DADE module for enhancing road features, the DDFM for integrating spatial and semantic data, and a multi-scale dilation strategy to improve narrow road continuity.

Result: D3FNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in IoU and recall metrics on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks, showing superior results for occluded and low-contrast road features.

Conclusion: D3FNet provides an effective solution to extract fine-grained narrow roads in challenging remote sensing scenarios, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADAPT, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) method that bypasses backpropagation and models class-conditional feature distributions for improved scalability, robustness, and calibrated predictions under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of current TTA methods, which rely on backpropagation, lack scalability for real-time deployment, and fail to model class-conditional feature distributions for reliable decision boundaries.

Method: ADAPT reformulates TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task using gradually updated class means and shared covariance matrices. It introduces lightweight regularization using CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank to correct likelihood bias.

Result: ADAPT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, highlighting its scalability, robustness, and effectiveness under various distribution shifts.

Conclusion: ADAPT offers a scalable, robust, and training-free approach to TTA that does not require source data, gradient updates, or full access to target data, making it suitable for online and transductive settings.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to mitigate the spectral bias in INRs, which limits their ability to capture sharp edges and fine textures due to favoring low-frequency components.

Method: The proposed method employs a two-stage training: initially using a neighbor-aware soft mask to prioritize high-frequency details followed by full-image training.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal significant improvements in reconstruction quality, highlighting compatibility with other existing INR approaches.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues by introducing frequency-aware pixel importance within INRs, effectively addressing spectral bias and enhancing image reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

### [146] [Fast globally optimal Truncated Least Squares point cloud registration with fixed rotation axis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15613)
*Ivo Ivanov,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves point cloud registration robustness to outlier rates of 95% using a novel convex relaxation method and contractor technique, achieving faster results compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing methods in solving the truncated least squares (TLS) point cloud registration problem, specifically with high outlier rates, and the slow performance of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation methods.

Method: The authors propose a novel linear-time convex relaxation method and a contractor method to accelerate Branch and Bound (BnB) processes for solving the TLS problem.

Result: The proposed approach can globally optimally register 3D point clouds (100 points) in under half a second for rotation-only problems, outperforming the state-of-the-art SDP solver (STRIDE) by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates both theoretical and empirical global optimality in efficiently solving the rotation-only TLS point cloud registration problem, though it cannot yet handle full 6DoF problems.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

TL;DR: This study utilized camera traps and drone imagery to examine wildlife and human activity patterns in Chitwan National Park, detecting hotspots of overlap and potential human-wildlife conflicts using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to improve understanding of the spatial patterns of wildlife and human activities to better evaluate human-wildlife interactions and improve conservation efforts.

Method: Camera traps and drone-collected thermal imagery were analyzed, employing deep learning models such as YOLOv11s and Faster RCNN for object detection. Spatial patterns were studied to identify hotspots and conflict zones.

Result: YOLOv11s achieved the best performance with high precision (96.2%) and recall (92.3%). Spatial analysis revealed overlapping activity hotspots in CNP, marking potential areas of human-wildlife conflict.

Conclusion: Multiperspective monitoring and automated detection effectively reveal human-wildlife interactions, aiding in the management of conservation landscapes and reducing conflicts.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM tailored for precise temporal and entity-aware video reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve video understanding by addressing limitations in temporal perceptiveness and entity alignment in current Video LLMs.

Method: Incorporates a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder for better boundary sensitivity, uses object-grounded representations for stronger alignment, and applies a mixed token scheme for explicit timestamp modeling.

Result: Grounded VideoDiT outperforms existing models in state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including Charades STA, NExT GQA, and VideoQA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations enable more precise and robust video reasoning, advancing the field of Video LLMs.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

*Swann Emilien CÃ©leste Destouches,Jesse Lahaye,Laurent Valentin Jospin,Jan Skaloud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised approach to improve tree instance segmentation in ALS data by leveraging human quality ratings for training a rating model that refines segmentation outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of tree instances in ALS data is critical for forest monitoring but is challenging due to variability in data and the high cost of acquiring labeled datasets.

Method: The approach involves using human-operated quality ratings from initial segmentation results to train a rating model. This model then provides feedback to finetune the segmentation model.

Result: The proposed method improved the correct identification of tree instances by 34% while significantly reducing non-tree instances. However, performance issues remain in sparsely forested regions with small trees or complex surroundings.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances tree instance segmentation in ALS data but still faces limitations in certain challenging environments.

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

### [150] [Towards a 3D Transfer-based Black-box Attack via Critical Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15650)
*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CFG, a black-box transfer attack method for 3D neural networks, focusing on critical feature guidance to improve attack transferability while maintaining imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D adversarial attack methods rely on knowledge of target models, which is unrealistic in highly secure, real-world conditions.

Method: The paper introduces Critical Feature Guidance (CFG), which prioritizes corrupting critical features to enhance transferability of adversarial point clouds, and adds constraints to ensure attacks remain imperceptible.

Result: Experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show that CFG achieves significantly higher performance compared to state-of-the-art transfer-based attack methods.

Conclusion: CFG demonstrates the effectiveness of exploiting consistent critical features across DNN architectures for improved transferability in black-box attack scenarios, while generating imperceptible adversarial point clouds.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

*Ziyang Yan,Ruikai Li,Zhiyong Cui,Bohan Li,Han Jiang,Yilong Ren,Aoyong Li,Zhenning Li,Sijia Wen,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapKD addresses the inefficiencies of current HD map construction models for autonomous driving by using a novel Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS) knowledge distillation framework to enhance lightweight vision-centric models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to overcome reliance on stale offline maps and computationally expensive multi-modal sensor setups for real-time HD map construction in autonomous driving.

Method: MapKD introduces a Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS) paradigm, combining a multi-modal teacher model, vision-centric coach model, and lightweight student model. It uses innovative techniques like Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation (TGPD) and Masked Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) to transfer knowledge effectively.

Result: Experimental results show MapKD improves the vision-based student model's performance by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP on the nuScenes dataset, accompanied by faster inference speeds.

Conclusion: MapKD offers an efficient and practical solution for HD map construction in autonomous driving, eliminating dependence on costly and outdated methods while achieving better performance and speed.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents CM2LoD3, a novel method for automating the creation of Level of Detail 3 (LoD3) 3D building models, essential for applications like urban planning and disaster management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and scalable generation of LoD3 building models, which include detailed facade elements such as windows and doors, as traditional manual methods make large-scale adoption impractical.

Method: The method utilizes Conflict Maps (CMs) derived from advanced ray-to-model-prior analysis. Additionally, the approach incorporates semantically segmenting real-world and synthetic CMs and fuses segmentation from textured models using confidence scores.

Result: The proposed CM2LoD3 method achieves 61% performance in uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures, proving effective in segmenting and reconstructing building openings.

Conclusion: CM2LoD3 advances automated LoD3 model reconstruction, enabling scalable and efficient 3D city modeling, and contributes significantly to the field of urban data analysis through its novel approach.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

*Yongju Jia,Jiarui Ma,Xiangxian Li,Baiqiao Zhang,Xianhui Cao,Juan Liu,Yulong Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework for fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) under class-imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the bias and performance degradation caused by class imbalance in standard VLM fine-tuning and the accumulation of bias from pre-training.

Method: The MDPR framework establishes a five-dimensional visual-semantic knowledge base and incorporates a dynamic routing mechanism to align, retrieve, and balance semantics during fine-tuning.

Result: MDPR delivers state-of-the-art performance across long-tailed benchmarks like CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: MDPR offers an effective, flexible, and computationally efficient method for enhancing fine-tuning of VLMs in class-imbalanced scenarios, emphasizing tail class improvements.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose StreamMem, a memory-efficient mechanism that allows multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to handle long videos by compressing key-value (KV) cache in a query-agnostic, streaming manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficient handling of long video contexts by MLLMs, which face challenges like high memory and computational demands for storing and processing the entire visual KV cache.

Method: Introduces StreamMem, a KV cache memory mechanism that compresses visual context incrementally. It employs attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens to maintain a fixed-size KV memory suitable for long-video and streaming QA.

Result: StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and performs competitively with other query-aware methods in long and streaming video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The StreamMem method advances the efficient comprehension of long videos by maintaining a balance between memory constraints and accuracy, showing its robustness in both query-agnostic and streaming environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

TL;DR: WorldWeaver improves long video generative modeling by enhancing temporal consistency and motion dynamics using joint RGB and perceptual condition modeling, depth cues, and noise scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video modeling methods struggle with maintaining structural and temporal consistency over long durations due to reliance on RGB signals.

Method: WorldWeaver introduces joint modeling of RGB frames and perceptual conditions, depth-based memory bank, and segmented noise scheduling to enhance long-horizon video generation.

Result: WorldWeaver reduces temporal drift and enhances video generation quality, as confirmed by experiments with diffusion- and rectified flow-based models.

Conclusion: WorldWeaver offers significant improvement in generative video modeling, addressing challenges of drift and ensuring higher video fidelity over extended durations.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

TL;DR: The paper presents the All-in-SAM Model, which improves nuclei segmentation using vision foundation models with minimal annotation effort and focuses on enhanced fine-grained semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges general vision models face with fine-grained semantic segmentation, particularly for specific nuclei subtypes or cells, using computational pathology advancements.

Method: A molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model is developed with three focuses: engaging lay annotators for molecular-empowered learning, adapting the SAM model with a SAM adapter for specific semantics, and refining segmentation using Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL).

Result: Experimental results showed significant improvements in cell classification performance using both in-house and public datasets, even with varied annotation quality.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotator workload, makes precise biomedical image analysis more accessible for resource-limited settings, and advances medical diagnostics and pathology automation.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-performance foundation model that unifies image and video generation and overcomes existing limitations in quality and consistency.

Method: The authors introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture for better modality alignment, a data curation pipeline for high-quality training data, and detailed training/inference recipes.

Result: Waver generates videos with complex motion and high temporal consistency, achieves Top 3 rankings on T2V and I2V leaderboards, and matches or surpasses leading commercial solutions.

Conclusion: Waver establishes itself as a benchmark in video generation, supporting efficient community progress with its contributions in training and technology.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATLAS is a high-fidelity body model derived from 600K scans, addressing limitations in existing human mesh modeling approaches by decoupling skeleton and shape representations to improve pose, shape, and skeletal control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing body modeling methods struggle with limited data diversity and restricted modeling assumptions, resulting in challenges capturing diverse human poses and shapes. The dependency between internal skeleton and external soft tissues in existing linear models also limits control over attributes like body height and bone lengths.

Method: ATLAS was developed using 600K high-resolution scans captured from 240 synchronized cameras. It decouples the shape representation from the skeleton by grounding the body mesh representation in the skeleton, employs non-linear pose correctives, and allows fine-grained customization of body parameters.

Result: ATLAS achieves more accurate fits for unseen subjects in diverse poses compared to previous methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that its non-linear pose correctives effectively model complex poses better than linear models.

Conclusion: The decoupled shape and skeleton structure of ATLAS enhances shape expressivity, improves customization, and enables better fitting, effectively addressing limitations in existing body modeling techniques.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Motivation: To address the growing need for efficient and high-quality 3D content generation for applications in VR/AR and embodied AI.

Method: The proposal of SceneGen, a framework that uses a feature aggregation module to integrate visual and geometric data for generating 3D assets and spatial positions in a single feedforward pass.

Result: SceneGen demonstrates robust and efficient generation capabilities for both single-image and multi-image inputs, validated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: SceneGen offers a novel approach for scalable, high-quality 3D content generation and shows promise for practical applications in downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

### [160] [Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15772)
*Qingyang Mao,Qi Cai,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Ting Yao,Qi Liu,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAREdit, a visual autoregressive framework for instruction-guided image editing, overcoming limitations of diffusion models by using a next-scale prediction approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face challenges in keeping edited regions isolated from unintended modifications, prompting the search for more precise and efficient image editing techniques.

Method: The authors propose VAREdit, which uses a next-scale prediction mechanism with a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module to align source and target features for precise image editing.

Result: VAREdit achieves significant improvements in both adherence to editing instructions and efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based methods by 30%+ in GPT-Balance score and is 2.2 times faster than UltraEdit.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of autoregressive approaches for instruction-guided image editing, offering precise modifications, better adherence to instructions, and improved efficiency compared to leading diffusion-based models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

### [161] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable inference method to improve the diversity and quality of generated image or video outputs as cohesive groups, addressing limitations in redundancy during independent sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve diversity and quality in groups of multiple generated outputs presented to users, avoiding redundancy and enabling better idea exploration.

Method: Group inference is modeled as a quadratic integer assignment problem that balances sample quality and group diversity. A progressive pruning strategy is used to enhance runtime efficiency.

Result: The method significantly enhances group diversity and quality over independent sampling and recent algorithms across tasks like text-to-image, image-to-image, and video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework allows generative models to treat outputs as unified groups, ensuring scalability and improved user experience through diverse and high-quality results.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [162] [CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15774)
*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CineScale, a novel inference technique for generating high-resolution visual content, overcoming limitations in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual diffusion models struggle to produce high-quality high-resolution content due to limited training resolutions and computational constraints.

Method: CineScale leverages tailored inference paradigms and architectural variants to enhance high-resolution image and video generation, using open-source frameworks and minimal fine-tuning.

Result: CineScale enables generation of 8k images and 4k videos with minimal tuning, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CineScale broadens the scope of high-resolution visual generation across multiple modalities, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable high-resolution output.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 'Declarative Data Pipeline' architecture tailored for scalable and maintainable machine learning integration in distributed data systems, showing significant boosts in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data systems often struggle with performance, maintainability, and team productivity, especially when incorporating ML at scale in collaborative environments.

Method: The paper proposes a modular architecture using 'Pipes' within Apache Spark to clearly define components, standardize interfaces, and move away from microservice-based designs.

Result: Demonstrated a 50% improvement in development efficiency, 500x scalability performance gains, and 10x throughput in enterprise settings, alongside significant academic experimental gains.

Conclusion: The architecture bridges the gap between high system performance and maintainability, offering a framework for scalable and efficient data processing with substantial gains in productivity and system optimization.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt, a state management framework for serverless workflows, addresses latency and inefficiency challenges in dynamic environments like the 3D Compute Continuum, achieving reduced execution times and improved throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless functions in dynamic environments face high latency and inefficiency due to reliance on remote storage, network topology changes, and data transfer overhead, particularly in the 3D Compute Continuum.

Method: Databelt introduces SLO-aware state propagation, proactively offloading function states to suitable nodes, and a state fusion mechanism to optimize serverless runtime sharing and minimize redundant operations.

Result: Databelt reduces workflow execution time by up to 66%, increases throughput by 50%, and cuts storage operations latency by up to 20% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Databelt ensures efficient state management for serverless workflows in dynamic, high-latency environments, optimizing network and storage interactions for increased performance and reduced latency.

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

*Caterina Feletti,Paola Flocchini,Debasish Pattanayak,Giuseppe Prencipe,Nicola Santoro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Autonomous Dancing problem for robot swarms, proposing a solution under the LUMI model using sequential scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address constraints in solving the dancing problem for mobile robots, such as restrictions on configurations or choreographies, by introducing a new approach.

Method: The authors use the LUMI model, a sequential scheduler, and a distributed counter mechanism to enable robots to execute periodic or finite choreographies.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the Universal Dancing problem is solvable under the LUMI model with feasibility constraints related to the robot's available color palette.

Conclusion: The paper extends the boundaries of choreography formation by robot swarms and ensures spatial homogeneity even with non-rigid movements through their proposed method.

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

TL;DR: The paper presents advanced mixed-precision inference techniques improving memory, efficiency, and computational speed for Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory and computational demands of LLMs by exploring new mixed-precision techniques and optimizing hardware utilization.

Method: Introduces mixed-precision pipelines focused on GEMM and attention computation optimization, leveraging hardware-specific methods like weight packing and KV memory loading.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in serving latency (up to 61% reduction) and throughput (up to 156% increase) across 16 LLMs and 4 GPU architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed methods consistently enhance LLM inference efficiency, validated through comprehensive testing, and are integrated into the TurboMind engine within the open-source LMDeploy project.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a

*Pierre Fraigniaud,Minh Hang Nguyen,Ami Paz,Ulrich Schmid,Hugo Rincon Galeana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a generalized lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous systems with arbitrary communication networks, extending previous work and introducing a topological proof method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to generalize and strengthen lower bounds for k-set agreement in synchronous networks beyond complete networks and undirected networks.

Method: The method involves a topological proof using shellable carrier maps, Sperner's lemma, and Kuhn triangulations to analyze the evolution and connectivity of protocol complexes under crashes.

Result: The paper achieves a generalized lower bound for k-set agreement, introduces a simpler proof for systems with initial crashes, and reduces the input complexity using Kuhn triangulations.

Conclusion: The research significantly extends prior bounds and methods by presenting a topological approach applicable to diverse network structures, providing insights into agreement problems under arbitrary conditions.

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CausalMesh introduces a caching solution for serverless workflows addressing anomalies from computation migrations across different nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face anomalies in serverless workflows due to migratory computation and inconsistent caching across nodes.

Method: CausalMesh enables coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations, with formal verification done in Dafny.

Result: Experiments show improved latency and throughput compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: CausalMesh effectively achieves transactional causal consistency in serverless environments while mitigating anomalies in node migrations.

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning framework that incorporates ethical considerations for autonomous vehicles, improving navigation in complex traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles require ethical reasoning in their maneuvers to minimize traffic fatalities and ensure responsible decision-making in diverse and unpredictable situations.

Method: The paper introduces a Safe RL framework that uses a composite ethical risk cost for decision-making and combines dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay with polynomial path planning and control systems to execute smooth, ethical trajectories.

Result: Testing on real-world traffic datasets demonstrated that their approach outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risks and maintaining optimal driving performance.

Conclusion: Integrating reinforcement learning with formal control theories can enable ethically-accountable autonomous driving in mixed traffic environments, advancing safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction is challenging due to variability across patient populations and no single model performing best across all cohorts.

Method: The proposed method combines cohort retrieval via FAISS similarity search and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning to dynamically choose the appropriate algorithm from a selection of eight models. Input includes patient CT scans and structured metadata.

Result: The two-stage pipeline enables personalized, cohort-aware risk predictions, adapting to patient demographics and clinical features effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a flexible and practical solution for individualized lung cancer risk assessment in diverse and real-world clinical settings, leveraging modern retrieval and reasoning techniques.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

*Anurag Tripathi,Ajeet Kumar Singh,Rajsabi Surya,Aum Gupta,Sahiinii Lemaina Veikho,Dorien Herremans,Sudhir Bisane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HHNAS-AM, a hierarchical approach to NAS in text classification, yielding an 8% improvement in test accuracy on the Spider dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing NAS models for text classification, which struggle with redundant and large search spaces due to unrestricted architectures.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical hybrid NAS with adaptive mutation policies (HHNAS-AM), featuring structured search spaces based on domain-specific cues, and employing Q-learning for dynamic mutation adaptation.

Result: The HHNAS-AM consistently finds high-performing architectures and improves test accuracy by 8% on the Spider dataset compared to baselines.

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM efficiently explores structured search spaces, leveraging adaptive mutation, and proves effective in performance improvement for text classification tasks.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO (Linear Preference Optimization) replaces DPO to solve overfitting and collapse issues using innovative loss functions, stability constraints, and controllable rejection suppression that enhance performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome limitations like overfitting and collapse in widely-used DPO for preference optimization.

Method: Introducing LPO with gradient decoupling (absolute difference loss), offset constraints and regularization, and tunable rejection suppression techniques.

Result: LPO shows consistent improvement on text, math, and TTS tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility.

Conclusion: LPO emerges as a robust and tunable framework for preference optimization, with source code and data publicly available.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads revolutionizes online ad recommendation by transferring not just user representations, but also item and user-item cross representations, while using innovative multi-granularity techniques for better upstream-downstream alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing ad recommendation models, which rely only on user representations and ignore item and cross representations, while also failing to bridge gaps between upstream models and downstream tasks.

Method: The proposed framework, LFM4Ads, transfers all representations (URs, IRs, and CRs) and employs multi-granularity mechanisms, including non-linear adapters, Isomorphic Interaction Modules, and Standalone Retrieval, for comprehensive scalability and efficiency.

Result: Successfully deployed in Tencent's advertising platform, LFM4Ads processes tens of billions of samples daily and achieves a 2.45% GMV lift across different ad scenarios, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in estimated annual revenue increases.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads demonstrates the potential of leveraging comprehensive representation transfer with multi-granularity mechanisms to enhance both accuracy and scalability in online ad recommendations.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

*Sami Alabed,Dominik Grewe,Norman Alexander Rink,Timur Sitdikov,Agnieszka Swietlik,Dimitrios Vytiniotis,Daniel Belov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system that uses static compiler analysis combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerators, dramatically improving performance and feasibility compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in partitioning large machine learning models arise due to complicated, interdependent decisions and ambiguities in sharding, causing inefficiencies like out-of-memory errors or slow exploration in auto-partitioners.

Method: The proposed system integrates static compiler analysis to identify crucial sharding dimensions and resolve conflicts, alongside Monte Carlo Tree Search for efficient exploration in the decision space.

Result: The system achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art industrial methods, discovering better partitions on a variety of hardware platforms and model architectures, fully automating the process for large models.

Conclusion: The approach presents an automated, efficient, and scalable solution to partitioning large machine learning models, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

### [178] [CuMoLoS-MAE: A Masked Autoencoder for Remote Sensing Data Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14957)
*Anurup Naskar,Nathanael Zhixin Wong,Sara Shamekh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CuMoLoS-MAE, a deep learning model for reconstructing accurate atmospheric profiles, including uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing atmospheric profile reconstruction techniques suffer from noise, range folding, and discontinuities, while traditional models blur details and deep models lack confidence estimates.

Method: The model employs Curriculum-Guided Masked Autoencoding and Monte Carlo stochastic ensemble sampling to restore fine-scale features, learn data-driven atmospheric priors, and quantify pixel-wise uncertainty.

Result: CuMoLoS-MAE provides high-fidelity reconstructions, fine-scale atmospheric diagnostics, pixel-wise uncertainty maps, and supports applications like real-time assimilation and long-term climate reanalysis.

Conclusion: This approach improves atmospheric profile reconstruction accuracy and reliability, enabling advanced diagnostics and data integration for weather and climate studies.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

### [179] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) integrates uncertainty estimation into gradient descent optimization by training two identical models on independent bootstrap samples and refining their learning trajectories periodically, improving calibration and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of confidence measures in standard gradient descent methods, especially in overparameterized and low-data regimes where models often overfit.

Method: Twin-Boot maintains two identical models trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, periodically resetting their mean weights to ensure their trajectories remain in the same basin, allowing divergence to signal within-basin uncertainty.

Result: The approach enhances calibration, generalization, and produces interpretable uncertainty maps for deep neural networks and high-dimensional inverse problems.

Conclusion: Twin-Boot provides integrated uncertainty estimation and adaptive regularization for deep learning, overcoming bootstrapping challenges in non-convex optimization landscapes.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome vulnerabilities in traditional CAPTCHA systems increasingly exploited by AI-driven methods, ensuring secure and scalable online protection.

Method: Aura-CAPTCHA utilizes GANs for dynamic image challenges, RL for adjusting difficulty, and LLMs for generating diverse text and audio prompts, combining multi-modal inputs.

Result: The system achieved a 92% success rate for humans and a 10% bypass rate for bots, outperforming other CAPTCHA systems in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: Aura-CAPTCHA offers an advanced, scalable, and user-friendly solution to secure online platforms against AI-driven threats, addressing limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible
to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.

*Saar Tzour-Shaday,Dana Drachsler Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BaVerLy, a novel verifier that improves the efficiency of local robustness verification by assessing groups of similar inputs together, reducing verification time by up to 4.1x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network image classifiers are widely used in safety-critical applications, but their susceptibility to adversarial attacks poses a major challenge. Existing local robustness verifiers either take too long or lack precision, limiting their utility for large input sets.

Method: The authors propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete verification framework that groups similar $
$-balls into mini-batches for joint verification. It dynamically adapts batch sizes and leverages partial analysis results to guide refinement and expedite analysis of problematic inputs.

Result: BaVerLy demonstrates a speedup in local robustness verification processes, achieving a 2.3x efficiency improvement on average (up to 4.1x in some cases) while being evaluated on fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The group local robustness verification strategy of BaVerLy enables scalable and efficient analysis of neural networks' robustness while maintaining both soundness and completeness.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, proposing minimax rates and findings suggesting optimal estimators should discard highly corrupted samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing robust estimators that ignore structural heterogeneity in corruption rates.

Method: The paper derives tight minimax rates for heterogeneous corruption patterns in various estimation problems, such as mean and regression.

Result: It establishes the minimax rates for all scenarios and suggests optimal estimators discard samples with corruption beyond a certain threshold.

Conclusion: The paper advances robust estimation methods, considering heterogeneous corruptions and providing theoretical summaries for optimal estimators.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: The paper proves that generative equilibrium operators (GEOs), a class of neural operators, can approximate optimization solutions with parameter scaling logarithmically with desired precision and validates this on three applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators have a gap between theoretical parameter bounds and practical efficiency seen in experiments, necessitating an explanation for their performance in operator learning.

Method: The paper introduces generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) using finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers to solve convex optimization problems over separable Hilbert spaces.

Result: GEOs are shown to uniformly approximate solutions on infinite-dimensional compact sets with logarithmic parameter scaling based on precision. Validation is performed on nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control, and finance hedging under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: The research bridges theoretical and practical gaps in neural operators by introducing GEOs, demonstrating scalable approximation capabilities and practical feasibility in diverse applications.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer that improves robustness and stability in hyperparameter selection, particularly step-size, without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning optimizers often require precise hyperparameter tuning for effective performance, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This paper aims to address the issue by improving the stability of step-size hyperparameter choices.

Method: The paper adapts the NGN step-size method to incorporate momentum, creating NGN-M. It achieves convergence rates under less restrictive assumptions by removing constraints like interpolation conditions or bounded gradients.

Result: NGN-M achieves comparable or superior performance against state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly enhancing robustness to step-size hyperparameter selection.

Conclusion: NGN-M presents a practical and robust alternative in optimization algorithms for deep learning, streamlining hyperparameter tuning and maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hydra, a novel architecture for hybrid long-context language models, combining several advanced techniques for efficient computation and memory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create modular, input-adaptive long-context language models that address existing challenges like computation efficiency, contextual memory handling, and expert specialization.

Method: Hydra employs a structured state space model (SSM) backbone, sparse global attention, chunk-level mixture-of-experts (MoE) feed-forward routing, and dual memory systems.

Result: Initial toy-scale prototype experiments show implementation feasibility, scalability behaviors, and controllable routing dynamics, without demonstrating competitive performance at full scale.

Conclusion: Hydra serves as a blueprint for research on modular language models with long-context capabilities, rather than a finished, validated system.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAL is a novel interpretable graph neural network that explains molecular predictions by attributing them to specific subgraphs, improving both model reliability and human understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of the black-box nature of graph neural networks, which limits their interpretability for critical applications like drug discovery and material design.

Method: SEAL uses a technique that decomposes input molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments and estimates their causal influence. It minimizes inter-fragment message passing in its architecture for better alignment between contributions and predictions.

Result: SEAL demonstrated improved interpretability and attribution accuracy over other techniques on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, and its explanations were rated as more intuitive by domain experts.

Conclusion: SEAL bridges the gap between predictive performance and interpretability in molecular modeling, offering transparent and actionable insights for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: This study addresses federated learning for nonlinear systems, showing improved convergence rates as more clients participate, validated by experiments with physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve convergence rates in the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems while leveraging federated learning approaches, especially in scenarios where data from multiple clients is available.

Method: The paper establishes theoretical guarantees and uses experiments with nonlinear systems, such as pendulum and quadrotor dynamics. It carefully designs feature maps to enhance excitation and uses i.i.d. control inputs and policies for validation.

Result: Federated learning improves the convergence rate across clients compared to centralized methods, with experimental validation showing performance improvements under varying noise levels and data distributions.

Conclusion: Federated learning is effective for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems, particularly as more clients contribute, offering better convergence rates and practical relevance for physical system modeling.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

TL;DR: The paper tackles the computational challenges of deep neural network (DNN) training by developing a novel caching and compression approach that optimizes layer-freezing techniques for reduced training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing computational costs due to larger datasets and DNNs by improving the efficiency of layer-freezing techniques.

Method: Introducing similarity-aware channel augmentation to enhance feature map utilization while minimizing storage costs and combining this with progressive compression strategies to reduce storage overhead as layers are frozen.

Result: The proposed solutions effectively reduce training costs, maintain accuracy, and add minimal time overhead.

Conclusion: The paper provides systematic solutions for improving layer-freezing methods in DNN training and offers practical guidelines for optimizing freezing and compression strategies for computational efficiency.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Elif Konyar,Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach combining multi-task learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition to efficiently model heterogeneous subpopulations, achieving better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling heterogeneous subpopulations due to varying individual characteristics and behaviors.

Method: The approach combines MTL to leverage shared structures among similar tasks and low-rank tensor decomposition to capture commonalities and variations across tasks and subpopulations.

Result: Experimental results showcased improved prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to benchmarks, especially in scenarios with high subpopulation variability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances personalized modeling by efficiently learning individualized models while improving prediction accuracy and uncovering patterns for better interpretability.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

### [190] [Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697)
*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the performance differences between D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), finding limited trainability improvements with QA sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate why D-Wave QA sampling hasn't yielded significant improvements in RBM training and assess its potential for other machine learning applications.

Method: A hybrid sampling approach combining QA and MCMC methods was implemented. Experiments were conducted to test its efficacy in RBM training and catastrophic forgetting mitigation.

Result: No training improvements were achieved for RBMs. However, QA sampling showed potential for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in generative replay applications.

Conclusion: QA sampling differences in lower-probability distributions may still hold potential for future ML applications despite its limited benefit in RBM training.

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines why deep neural networks (DNNs) confidently classify random or unstructured inputs ("fooling examples"), providing a new framework and a solution to prevent degeneracy in overparameterized networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generalization behavior of DNNs, especially why they confidently classify unstructured inputs, and to address issues arising from overparameterization that lead to trivial solutions.

Method: The authors introduce an analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, avoiding standard gradient-based approaches. They analyze DNN behavior in the overparameterized regime and propose a novel "wormhole" solution to address degeneracy.

Result: The study identifies that overparameterized DNNs exhibit output feature space collapse, improving generalization but eventually leading to degeneracy. The wormhole solution bypasses this problem and aligns random and meaningful labels.

Conclusion: The findings deepen understanding of DNN's generalization and offer a new perspective on shortcut learning, suggesting future research directions in unsupervised learning to align theoretical and practical insights.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

### [192] [Evaluating Sparse Autoencoders for Monosemantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15094)
*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in mitigating polysemanticity in large language models, showing they improve concept separability but with trade-offs in sparsity and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting large language models is difficult due to neurons activating for multiple unrelated concepts (polysemanticity). Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are proposed to transform activations into more interpretable features, and the study aims to systematically assess their effectiveness in reducing polysemanticity.

Method: The paper introduces a Jensen-Shannon-based separability score to quantify how neurons' activations distinguish different concepts and evaluates SAEs against base models using neuron masking and suppression interventions. A new method (APP) is proposed for concept-based activation suppression.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and enhance concept separability compared to base models. However, increasing sparsity can impair performance. APP outperforms existing intervention strategies in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs provide a promising avenue for improving interpretability in language models, particularly for concept-level interventions, though careful tuning of sparsity levels is necessary to avoid downstream performance degradation.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

*Shaswati Saha,Sourajit Saha,Manas Gaur,Tejas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) designed to prohibit undesired text-to-image generations can be circumvented, exhibiting side effects that impair robustness and functionality. A benchmark ("Side Effect Evaluation") is proposed to measure these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy, copyright, and safety concerns surrounding text-to-image generative models necessitate the development of effective methods to prevent misuse by erasing specific target concepts.

Method: The researchers proposed using a benchmark called Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) consisting of prompts describing objects and their attributes, along with an evaluation pipeline to measure side effects in CETs (like hierarchy exploitation and attribute leakage).

Result: CETs were found to be vulnerable to circumvention via compositional, hierarchical, and semantically similar prompts. Additional side effects included attribute leakage during generation and changes in visual attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Current CETs are unreliable for robust concept erasure due to circumvention possibilities and unintended consequences. The authors provide tools and benchmarks to guide future improvements in concept erasure.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for efficient zero-shot unlearning in scenarios where the original training data is inaccessible, with robust theoretical guarantees and strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of removing private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models when the original training data is unavailable.

Method: The method estimates the Hessian matrix of the unknown remaining training data, enabling zero-shot unlearning with guarantees on efficiency and performance.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robust unlearning capabilities, retaining performance on remaining data, validated across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed technique offers a practical solution for source-free unlearning, balancing privacy needs and model integrity effectively.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper defines a universal reinforcement learning (URL) framework based on advanced mathematical abstractions, discussing its application in asynchronous parallel distributed computation and dynamic system models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks using categorial and mathematical abstractions to enable a unified understanding and analysis of dynamic system models in a parallel distributed manner.

Method: The authors review basic RL, employ categories and functors, introduce asynchronous distributed minimization, and generalize fixed-point problems to universal coalgebras.

Result: The space of MDP and PSR algorithms is modeled as a functor category within a topos structure. Various dynamic system models are unified under universal coalgebras, and action value determination is generalized to finding final coalgebras asynchronously.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to theoretical RL by proposing a categorial generalization, offering insights into asynchronous distributed operations and presenting a unified model for dynamic systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Motivation: To address the lack of consensus on the effectiveness of different DPML techniques and validate their claims under various conditions.

Method: Conduct reproducibility and replicability experiments on 11 state-of-the-art DPML techniques, analyzing their performance under different setups.

Result: Some methods proved reliable, while others failed under conditions beyond their original settings. Unique DPML reproducibility challenges, such as DP noise randomness, are highlighted.

Conclusion: The paper offers best practices to ensure scientifically valid and reproducible results in the domain of DPML.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeLLM, a defense framework using unlearning to eliminate harmful knowledge in LLMs while maintaining their fluency and capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting adversarial prompts, enabling the production of unsafe or biased content, emphasizing the need for a robust defense mechanism.

Method: SafeLLM uses a three-stage unlearning approach: dynamic unsafe output detection, token-level tracing of harmful content, and constrained optimization to ensure safety without compromising model quality.

Result: SafeLLM significantly reduces the success rates of jailbreak attacks on models like Vicuna and LLaMA while preserving the overall performance even against unseen attacks.

Conclusion: Unlearning harmful knowledge presents a scalable and effective approach for enhancing LLM safety, outperforming traditional defense methods in precision, robustness, and safety.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: FairPrep is a benchmarking framework for evaluating fairness-aware pre-processing methods in machine learning, emphasizing model-agnosticism and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of focus and standardized evaluation tools for fairness-aware pre-processing methods despite their advantages (e.g., model-agnosticism, privacy compliance).

Method: Developed FairPrep, an extensible and modular framework using the AIF360 platform to enable efficient benchmarking of pre-processing techniques with seamless integration and automatic reporting.

Result: FairPrep enables reproducible evaluations by providing standardised pipelines for experimenting with and benchmarking fairness-aware pre-processing methods.

Conclusion: FairPrep addresses a crucial gap in fairness research and supports further advancements into pre-processing techniques for fairness in machine learning.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in Tensor Neural Networks' ability to capture high-frequency features due to the Frequency Principle.

Method: Incorporation of random Fourier features and the use of Discrete Fourier Transform on one-dimensional component functions to boost expressivity for high-dimensional problems.

Result: The frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm demonstrated enhanced performance and robustness in solving complex multi-scale problems through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies improve TNNs by effectively addressing frequency feature limitations and the curse of dimensionality, enabling better handling of high-dimensional multi-scale problems.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sleep stage classification methods face challenges in generalizing due to the non-stationarity and variability of EEG/EOG signals, making automated and accurate assessment critical for diagnosing sleep disorders.

Method: The paper proposes SleepDIFFormer, a transformer-based architecture that learns a domain-invariant EEG-EOG representation by mitigating spatial and temporal attention noise and aligning feature distributions across datasets.

Result: SleepDIFFormer showed superior performance on five sleep staging datasets, demonstrating better generalization and achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer advances automated sleep stage classification by addressing key challenges in feature representation and dataset generalization, making it highly applicable for accurate sleep quality assessments. The implementation is open-source.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

*Sishuo Chen,Zhangming Chan,Xiang-Rong Sheng,Lei Zhang,Sheng Chen,Chenghuan Hou,Han Zhu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-Attribution Learning framework for CVR prediction, combining signals from diverse attribution mechanisms to improve prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CVR prediction approaches rely on single attribution mechanisms, neglecting complementary perspectives present in alternative mechanisms.

Method: The proposed Multi-Attribution Learning framework consists of two components: Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (multi-task learner) and Primary Target Predictor (optimized conversion probability predictor). Additionally, the CAT training strategy enriches supervision signals.

Result: MAL demonstrated +0.51% GAUC improvement in offline metrics and a +2.6% ROI increase in online experiments, outperforming traditional single-attribution baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse attribution signals into a unified learning framework significantly improves conversion prediction and meets industrial deployment needs effectively.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

### [203] [Locally Pareto-Optimal Interpretations for Black-Box Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15220)
*Aniruddha Joshi,Supratik Chakraborty,S Akshay,Shetal Shah,Hazem Torfah,Sanjit Seshia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable framework for generating locally optimal Pareto-optimal interpretations of machine learning models, balancing accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenge of generating trustworthy interpretations for black-box machine learning models by addressing the trade-off between accuracy and explainability.

Method: The approach uses a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, followed by verification of local optimality using a SAT solver.

Result: The proposed framework effectively synthesizes Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality guarantees and performs comparably to methods with global guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable alternative for generating reliable interpretations without compromising on the accuracy-explainability trade-off, marking a significant improvement over prior techniques.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

*Yi Yuan,Joseph Van Duyn,Runze Yan,Zhuoyi Huang,Sulaiman Vesal,Sergey Plis,Xiao Hu,Gloria Hyunjung Kwak,Ran Xiao,Alex Fedorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a poly-window contrastive learning framework to improve ECG analysis by utilizing multiple temporal windows for better feature representation, showing better performance and efficiency compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited access to annotated ECG data and improve the performance of deep learning models by leveraging self-supervised contrastive learning with a focus on better utilization of the temporal structure in ECG recordings.

Method: The method involves extracting multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to build positive pairs for contrastive learning. It is inspired by slow feature analysis, encouraging the model to learn temporally invariant and meaningful features across time. The approach concentrates on multi-view comparisons rather than just pairwise viewpoints.

Result: The proposed method, validated on the PTB-XL dataset, outperforms traditional contrastive learning techniques in multi-label classification tasks with higher AUROC and F1 scores. It also significantly reduces pre-training epochs (from 128 to 32) and total computation time (14.8% reduction).

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is an effective and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis, offering enhanced performance and computational efficiency. It provides a promising general framework for self-supervised learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhance LLM reasoning rely on methods like self-consistency with majority voting, which face issues like diminishing accuracy returns and high computational demands.

Method: DeepConf dynamically filters low-quality reasoning traces using model-internal confidence signals during or post generation, requiring no extra training or hyperparameter adjustments.

Result: DeepConf achieves up to 99.9% accuracy in reasoning tasks on benchmarks like AIME 2025, while reducing tokens generated by up to 84.7%, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeepConf is a simple and robust method for improving LLM reasoning tasks, addressing accuracy and efficiency concerns without modifying the underlying models or requiring additional computational complexity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

### [206] [Evaluating Knowledge Graph Complexity via Semantic, Spectral, and Structural Metrics for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15291)
*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines the effectiveness of the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) as a dataset complexity metric in multi-relational link prediction tasks and finds that it is unstable and weakly correlated with performance metrics, proposing alternative metrics for better task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations of the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric in the context of link prediction on knowledge graphs and assess its reliability as a dataset complexity indicator.

Method: The authors critically analyze CSG by incorporating semantic representations from transformer-derived embeddings and comparing it against standard performance metrics. Additionally, they introduce and benchmark alternative structural and semantic complexity metrics for KGs.

Result: Findings indicate that CSG is highly sensitive to parameterization, fails to scale robustly with class cardinality, and exhibits inconsistent correlations with performance metrics like MRR and Hit@1. Proposed alternative metrics such as Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality show stronger correlations with task complexity.

Conclusion: CSG is unreliable in predicting dataset complexity and task difficulty in knowledge graph link prediction tasks. Alternative metrics that capture relational ambiguity or graph connectivity are more interpretable and effective.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

*Zhaorui Tan,Yijie Hu,Xi Yang,Qiufeng Wang,Anh Nguyen,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PL-Reg, a partial-logic regularization technique to improve generalization in visual classification tasks, particularly for unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing to unknown classes in visual classification, an issue where existing paradigms like class discovery and incremental learning have significant limitations.

Method: The authors propose a novel partial-logic regularization (PL-Reg) that reserves space for undefined logic formulas, thus enhancing adaptability to unknown classes. They also provide theoretical evidence for the effectiveness of partial logic in this context.

Result: Empirical evaluations show consistent performance improvements using PL-Reg across tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning.

Conclusion: Partial-logic regularization is effective for improving generalization to unknown classes, demonstrating its potential utility across several challenging classification benchmarks.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

*Saleh Afzoon,Amin Beheshti,Nabi Rezvani,Farshad Khunjush,Usman Naseem,John McMahon,Zahra Fathollahi,Mahdieh Labani,Wathiq Mansoor,Xuyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExBigBang introduces a powerful hybrid text-tabular approach using transformers for contextual persona classification, addressing challenges in capturing user behavior and ensuring model explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in complexity in user interactions necessitates a more contextualized and explainable approach to persona development for user-centric design.

Method: The authors developed ExBigBang, which integrates textual and tabular data via transformer-based architectures, leveraging metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling for dynamic persona classification and enhanced explainability.

Result: Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrated the robustness of ExBigBang, with an ablation study highlighting the effectiveness of combining text and tabular data, alongside Explainable AI techniques elucidating the model's decision-making process.

Conclusion: ExBigBang improves the understanding of user behaviors and their evolution, addressing contextualization and explainability issues to better support persona development in design processes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

*Omri Ben-Dov,Samira Samadi,Amartya Sanyal,Alexandru Å¢ifrea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses strategic data relabeling by minority groups to reduce machine learning bias, proposing three methods for improving fairness without changing training processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in machine learning models leads to unfair outcomes for minority groups, and existing bias mitigation techniques are costly and require firm-level commitment.

Method: Three practical, model-agnostic methods for strategic data relabeling are proposed to empower coordinated minority groups to improve fairness in systems.

Result: The experiments with real-world datasets show that a minority subgroup's action can significantly enhance fairness with minimal impact on overall model performance.

Conclusion: Minority groups can strategically influence fairness in machine learning systems without requiring changes from the firm, using ethical relabeling approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoFormer, a framework addressing Structural Visit Bias and Abrupt Evolution Blindness in dynamic graph representation. EvoFormer uses advanced structural and temporal modules to improve upon existing graph-learning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic graph representation methods often suffer from Structural Visit Bias, favoring high-degree nodes, and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, failing to adapt to structural changes due to inadequate temporal modeling.

Method: EvoFormer leverages (1) a Structure-Aware Transformer Module utilizing structural role-based positional encodings and (2) an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module with strategies like random walk timestamp classification, graph segmentation, and temporal self-attention.

Result: EvoFormer outperforms existing methods across five benchmark datasets for tasks such as graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation.

Conclusion: EvoFormer effectively addresses key limitations in dynamic graph representation, enhancing both structural and temporal modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance in relevant tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CITE, a large textual-citation graph benchmark designed for catalytic material studies, providing standardized evaluations and diverse model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs, limiting the ability to develop and compare representation learning methods effectively.

Method: They created CITE, a graph dataset with over 438,000 nodes and 1.2 million edges across four relation types, and established evaluation protocols with experiments comparing several modeling paradigms.

Result: Comprehensive benchmarks and ablation studies were performed using CITE, showcasing its utility and providing insights across heterogeneous and LLM-integrated models.

Conclusion: CITE is a robust benchmark for studying heterogeneous TAGs in catalytic materials, enabling standardized comparisons for future research and model development.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional clustering methods and leverage Federated Learning for decentralized data processing without the need for sharing raw data.

Method: An Evolving Fuzzy System is developed that dynamically adapts by adding new clusters without requiring pre-specification of cluster numbers. This system is implemented with PyTorch and applied in a Federated Learning setting.

Result: The approach provided better classification performance compared to established methods on multiple benchmarks from UCI datasets, albeit at a high computational cost.

Conclusion: Despite the computational challenges due to overlap condition calculations, the proposed method proves effective in decentralized processing and shows potential for decentralized machine learning tasks.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient hybrid method combining least squares and gradient descent to accelerate DeepONet training by separating optimization into smaller subproblems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency in training DeepONet, specifically focusing on the computational challenges posed by the large linear systems involved in optimizing its parameters.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid method where the last layer branch network parameters are optimized using least squares and the hidden layer parameters are updated using gradient descent, reducing computational complexity by splitting a large problem into two smaller subproblems.

Result: The findings demonstrate that this decomposition approach works for a broader range of $L^2$ losses, including unsupervised learning scenarios with physics-informed models.

Conclusion: This method efficiently accelerates DeepONet training using a hybrid least squares and gradient descent approach that scales to complex scenarios like physics-informed learning.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in HAR systems caused by user-induced concept drift and improve generalization when deployed to new users.

Method: The study employs a hybrid framework with a generalized model for users and a personalized classifier layer using few-shot learning on an energy-efficient GAP9 microcontroller.

Result: Post-deployment adaptation showed consistent improvements in accuracy across three HAR scenarios: 3.73% for RecGym, 17.38% for QVAR-Gesture, and 3.70% for Ultrasound-Gesture.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves fast and efficient personalization on embedded platforms, enabling scalable and user-aware HAR systems with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast method for detecting overlapping multivariate Gaussian clusters in data streams, aiding in adaptive clustering in online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges in existing dissimilarity measures for detecting overlap in clustering under online learning scenarios, which fail to handle diverse shapes and are computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes a novel dissimilarity measure tailored for overlap detection among clusters, focusing on efficient computation and adaptability in streaming data contexts.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing measures in computational speed and effectively identifies overlapping clusters without misinterpreting orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: This new measure improves the clustering process for online learning from data streams by enhancing detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

*Chengcan Wu,Zeming Wei,Huanran Chen,Yinpeng Dong,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) method for machine unlearning in Large Language Models, aiming to effectively eliminate harmful knowledge while preserving useful information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over the safety of Large Language Models are growing due to their capacity to store unsafe knowledge. To address this, the paper seeks to improve machine unlearning methods so models can securely erase harmful data without retaining traces.

Method: The authors propose MRP, which applies irreversible projective transformations in hidden state spaces of specific network layers, eliminating harmful data while preserving useful information.

Result: Experimental results show MRP achieves effective continuous unlearning and defends against relearning attacks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness and maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MRP is a robust solution for ensuring the safety of LLMs by effectively enabling unlearning while avoiding vulnerability to relearning attacks and maintaining natural functioning of the models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

### [218] [A Solvable Molecular Switch Model for Stable Temporal Information Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15451)
*H. I. Nurdin,C. A. Nijhuis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies a one-state differential equation model inspired by dynamic molecular switches for brain-like synapses, showcasing its stability in processing time-varying inputs with desirable learning properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the computational potential of dynamic molecular switches that exhibit synapse-like behavior, combining biological inspiration with mathematical stability for sequential data learning.

Method: The research examines an exactly solvable one-state differential equation model, analyzing its stability, convergence, and fading memory properties.

Result: The model demonstrated desirable mathematical properties, such as stable input processing, convergence, and fading memory, alongside biologically-inspired computational behavior.

Conclusion: The findings support the potential use of dynamic molecular switches in neuromorphic computing architectures, fostering stable learning and brain-like computation models.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

### [219] [Learning Protein-Ligand Binding in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15480)
*Jianhui Wang,Wenyu Zhu,Bowen Gao,Xin Hong,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Yanyan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HypSeek is a hyperbolic representation learning framework that improves protein-ligand binding prediction, achieving significant performance gains in virtual screening and affinity ranking by leveraging hyperbolic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of Euclidean embeddings in capturing the hierarchical structures and fine-grained affinity variations in protein-ligand interactions, essential for drug discovery tasks like virtual screening and affinity ranking.

Method: The authors introduce HypSeek, a hyperbolic embedding framework that uses Lorentz-model hyperbolic space and a protein-guided three-tower architecture for expressive and affinity-sensitive representations of ligands, protein pockets, and sequences.

Result: HypSeek improves early enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E by 20.7% (from 42.63 to 51.44) and affinity ranking correlation on JACS by 25.4% (from 0.5774 to 0.7239), showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study validates the potential of hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive bias in protein-ligand modeling, advancing the fields of virtual screening and affinity ranking in drug discovery.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

*Jiahua Lu,Huaxiao Liu,Shuotong Bai,Junjie Xu,Renqiang Luo,Enyan Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairGuide, a framework that addresses fairness issues in Graph Neural Networks by guiding graph structures with new links to reduce bias and improve fairness in downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks face significant fairness challenges due to biases in graph structures, making it essential to address these biases to foster unbiased communities and improve fairness across applications.

Method: FairGuide uses differentiable community detection as a pseudo downstream task to optimize fairness, supported by a theoretical framework. It identifies fairness-enhancing links via a meta-gradient-based strategy.

Result: FairGuide improves fairness and fairness generalization across diverse graph-based tasks, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates FairGuide's ability to significantly enhance structural fairness in GNNs, improving outcomes in various downstream tasks and fostering unbiased communities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel ADMM-based algorithm for distributed learning over networks, emphasizing both computation- and communication-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient distributed learning algorithms that optimize both computational and communication costs.

Method: Developed an ADMM-based approach integrating stochastic gradients, multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and compressed transmissions.

Result: Demonstrated exact linear convergence in theory and validated the performance with numerical comparisons in classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for distributed learning, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

### [222] [Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function: Differential Privacy without Gradient Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15523)
*Salman Habib,Remi Chou,Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF improves differential privacy in multi-user environments by stabilizing perturbed loss functions without gradient noise, yielding higher accuracy and faster training compared to DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance privacy and stability in multi-user local differential privacy settings while addressing computational inefficiencies and external noise challenges.

Method: SPOF employs a stabilized Taylor-expanded polynomial approximation of the loss function and privatizes coefficients with calibrated noise, avoiding gradient-based noise injections.

Result: SPOF outperforms DP-SGD in tests with a wireless body area network, achieving 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reducing training time by 57.2%.

Conclusion: SPOF offers a superior privacy-utility balance and performance efficiency in environments with heterogeneous and noisy data compared to traditional DP-SGD methods.

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

### [223] [AI-Powered Machine Learning Approaches for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Pumps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15550)
*Khaled M. A. Alghtus,Ayad Gannan,Khalid M. Alhajri,Ali L. A. Al Jubouri,Hassan A. I. Al-Janahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning-driven method for fault detection in industrial marine pump systems using real-world sensor data and synthetic fault injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, interpretable, scalable, and proactive fault detection framework for early identification of failures in critical industrial pump systems.

Method: Sensor data covering five parameters were analyzed using a dual-threshold labeling approach, supplemented with synthetic fault injection. Machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM) were trained for anomaly detection.

Result: Random Forest and XGBoost demonstrated high accuracy across all operational fault classes, while the SVM model showed comparatively lower sensitivity to anomalies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in identifying rare and emerging faults, scalable for other systems, and can facilitate real-time deployment for predictive maintenance.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Conformalized Exceptional Model Mining, a framework combining Conformal Prediction and Exceptional Model Mining to identify data subgroups with unique model performance patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve interpretability and reliability of machine learning models, particularly in high-stakes areas, by highlighting regions of exceptional model performance.

Method: The framework uses a new model class, mSMoPE, and quality measure, RAUL, to identify cohesive subgroups in data with either high confidence or uncertainty.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the ability to discover interpretable patterns and subgroups across diverse datasets that explain model behavior.

Conclusion: The framework advances state-of-the-art explainable AI and uncertainty quantification, offering critical insights for trustworthy machine learning model deployment.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

### [225] [Inductive Domain Transfer In Misspecified Simulation-Based Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15593)
*Ortal Senouf,Antoine Wehenkel,CÃ©dric Vincent-Cuaz,Emmanuel AbbÃ©,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced simulation-based inference (SBI) framework that addresses model misspecification challenges with an inductive, end-to-end trainable system, surpassing prior methods like RoPE in scalability and performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of model misspecification in SBI, a common issue in scenarios where the simulated and real-world data do not align due to modeling simplifications. Existing methods like RoPE are limited by their transductive setting, which reduces scalability and generalizability.

Method: The proposed method combines calibration with mini-batch optimal transport (OT) to align real and simulated data in a fully inductive and amortized framework. A conditional normalizing flow is trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, allowing for inference without simulation access.

Result: The method demonstrated superior or comparable performance to RoPE and other standard estimators across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including complex medical biomarker estimation. It also improved scalability and applicability in environments with misspecifications.

Conclusion: The introduced framework advances SBI by resolving misspecification issues effectively while ensuring scalability and broad applicability. It represents a step forward in making SBI more robust and generalized for real-world applications.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

*Charu Karakkaparambil James,Waleed Mustafa,Marius Kloft,Sophie Fellenz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors introduce the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which addresses continual learning in topic models, enabling the learning of new topics sequentially without forgetting previously learned topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap in topic modeling methods where existing approaches either rely on global data processing (Dynamic Topic Models) or lack memory of past learning (Online Topic Models).

Method: The proposed CoNTM leverages a global prior distribution that is continuously updated, enabling it to maintain long-term memory while learning topic models online.

Result: CoNTM outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of quality, predictive perplexity, and the ability to capture topic changes.

Conclusion: The CoNTM effectively ensures continual learning in topic models, delivering superior performance in capturing diverse topics and temporal changes.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

*Wei Herng Choong,Jixing Liu,Ching-Yu Kao,Philip Sperl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRASPED, a new unsupervised model designed to improve graph-based node anomaly detection by utilizing spectral information through Graph Wavelet Convolution and Wiener Graph Deconvolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of labeled data in graph-based anomaly detection and the limitations of existing methods in leveraging spectral information fully motivate the development of a better unsupervised model.

Method: The authors propose GRASPED, which combines a Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder to capture multi-scale graph information. This design supports reconstruction of node attributes for anomaly detection.

Result: GRASPED outperforms state-of-the-art models for graph anomaly detection across several real-world datasets, achieving better effectiveness in capturing anomalies.

Conclusion: The use of spectral methods like wavelet convolution and graph deconvolution enables a robust framework for unsupervised graph anomaly detection that leverages multi-scale graph information effectively.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

*Lucas Gautheron,Evan Kidd,Anton Malko,Marvin Lavechin,Alejandrina Cristia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how errors in automated audio classifiers affect language research outcomes, proposing a Bayesian method to mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientists use automated classifiers to analyze long audio data for understanding children's language development, but errors in classification can distort scientific findings.

Method: A Bayesian approach is introduced to evaluate and calibrate the impact of classification errors in popular systems (e.g., LENA, Voice Type Classifier) on scientific measurements.

Result: Findings indicate classification errors lead to significant distortions, like underestimating sibling impacts on adult input by 20-80%. Bayesian adjustments help recover unbiased effect sizes but aren't always foolproof.

Conclusion: Measurement bias from classifier errors has notable scientific consequences. Bayesian methods help mitigate these effects but require careful application to ensure accuracy across various classifiers.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

### [229] [Correct-By-Construction: Certified Individual Fairness through Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15642)
*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that guarantees individual fairness in machine learning models throughout their training process using randomized response mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring individual fairness in machine learning algorithms is challenging, especially since current models often fail to achieve fairness or lack formal guarantees.

Method: The framework includes two key components: fair initialization of the model and a fairness-preserving training algorithm, both supported by randomized response mechanisms.

Result: The proposed method guarantees individual fairness during training and produces empirically fair and accurate models, outperforming existing certified training methods in efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework is a promising advancement in achieving individual fairness with formal guarantees, addressing limitations in existing approaches and improving training efficiency.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new transformer-based model, AICMET, effectively predicts patient-specific pharmacokinetics under sparse sampling, offering state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate and efficient method for pharmacokinetic predictions that accommodates inter-patient variability and reduces the traditional time-intensive model development cycle.

Method: The authors introduced AICMET, a transformer-based model combining compartmental priors with Bayesian inference and pre-trained it on synthetic pharmacokinetic data using latent-variable frameworks.

Result: AICMET achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting dosage responses and inter-patient variability across public datasets, outperforming traditional and recent neural methods.

Conclusion: The AICMET model demonstrates the potential of transformer-based architectures for precise, efficient pharmacokinetic modeling, paving the way for personalized medicine advancements.

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

*Eric Ye,Ren Tao,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent environment to study AI's social intelligence, allowing agents to learn from experts and collaborate implicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of developing AI agents capable of social intelligence and adaptive learning in real-world-like multi-agent environments with human experts.

Method: The authors developed a novel environment where self-interested agents can pursue complex goals, enabling emergent cooperative behaviors like tool sharing and confronting shared challenges.

Result: Findings show that social learning in the presence of expert agents and implicit cooperation improves AI agents' performances.

Conclusion: The study concludes that cooperation and competition in complex, open-ended environments can enhance the development of socially intelligent AI agents.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

*Qifeng Hu,Shamsulhaq Basir,Inanc Senocak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces multiple improvements to the PECANN framework for solving partial differential equations, increasing its robustness, efficiency, and applicability to complex scientific problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing artificial neural network approaches for solving PDEs, such as inefficiencies in constraint enforcement, memory overhead, dealing with multi-scale features, and ensuring accuracy in long-time evolution scenarios.

Method: The authors enhance PECANN by generalizing augmented Lagrangian methods, reformulating constraint enforcement with expectations, incorporating Fourier feature mappings for oscillatory PDEs, introducing a time-windowing strategy for long-time modeling, and proposing a conditionally adaptive penalty strategy (CAPU) for optimized penalty updates.

Result: The PECANN-CAPU framework demonstrates highly competitive performance on various challenging PDE problems, including transonic rarefaction, reversible advection, high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse heat source identification, outperforming or matching established alternatives.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed advances make PECANN-CAPU a more robust, effective, and versatile tool for solving a wide range of computationally demanding PDE problems.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific

### [233] [Communication Efficient LLM Pre-training with SparseLoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15706)
*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin ThÃ©rien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo is a new algorithm for communication-efficient training of large language models (LLMs), achieving up to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization with improved performance compared to alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the communication bottleneck in distributed training of LLMs, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments, where current methods cannot adequately leverage sparsification and quantization.

Method: The paper introduces SparseLoCo, which combines Top-k sparsification, quantization, and error feedback for training LLMs. Sparse aggregation is used to compress communication while enhancing performance.

Result: SparseLoCo achieves extreme compression ratios (1-3% sparsity, 2-bit quantization) while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo in communication-constrained settings.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo significantly reduces communication costs while improving performance in distributed LLM training, making it ideal for bandwidth-constrained contexts.

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

*Mohammed Elmusrati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning to address uncertainty and noise in data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a shared theoretical and practical understanding by connecting classical methods with modern AI developments.

Method: Analyzes methods such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms to show common probabilistic principles.

Result: Demonstrates how foundational techniques extend to tackle challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability in AI applications.

Conclusion: Classical and modern methods share a unified goal of inferring hidden causes from noisy data, offering valuable insights for both theory and practice in machine learning.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

### [235] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas JÃ¤rve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the efficacy of likelihood-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using a Variational Diffusion Model applied to a pre-trained ResNet-18's representation space, addressing issues with pixel-space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety challenges in deploying machine learning via out-of-distribution detection and determine the practical limitations of likelihood-based OOD detection.

Method: A Variational Diffusion Model was trained on the representation space (not pixel space) of a pre-trained ResNet-18 to assess OOD detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The study evaluates the performance of likelihood-based OOD detectors in a new context (representation vs. pixel space), offering insights for improving detection methods.

Conclusion: Likelihood can be a viable OOD detection approach within representation spaces, which may overcome the practical limitations observed in pixel-based approaches.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between open-source and closed-source models in challenging scientific domains and move closer to AGI.

Method: A multimodal Mixture-of-Experts model with 28 billion activated and 241 billion total parameters, using 5T tokens for continual pre-training, followed by reinforcement learning in InternBootCamp using Mixture-of-Rewards.

Result: Intern-S1 achieves competitive performance in general reasoning tasks and excels in scientific domains, surpassing state-of-the-art models in domains like molecular synthesis and crystal thermodynamics.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 bridges the existing performance gap in scientific domains and sets a high benchmark for specialized models aiming toward Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

*Kiarash Kazari,Ezzeldin Shereen,GyÃ¶rgy DÃ¡n*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized detector for identifying adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces, achieving high AUC-ROC scores in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems caused by adversarial attacks, particularly for setups with continuous action spaces, ensuring agents can securely collaborate.

Method: A decentralized statistical approach is developed, approximating agent behavior with parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions and using a two-sided CUSUM procedure for real-time anomaly detection.

Result: The method performs effectively across tested multi-agent benchmarks, consistently identifying adversarial attacks with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 0.95.

Conclusion: The proposed detector demonstrates superior performance in adversarial attack detection, offering a robust tool for ensuring security in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore transformers' capacity for latent pattern discovery in functional decomposition, focusing on solving the NP-hard problem of multivariate polynomial decomposition due to its significant applications in science and engineering.

Method: The paper employs synthetic data generation for customized problem complexity, trains transformer models, evaluates their performance, and introduces BGRPO, a rank-aware reinforcement learning approach to enhance model accuracy and computation efficiency.

Result: The introduced BGRPO method achieves improved accuracy, cuts beam width by half, and lowers inference compute by 75%. In polynomial simplification tasks, the model shows competitive performance, even surpassing Mathematica in certain cases.

Conclusion: The research showcases the potential of transformers for challenging algebraic problems, establishing frameworks for synthetic dataset generation, model evaluation, and reinforcement learning utilization to optimize computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

### [239] [A Scalable Trie Building Algorithm for High-Throughput Phyloanalysis of Wafer-Scale Digital Evolution Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15074)
*Vivaan Singhvi,Joey Wagner,Emily Dolson,Luis Zaman,Matthew Andres Moreno*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved algorithm for phylogeny reconstruction, enabling faster and more scalable analyses in agent-based simulations of digital evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate large-scale evolutionary questions using AI/ML hardware while addressing memory and runtime constraints in phylogeny tracking.

Method: Developed an enhanced trie-building algorithm for reconstructing phylogenies from genetic markers in digital evolution experiments.

Result: Proposal resulted in a 300-fold speedup for 10,000-tip trees and successfully reconstructed large-scale datasets in under 3 hours.

Conclusion: The work advances high-throughput phyloanalysis techniques, facilitating more efficient study of evolutionary processes at unprecedented scales.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

*John E. Hummel,Rachel F. Heaton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study explores why human brains excel at symbolic reasoning while most animals do not, highlighting the roles of dynamic binding, multi-place predicates, and structure mapping as minimal requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique cognitive mechanisms in human brains that enable symbolic reasoning, distinguishing them from those of other animals, and to examine their implications for AI systems.

Method: Seventeen systematic simulations were conducted to investigate whether cognitive architectures with capacities for multi-place predicates and structure mapping could handle tasks demanding symbolic thought.

Result: The findings support the idea that dynamic binding, along with multi-place predicates and structure mapping, are minimal prerequisites for symbolic reasoning.

Conclusion: Human symbolic reasoning relies on more than just dynamic binding; additional cognitive integrations like multi-place predicates and structure mapping are crucial. Implications extend to advancing bio-inspired AI, suggesting routes to improved generalization abilities in artificial systems.

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a homomorphism calculus to verify and refute whether a user-defined aggregation function (UDAF) is a dataframe homomorphism, enabling efficient execution in frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to execute UDAFs efficiently in data processing frameworks by ensuring they satisfy the homomorphism property.

Method: Developing a novel homomorphism calculus and implementing an algorithm to verify/refute dataframe homomorphism for UDAFs, including constructing merge operators for parallel and incremental computation.

Result: The proposed technique was evaluated on real-world UDAFs and showed significant performance improvements over two leading synthesizers.

Conclusion: The homomorphism calculus is effective for optimizing UDAFs execution in data processing frameworks, improving computational efficiency and supporting parallel execution.

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPS is a new software model-checking algorithm leveraging compositional static analysis for efficient bug detection and safety proofs. It outperformed state-of-the-art tools in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model checking is critical for ensuring software reliability, but existing tools struggle with efficiency in detecting bugs, particularly in complex, input-dependent error paths.

Method: GPS uses a directed search of program states driven by static analysis-derived summaries. It applies a two-layered search strategy and introduces instrumentation for refutational completeness.

Result: GPS demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art model checkers, solving more benchmarks and achieving faster runtime.

Conclusion: GPS represents an efficient and comprehensive advancement in software model checking, proving its capabilities through extensive benchmarking.

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [243] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "big-stop semantics," an extension of big-step semantics that can describe divergence (without errors) while retaining ergonomic advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard big-step semantics are easier to use than small-step semantics but lack the ability to describe diverging computations.

Method: The authors extend big-step semantics by adding a few inference rules that define evaluation judgments equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions.

Result: The proposed big-stop semantics captures diverging computations without introducing error states or sacrificing user-friendly ergonomics.

Conclusion: Big-stop semantics provide an alternative to other approaches for modeling divergence, maintaining simplicity and minimalism while solving limitations of traditional big-step semantics.

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Praline, extending Datalog for probabilistic reasoning with correlated input facts, offering tight probability bounds through scalable optimization and refinement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic logic programming frameworks like ProbLog fail to handle statistical correlations among input facts, necessitating a new approach for accurate probabilistic reasoning.

Method: The authors propose Praline, which formulates probabilistic inference as a constrained optimization problem, complemented by a $\\delta$-exact inference algorithm utilizing constraint solving, static analysis, and iterative refinement.

Result: Praline achieves scalable and precise inference, verified using real-world benchmarks like side-channel analysis, showing effectiveness in tight probability bound predictions.

Conclusion: Praline successfully integrates logic programming with probabilistic reasoning under correlated inputs, providing a scalable and accurate inference mechanism for practical applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,JosÃ© Manuel CalderÃ³n Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the Entity-Component-System (ECS) design pattern used in game development to develop a model (Core ECS) that ensures deterministic concurrency, highlighting opportunities for new ECS framework techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of rigorous understanding and formal explanations of the ECS design pattern outside game development, in order to identify deterministic concurrency possibilities.

Method: The authors design a formal model called Core ECS to abstract the details of specific ECS frameworks and analyze its core principles. They compare this model with existing ECS frameworks to evaluate deterministic concurrency potential.

Result: The study finds that existing ECS frameworks do not fully utilize deterministic concurrency opportunities, and Core ECS highlights these shortcomings.

Conclusion: The research opens up possibilities for new implementation techniques that better exploit deterministic concurrency within the ECS design pattern.

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

*Francesco Dagnino,Paola Giannini,Violet Ka I Pun,Ulises Torrella*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper develops a core calculus and type system for resource-aware active objects, combining graded semantics and fair termination techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-awareness and concurrency in distributed systems call for better formalization methods, particularly ensuring fair termination of active object workflows.

Method: The proposed solution integrates graded semantics for sequential programs with fair termination approaches from synchronous sessions.

Result: Well-typed programs in the proposed system are guaranteed to fairly terminate.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces a resource-aware formalization for active object modeling with assured fair termination properties.

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with

### [247] [Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576)
*Andreas LÃ¶Ã¶w,Seung Hoon Park,Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho,Sacha-Ãlie Ayoun,Opale SjÃ¶stedt,Philippa Gardner*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formal foundation for memory-model-parametric compositional symbolic execution (CSE) platforms, addressing gaps in flexibility and formalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research shows the benefit of using custom memory models in CSE platforms for better support across languages, automation, and performance. However, a robust formal basis for these platforms is missing.

Method: The authors provide a mechanized foundation within Rocq, validate it against various memory models, integrate both separation logic (SL) and incorrectness separation logic (ISL) analyses, and base their framework on standard definitions.

Result: The proposed formal foundation successfully supports a wide range of memory models, incorporates SL and ISL analyses, and ensures compatibility with existing tools through standard definitions.

Conclusion: The paper advances CSE platform development, offering a versatile, formally validated approach that improves integration and memory model handling.

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [248] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel active learning approach for neurosymbolic program synthesis to address neural network mispredictions during targeted user interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inadequacy of existing active learning methods in neurosymbolic program synthesis, where neural components may lead to unintended program outcomes.

Method: The proposed method introduces constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), a strategy that iteratively refines program predictions by taking neural mispredictions and user feedback into account until observational equivalence is achieved.

Result: The method, implemented in the SmartLabel tool, achieves a 98% success rate in identifying the ground truth program across benchmarks, requiring less than 5 user interaction rounds on average, outperforming previous methods that only achieved up to 65%.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the new active learning approach effectively handles neural network mispredictions, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to prior techniques in neurosymbolic program synthesis use cases.

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

*Murilo Vinicius da Silva,Matheus Hipolito Carvalho,Juliano Negri,Thiago Segreto,Gustavo J. G. Lahr,Ricardo V. Godoy,Marcelo Becker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a teleoperation system for quadruped robots using vision-based wrist tracking to intuitively control a robotic arm in real-time, enhancing safety and simplicity in hazardous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teleoperating quadruped robots with manipulator arms in hazardous or dynamic environments is complex and risky due to intuitive control constraints, leading to safety and efficiency challenges.

Method: The study utilizes an external camera with machine learning-based pose estimation to detect operators' wrist movements. This data is mapped to robotic arm commands, and a trajectory planner prevents collisions during teleoperation.

Result: The system was implemented and tested on a real robot, showcasing robust, real-time performance with improved safety and intuitiveness in control.

Conclusion: This cost-effective teleoperation approach enhances safety, precision, and ease of use in industrial applications involving quadruped robots, making it suitable for high-risk environments.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

### [250] [GraspQP: Differentiable Optimization of Force Closure for Diverse and Robust Dexterous Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15002)
*RenÃ© ZurbrÃ¼gg,Andrei Cramariuc,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating diverse and physically feasible grasp data using a differentiable energy formulation, offering improvements over traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous robotic hands require diverse grasp data to maximize their versatility and capabilities in various tasks and environments.

Method: The authors propose a Quadratic Program-based differentiable energy formulation of force closure, integrated with an optimized sampling technique called MALA*.

Result: The method yields significant improvements in grasp diversity and stability, demonstrated through experiments and a new large dataset for 5,700 objects covering various grasps.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for enhancing grasp generation methods and contributes a comprehensive dataset, advancing robotics manipulation applications.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

*Mark Van der Merwe,Devesh Jha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic manipulation tasks using in-context learning, showing superior performance in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown remarkable abilities in language tasks, extending these capabilities to dynamic manipulation involving complex systems is less explored. The paper seeks to leverage LLMs for this challenging domain.

Method: The authors adopt an iterative approach, employing in-context learning to adjust a parametric policy based on past interactions. Experiments are conducted both in simulation and with a physical robot.

Result: In-context learning proves to be more effective than alternative methods, particularly in scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the promising application of pre-trained LLMs for dynamic manipulation tasks, showcasing their potential in advancing robotics and related fields.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for monitoring wildlife either focus broadly on herds or require manual operation, limiting scalability and efficiency. A scalable and autonomous solution is needed for analyzing behaviors and intervening on health and safety.

Method: The authors propose a decentralized system using multi-quadrotors equipped with single RGB cameras. They developed vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms optimized for dynamic and unstructured environments, avoiding centralized control.

Result: The system was validated through real-world experiments, showing reliable performance in diverse field conditions for identifying and tracking wildlife.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-quadrotor system demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, vision-based autonomous tracking and monitoring of wildlife in natural environments, overcoming limitations of previous centralized and labor-intensive methods.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to
identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous
collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous
robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are
manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based
multi-quadrotor system for wildlife monitoring that is scalable, low-bandwidth,
and sensor-minimal (single onboard RGB camera). Our approach enables robust
identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We
develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for
dynamic, unstructured environments without reliance on centralized
communication or control. We validate our system through real-world
experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bio-inspired General-to-Particular (G2P) learning algorithm for rapid adaptability in tendon-driven quadruped robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a robot control algorithm inspired by mammalian exploration-exploitation to tackle incomplete knowledge of the body structure and environment, and adapt to continuous changes.

Method: A tendon-driven quadruped robot learns cyclical movements with a two-phase process: initial motor babbling (5 minutes) and refinement trials (15 trials of 20 seconds each).

Result: Proof-of-concept results show the robot learns functional and adaptive control in minutes, achieving non-convex cyclical movements with redundancies.

Conclusion: The G2P approach demonstrates potential for advancing robotic locomotion, enabling robots to dynamically adapt to new environments and ensure sustained performance.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents Mag-Match, a method using 3D magnetic fields for map registration in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of map matching and registration in environments like smoke or dust where traditional visual or geometric sensors struggle.

Method: Introduces Mag-Match, leveraging higher-order derivatives of magnetic fields via a physics-informed Gaussian Process for feature extraction and map registration.

Result: Achieved accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map, and robot-to-robot transformations in both simulated and real-world tests, outperforming a SIFT-based approach.

Conclusion: Mag-Match provides a robust and orientation-invariant solution for map registration using magnetic fields, enabling applications in adverse environments.

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Motivation: Address persistent challenges in pallet handling automation due to labor shortages, safety issues, and inefficiencies in manual operations under unstructured outdoor conditions.

Method: Utilizes foundation models for language-guided pallet detection and pose estimation, integrated into a motion planning module for autonomous forklift operation.

Result: Achieved 0.76 mIoU pallet segmentation accuracy in real-world tests, showcasing robustness in outdoor environments and confirming deployment feasibility.

Conclusion: Lang2Lift demonstrates the potential for scalable and safe automation in logistics and construction, mitigating labor challenges while ensuring operational efficiency.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between dynamic, adaptive reasoning and robust physical execution in industrial drone applications.

Method: SRDrone employs continuous state evaluation for better task assessment and a hierarchical Behavior Tree model for structured, reflective learning.

Result: The system achieves a 44.87% improvement in success rate over baselines and 96.25% success rate in real-world deployment.

Conclusion: SRDrone demonstrates effective integration of adaptive intelligence with physical constraints, significantly improving industrial drone performance.

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

TL;DR: The paper proposes Kitchen-R, a new benchmark for evaluating robotic systems in both task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for robotics and embodied AI either focus too narrowly on high-level language instructions or low-level control tasks, lacking comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems.

Method: Kitchen-R leverages the Isaac Sim simulator and involves over 500 complex language instructions for a mobile manipulator robot. It includes baseline methods for task planning using vision-language models and low-level control via diffusion policy.

Result: The benchmark provides a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: separate assessment of planning and control components, and joint evaluation of the entire system.

Conclusion: Kitchen-R fills a gap in embodied AI research by enabling holistic benchmarking that combines task planning and physical execution in a realistic simulated environment.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

*Annie S. Chen,Philemon Brakel,Antonia Bronars,Annie Xie,Sandy Huang,Oliver Groth,Maria Bauza,Markus Wulfmeier,Nicolas Heess,Dushyant Rao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method called Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP) to address the issue of robots idling during learning-based dexterous manipulation tasks. This approach applies controlled perturbations to escape idling states and improves both performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic policies for dexterous manipulation lack reliability and robustness, often leading to idling behavior due to inadequacies in training data or precision demands. Existing mitigation strategies negatively impact performance, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: The authors introduce Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), a technique to detect idling states and apply targeted perturbations. It enables the robot to escape suboptimal states and provides episodes for iterative policy improvement without additional supervision or training.

Result: PIP demonstrated noticeable performance improvement in simulated dual-arm tasks and a 15-35% success rate increase in a real-world multi-finger manipulation insertion task.

Conclusion: Pause-Induced Perturbations provide a simple yet effective way to enhance exploration and policy performance, addressing idling issues and improving reliability in complex dexterous manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

*Gargi Das,Daegyun Choi,Donghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a trajectory optimization algorithm that leverages, rather than minimizes, dynamic coupling in free-floating space manipulator systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic coupling between the manipulator and its base in SMS affects system behavior significantly, but its benefits have been largely overlooked.

Method: Using singular value decomposition (SVD), dynamic coupling metrics are formulated and integrated into a trajectory optimization approach, supported by sliding mode control for validation.

Result: Simulations highlight that considering dynamic coupling in trajectory planning produces efficient system operations.

Conclusion: Leveraging dynamic coupling instead of minimizing it offers improved trajectory planning and opens new paths for SMS control innovations.

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the

accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

*Jie Xu,Eric Heiden,Iretiayo Akinola,Dieter Fox,Miles Macklin,Yashraj Narang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics) replaces traditional analytical simulators by using a generalizable and robot-centric neural approach to simulate articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints, showing improved stability, accuracy, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing neural simulators that require application-specific training and fail to generalize across tasks and environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of global states.

Method: The authors introduce NeRD, a neural dynamics model that replaces low-level dynamics and contact solvers in traditional simulators. It uses a robot-centric, spatially-invariant state representation and integrates as a backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator.

Result: Extensive experiments show NeRD's stability and accuracy over many simulation steps, ability to generalize across tasks and environments, and enable policy learning in neural engines. Additionally, it can be fine-tuned with real-world data, bridging the simulation-to-reality gap.

Conclusion: NeRD provides a robust alternative to classical simulators by offering accurate, efficient, and generalizable neural simulation capabilities for modern robots, particularly those structured as articulated rigid bodies.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

### [263] [On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135)
*Sumudu Liyanage,Sherlock A. Licorish,Markus Wagner,Stephen G. MacDonell*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper critiques current automated program repair (APR) tools and proposes an evaluation framework, testing it on Sorald, revealing significant flaws and side effects in APR outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inadequacies in the evaluation of APR tools, which often overlook the introduction of new violations, functional issues, and structural problems in repaired code.

Method: The authors tested Sorald, a state-of-the-art APR tool, on 3,529 SonarQube violations within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. They assessed its capacity to fix violations and its unintended side effects, including new faults, functional correctness, and code structure degradation.

Result: Sorald successfully fixed certain rule violations but introduced 2,120 new faults, reduced functional correctness (24% unit test failures), and degraded code structure.

Conclusion: Evaluation frameworks for APR tools must be more comprehensive to account for side effects, ensuring safer and more effective tool adoption.

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for integrating Generative AI with traditional software engineering to build robust and adaptable systems, presenting design principles and architectural patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unpredictability and inefficiency in current Generative AI systems are barriers to creating reliable solutions for various domains.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework consisting of five design principles (reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance) and architectural patterns (like GenAI-native cells and substrates).

Result: Key ingredients of a GenAI software stack are outlined, along with discussions on implications for technology, adoption, economy, and legal considerations.

Conclusion: This conceptual framework aims to advance research and inspire practical applications for building resilient and efficient GenAI systems.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

*Ruiqi Wang,Zezhou Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study delves into enhancing code understanding tasks using knowledge distillation (KD) to compress pre-trained language models (PLMs), achieving efficiency with minimal loss of performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational intensity and latency of deploying large-scale PLMs in code understanding tasks demand a solution that balances efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: The researchers investigated logit-based and feature-based KD methods across eight student models and two teacher PLMs on three downstream tasks.

Result: KD consistently improves student models across different sizes, with feature-based methods achieving notable performance retention (up to 98%) using only 5% parameters of the teacher.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation proves effective for compressing PLMs in code tasks, with insights provided on architecture impacts, process outcomes, and future research directions.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

*Dongjun Yu,Xiao Yan,Zhenrui Li,Jipeng Xiao,Haochuan He,Yongda Yu,Hao Zhang,Guoping Rong,Xiaobo Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynthCoder, a model optimized for the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task, achieving state-of-the-art performance using tailored training techniques and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code completion in software engineering requires models with quick response times, and existing optimization methods often struggle with trade-offs, reducing performance on certain datasets or metrics. The paper aims to address these challenges and achieve consistent and high-quality code completion.

Method: SynthCoder combines diverse dataset creation using AST nodes and heuristics, cross-file context enrichment with BM25 and call graphs, and a two-step training process employing Curriculum Learning and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) techniques.

Result: The SynthCoder model outperforms on benchmarks like aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT, while reducing repeated code generation issues common in other models.

Conclusion: SynthCoder effectively utilizes advanced training methods, curated datasets, and contextual enhancement techniques to deliver superior code completion performance without significant trade-offs.

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of reliable datasets for evaluating task-based chatbots by introducing two datasets, TOFU-R and BRASATO, to improve robustness and reproducibility in chatbot research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets and effective evaluation techniques for task-based chatbots, which impair proper assessment of their reliability and robustness.

Method: They developed two datasets: TOFU-R, a snapshot of open-source Rasa chatbots on GitHub, and BRASATO, a curated selection of chatbots emphasizing dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility.

Result: The paper presents the datasets coupled with supportive tools to create and maintain them, ensuring ease of use and reproducibility for researchers.

Conclusion: The provided datasets, TOFU-R and BRASATO, fill critical gaps in chatbot evaluation by fostering standardized assessment, reproducibility, and advancing chatbot reliability research.

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by the non-determinism, opaque training data, and evolving architectures of LLMs in the context of empirical studies in software engineering.

Method: The authors proposed a taxonomy for LLM-based study types and eight guidelines covering essential and desired criteria to enhance transparency and reproducibility.

Result: The paper presents clear guidelines that include disclosing LLM configurations, logging interactions, using human validation, employing open LLMs as baselines, and emphasizing limitations and mitigations.

Conclusion: The effort aims to establish a framework for reproducible and replicable research involving LLMs, serving as a resource for the community to build upon.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of attention on software maintainability and proposes an adaptation of the QUPER model, named QUPER-MAn, to guide engineering practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software maintainability often receives inadequate attention despite its importance for sustainable development.

Method: Conducted an exploratory study of industry practices surrounding maintainability requirements and proposed QUPER-MAn using a design science approach.

Result: Confirmed that maintainability is often overlooked in industry and introduced QUPER-MAn for setting maintainability benchmarks.

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn has the potential to turn maintainability into an actively managed target rather than an incidental outcome.

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

*Yi Zhang,He Jiang,Xiaochen Li,Shikai Guo,Peiyu Zou,Zun Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VERMEI is an automated testing framework for FPGA synthesis tools, outperforming existing methods by identifying complex bugs efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defects in FPGA synthesis tools can lead to significant security and functionality issues, necessitating robust testing approaches.

Method: VERMEI uses preprocessing to identify zombie logic, Bayesian sampling to generate complex program mutations, and differential testing for bug identification.

Result: In five months of testing on major FPGA synthesis tools, VERMEI identified 15 bugs, with 9 confirmed as new.

Conclusion: VERMEI effectively enhances the rigor in testing FPGA synthesis tools, offering a superior approach to detecting critical bugs.

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

TL;DR: The study introduces a workshop-based technical debt management (TDM) process in an IT company, showing improvements in TD awareness and sustainable changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between frequent research on TDM and its rare practical application, establishing a feasible and effective TDM process in an actual IT team environment.

Method: Conducted action research involving five action cycles over 16 months with an IT team specializing in signal processing. Techniques included workshops, team observation, TD-SAGAT method for awareness measurement, and backlog data evaluation.

Result: Practitioners adopted TD repayment prioritized by system evolution and cost. Awareness was increased via reminders like checkboxes and templates in the backlog. Sustainable TD management processes were observed.

Conclusion: The workshop-based method effectively increased TD awareness and led to sustainable TDM process changes, offering new transferable TDM strategies for other IT teams.

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EO_k, a kernel-based fairness criterion for supervised learning, ensuring fairness while maintaining prediction accuracy and balancing independence, separation, and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of mitigating discrimination against sensitive attributes while maintaining predictive accuracy in machine learning models.

Method: A novel kernel-based fairness criterion, EO_k, is proposed, emphasizing quantifying fairness objectives and offering analytical tradeoffs. EO_k's empirical counterpart, hat EO_k, is computable efficiently with performance guarantees via derived concentration inequalities.

Result: EO_k satisfies independence and separation under unbiased conditions, preserving prediction accuracy and offering bounds on other fairness criteria under biased conditions. Practical computation methods for EO_k are provided.

Conclusion: The kernel-based EO_k framework establishes a unified and principled approach to fairness in supervised learning, forming a foundation for future algorithmic fairness studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system identification tool that unifies online and offline Bayesian inference and learning, enabling the integration of explicit and implicit prior system knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of fusing diverse prior knowledge, such as known system equations and assumptions about unknown model parts, with limited available data for modeling dynamical systems.

Method: The method involves a novel interface combining known dynamics functions with learning-based approximations of unknown system parts and deriving closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization without user-tailored transformations.

Result: The proposed framework successfully integrates data-driven learning with prior knowledge, demonstrated in three distinct case studies, including experimental data.

Conclusion: The framework is a general-purpose tool for inference and learning in dynamical systems, simplifying model structure integration without requiring labor-intensive expert interventions.

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the cumulative regret bounds of the Gaussian process expected improvement (GP-EI) algorithm for Bayesian optimization and provides theoretical guarantees for various choices of the incumbent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the open question regarding the cumulative regret upper bound of the widely used acquisition function, Expected Improvement (EI), in Bayesian optimization, and to provide theoretical guidance for practitioners.

Method: The authors analyze the GP-EI algorithm under a Bayesian setting with three commonly used incumbent choices: BPMI, BSPMI, and BOI. They derive cumulative regret bounds using SE and MatÃ©rn kernels and validate their findings through numerical experiments.

Result: The paper presents cumulative regret upper bounds for GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI, proving they are no-regret algorithms. For BOI, the analysis reveals sublinear cumulative regret bounds or fast-converging noisy simple regret bounds.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into the selection of incumbents for GP-EI in noisy settings, advancing understanding and practical applications of Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

*Ronald Richman,Salvatore Scognamiglio,Mario V. WÃ¼thrich*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural network architecture improving predictive accuracy and interpretability by explicitly modeling pairwise feature interactions in tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a challenge in predictive modeling, especially in insurance pricing, to effectively model feature interactions in tabular datasets while maintaining interpretability.

Method: PIN mimics the structure of decision trees within a feed-forward neural network architecture to capture pairwise feature interactions, allowing intrinsic interpretability and efficient SHAP computations.

Result: When tested on the French motor insurance dataset, PIN surpasses traditional and modern neural network models in predictive accuracy and provides clear insights into feature interactions.

Conclusion: PIN proves to be a more accurate and interpretable approach for capturing feature interactions in tabular predictive modeling compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

### [277] [A Unified Framework for Inference with General Missingness Patterns and Machine Learning Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15162)
*Xingran Chen,Tyler McCormick,Bhramar Mukherjee,Zhenke Wu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel statistical method leveraging machine learning imputations to address general missingness patterns under the realistic MAR assumption, providing valid inference and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scientific inference using ML imputations often assume MCAR, which is impractical in many scenarios. This paper aims to address limitations in handling data with realistic MAR assumptions and general missingness patterns.

Method: The proposed method involves stratifying data by missingness patterns and aggregating pattern-specific information via a masking-and-imputation procedure on complete cases. This is achieved using weighted analysis techniques.

Result: Theoretical guarantees include asymptotic normality and efficiency superiority over existing weighted complete-case analyses. Extensive simulations validate these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The method allows for easier implementation using existing tools and demonstrates robust practical applications despite some limitations, setting a foundation for future research directions.

Abstract: Pre-trained machine learning (ML) predictions have been increasingly used to
complement incomplete data to enable downstream scientific inquiries, but their
naive integration risks biased inferences. Recently, multiple methods have been
developed to provide valid inference with ML imputations regardless of
prediction quality and to enhance efficiency relative to complete-case
analyses. However, existing approaches are often limited to missing outcomes
under a missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption, failing to handle
general missingness patterns under the more realistic missing-at-random (MAR)
assumption. This paper develops a novel method which delivers valid statistical
inference framework for general Z-estimation problems using ML imputations
under the MAR assumption and for general missingness patterns. The core
technical idea is to stratify observations by distinct missingness patterns and
construct an estimator by appropriately weighting and aggregating
pattern-specific information through a masking-and-imputation procedure on the
complete cases. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality of
the proposed estimator and efficiency dominance over weighted complete-case
analyses. Practically, the method affords simple implementations by leveraging
existing weighted complete-case analysis software. Extensive simulations are
carried out to validate theoretical results. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion on practical implications, limitations, and potential future
directions.

### [278] [On Prior Distributions for Orthogonal Function Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15552)
*Shonosuke Sugasawa,Daichi Mochihashi*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal functions, key for statistical models like FPCA, which adaptively ensure orthogonality while balancing smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for priors that ensure orthogonality in functional models like FPCA, a vital component for interpretability and low-dimensional representations.

Method: The authors design hierarchical, conditionally normal distributions with adaptive orthogonality constraints controlled by hyperparameters, which are learnable from data.

Result: The proposed method achieves nearly orthogonal posterior estimates, leading to interpretable functions and efficient dimensionality reduction, validated via simulations and human mobility data analysis.

Conclusion: The novel priors effectively balance orthogonality and smoothness, enhancing FPCA performance in functional component estimation.

Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal
functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as
functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors
sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a
hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The
orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible
trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the
observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that
it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is
employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and
efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of
human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component
estimation.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper analyzes continual ridge regression using random matrix theory to precisely understand generalization performance in high-dimensional setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in theoretical understanding related to generalization performance in continual learning while navigating catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The paper employs random matrix theory for theoretical derivation of prediction risks and evaluation metrics in high-dimensional linear models.

Result: It establishes exact expressions for asymptotic prediction risk and key generalization metrics, revealing trends and phenomena in risk curves during continual learning.

Conclusion: The research deepens theoretical insights into how model specifications affect generalization in continual learning, supported by simulation validations.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

### [280] [Effect Identification and Unit Categorization in the Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity Design with Application to LED Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15692)
*Philipp Alexander Schwarz,Oliver Schacht,Sven Klaassen,Johannes Oberpriller,Martin Spindler*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in using multi-score regression discontinuity design (MRD) and proposes a framework to identify and reduce estimation fuzziness by categorizing unit behavior types and improving estimates, demonstrated on data from semiconductor manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of applying multi-dimensional regression discontinuity designs (MRD) in practical and production settings, where common approaches often introduce non-compliance issues.

Method: The paper develops theoretical tools to categorize unit behavior in multi-dimensional cutoff rules, identifies conditions to stabilize identification of effects, and investigates decomposition of cutoff rules. These methods are validated on both simulated and real-world data.

Result: The proposed framework reduces estimation variance and improves the practicality of MRD in optimizing policies, as demonstrated in empirical results from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing.

Conclusion: The approach offers a structured way to refine production policies and achieve better estimation accuracy in MRD, showing practical applicability in industries like manufacturing.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven air interface for 6G networks, emphasizing compression and adaptation for semantic communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish AI as a core capability across all stages of 6G networks and optimize communication through semantic extraction and dynamic adaptation.

Method: Proposed a native AI-based air interface architecture utilizing semantic compression and dynamic adaptation, including methodologies and case studies.

Result: Demonstrated how semantic communication works effectively in 6G non-terrestrial networks and identified challenges.

Conclusion: Native AI in 6G networks offers powerful opportunities, but further research is essential to address implementation challenges and unlock its full potential.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

### [282] [Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation for Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15185)
*Dingzhu Wen,Sijing Xie,Xiaowen Cao,Yuanhao Cui,Jie Xu,Yuanming Shi,Shuguang Cui*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper investigates over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) integrated with sensing, communication, and computation, addressing the challenge of coordination for efficient model training via an optimized algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the complexity in federated edge learning systems where sensing, communication, and computation must collaboratively optimize performance, especially considering the effects of noise and resource limitations.

Method: The study analyzes the convergence behavior of the Air-FEEL system, considering noise and aggregation distortions. It proposes a low-complexity algorithm that alternately optimizes batch size control and network resource allocation based on theoretical insights.

Result: The analysis proves that sensing, communication, and computation jointly impact convergence. An algorithm is developed that optimizes parameter settings under latency and energy constraints, and numerical results validate its efficacy in enhancing learning performance.

Conclusion: The proposed ISCC algorithm effectively coordinates sensing, communication, and computation, improving learning performance under practical constraints, as verified by theoretical and numerical analyses.

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in heart failure detection research specific to Chinese speech, leveraging the proven utility of speech data in HF detection demonstrated in other languages.

Method: The study introduces a Chinese speech database of HF patients, incorporates 'patient-wise' and 'pair-wise' classification approaches, and develops an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) for frequency importance analysis.

Result: The research confirms the viability of HF detection in Chinese speech and identifies individual differences as critical to accuracy. The findings are shared publicly as datasets and demonstrations.

Conclusion: Chinese speech is effective for heart failure detection using speech-based classification approaches, with the proposed 'pair-wise' method offering a promising baseline for future studies.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LM-based TTS systems often produce hallucinated speech, which existing solutions struggle to address efficiently.

Method: GOAT involves uncertainty analysis to identify the relationship between hallucinations and model uncertainty, followed by reformulating TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem using specific objectives.

Result: The framework decreases character error rates by over 50% and reduces uncertainty by up to 58% on challenging test cases.

Conclusion: GOAT offers a resource-efficient and effective solution for improving accuracy and reliability in LM-based TTS systems.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of graph reordering for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on GPUs, achieving 15% query-per-second (QPS) improvements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although graph-based ANNS has seen algorithmic advances, memory layout considerations, which significantly impact GPU execution time, have been overlooked.

Method: The authors developed a unified evaluation framework with a graph adapter for standardizing representations and a GPU-optimized traversal engine to assess various graph reordering strategies.

Result: Comprehensive analysis across datasets and indices revealed that GPU-targeted reordering improved QPS by up to 15% without compromising search accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimizing memory layout is complementary to algorithmic innovations, and the released code will promote reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome persistent challenges such as data sparsity, cold start users/items, and privacy constraints in recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities.

Method: DeepNaniNet employs an inductive graph-based architecture integrating user-item interactions, item-item relations, and BERT-based textual review embeddings. It introduces a "content basket" representation for users and an autoencoder for generalization to new users.

Result: DeepNaniNet excels in cold start recommendations, achieving state-of-the-art on CiteULike benchmark and outperforming weighted matrix factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike dataset in both cold and warm start scenarios.

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet proves effective in making high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in environments with sparse data and cold start predicaments. It successfully integrates diverse content sources.

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid recommendation system that integrates Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory with deep neural networks for improved performance on the MovieLens 1M dataset, demonstrating robustness in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to harness the computational advantages of quantum computing for enhancing machine learning applications, focusing specifically on optimization challenges in recommendation systems.

Method: The hybrid system combines quantum-based Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks and K-Means clustering for pattern encoding, trained on the MovieLens 1M dataset over 35 epochs both in ideal and noisy environments.

Result: The model achieved high metrics (ROC, accuracy, F-1 Score) in both ideal and noisy setups, showcasing consistent performance and optimized qubit overhead in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates variational quantum computing with deep learning to handle real-world datasets, offering robust performance even in noisy conditions, suggesting significant potential for recommendation systems in practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Few-Shot Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a black-box attack method using large language models to generate misleading high-ranking documents without direct model manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerability of neural ranking models (NRMs) to adversarial manipulation and the growing concern over authenticity in information retrieval systems.

Method: FSAP employs few-shot prompting with large language models, conditioned on harmful examples, to create fluent documents embedding false information. It operates in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ (query-specific examples) and FSAP-InterQ (cross-query patterns).

Result: Experiments show FSAP-generated documents outperform accurate documents in ranking while being difficult to detect and aligned with harmful stances. It generalizes across different language models.

Conclusion: FSAP poses a significant threat to information authenticity in neural retrieval systems, suggesting the need for improved defenses against adversarial document generation.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces COSETTE and MARIUS to enhance generative recommender systems by addressing tokenization and architectural inefficiencies, matching or surpassing the performance of traditional ID-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying and resolving the limitations of generative recommender systems, such as poor collaborative signal and encoder-decoder inefficiencies, to improve their practical performance.

Method: Proposed COSETTE for collaborative tokenization and MARIUS, a lightweight generative model, focusing on optimizing item representations and efficient timeline modeling.

Result: Performance gap between generative and ID-based recommendation models is narrowed or eliminated, affirming the benefits of the generative approach.

Conclusion: Generative systems can rival ID-based models in recommendation tasks when combined with innovations like COSETTE and MARIUS, proving the viability of generative paradigms.

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

*Bahar Boroomand,James R. Wright*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-agnostic utility-based framework that uses pairwise comparisons rather than ratings or rankings to improve recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inability of traditional recommender systems to capture users' true preferences due to biases in ratings and the impracticality of eliciting full rankings.

Method: They developed a probabilistic Plackett-Luce framework for analyzing pairwise comparisons and devised an active sampling strategy to select optimal queries for preference elicitation. The framework supports task-specific utility functions.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved accuracy, data efficiency, and personalization in experiments involving movie recommendations and university admissions.

Conclusion: The proposed utility-based method offers a more flexible and user-focused approach to personalized ranking using pairwise comparisons.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

### [292] [M-$LLM^3$REC: A Motivation-Aware User-Item Interaction Framework for Enhancing Recommendation Accuracy with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15262)
*Lining Chen,Qingwen Zeng,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework leveraging large language models to improve recommendation systems in cold-start and sparse-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommendation systems face challenges like cold-start situations and sparse data which traditional methods struggle to address effectively.

Method: The paper proposes M-$LLM^3$REC, composed of MOPE, MOTE, and MAR modules, to extract deep motivational signals using large language models.

Result: M-$LLM^3$REC significantly enhances recommendation systems' performance, particularly in cold-start situations, compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates its effectiveness by delivering robust, personalized, and generalizable recommendations using motivation-driven semantic modeling.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

### [293] [Test-time Corpus Feedback: From Retrieval to RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15437)
*Mandeep Rathee,Venktesh V,Sean MacAvaney,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper provides a survey on advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, emphasizing the role of feedback in improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional RAG systems that treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, leading to inefficiencies in tasks requiring iterative or high-precision retrieval.

Method: A structured survey categorizing feedback signals by their source and role in enhancing query formulation, retrieved context, and document pool.

Result: A consolidated understanding of the developments in adaptive retrieval and ranking methods, bridging the gaps between information retrieval (IR) and NLP perspectives.

Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of treating retrieval as a dynamic and learnable component within RAG pipelines to improve end-to-end system performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

### [294] [MMQ: Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization Tokenization for Semantic ID Generation and User Behavioral Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15281)
*Yi Xu,Moyu Zhang,Chenxuan Li,Zhihao Liao,Haibo Xing,Hao Deng,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal recommender system framework called MMQ to enhance scalability, generalization, and recommendation quality by using semantic IDs instead of traditional item-based IDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve traditional recommender systems to handle scalability and sparse long-tail data by leveraging multimodal semantic IDs.

Method: The proposed framework MMQ uses a two-stage approach: shared-specific tokenizer for multimodal synergy and behavior-aware fine-tuning for aligning recommendations with user preferences.

Result: MMQ enhances multimodal synergy, specificity, and recommendation adaptability, evidenced by successful offline experiments and online A/B tests.

Conclusion: The research provides a scalable, versatile solution to overcome challenges in recommender systems using multimodal semantic IDs for retrieval and ranking tasks.

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

### [295] [A U-Statistic-based random forest approach for genetic interaction study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14924)
*Ming Li,Ruo-Sin Peng,Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces Forest U-Test, a U-Statistic-based random forest method for detecting joint associations in genetic studies of quantitative traits, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating strong results in Cannabis Dependence studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in complex traits due to the high-dimensionality and computational intensity of existing methods.

Method: The authors proposed Forest U-Test, a U-Statistic-based random forest technique, which effectively handles high-dimensional genetic data by identifying joint effects and interactions through recursive partitioning.

Result: Forest U-Test outperformed current methods in simulation studies and identified a significant joint association for Cannabis Dependence with highly significant p-values across three independent datasets.

Conclusion: The Forest U-Test method shows great promise as an effective tool for uncovering complex genetic associations and interactions in high-dimensional genetic studies of quantitative traits.

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

### [296] [AGP: A Novel Arabidopsis thaliana Genomics-Phenomics Dataset and its HyperGraph Baseline Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14934)
*Manuel Serna-Aguilera,Fiona L. Goggin,Aranyak Goswami,Alexander Bucksch,Suxing Liu,Khoa Luu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, a curated resource linking gene expression data with phenotypic trait data to facilitate genome-to-phenome research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the link between genes and traits is vital but remains challenging due to the fragmented nature of existing datasets and the heterogeneity of phenotype data.

Method: The authors present AGP, a curated multi-modal dataset that links genetic and phenotypic data for Arabidopsis thaliana. The dataset supports phenotype prediction and graph learning tasks, while benchmarks involve regression and biologically-informed hypergraph methods.

Result: AGP provides integrated multi-modal gene and phenotype data, offering a novel resource for exploring genome-to-phenome relationships in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Conclusion: The AGP dataset is expected to advance research on genotype-phenotype connections by offering a comprehensive and integrated dataset, thereby enabling more accurate predictions and insights.

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

### [297] [A Practical Guideline and Taxonomy to LLVM's Control Flow Integrity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15386)
*Sabine Houy,Bruno Kreyssig,Timothee Riom,Alexandre Bartel,Patrick McDaniel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLVMâs forward-edge CFI variants against memory corruption vulnerabilities, identifying strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory corruption vulnerabilities are critical threats, and while CFI offers mitigation, developers lack guidance on its practical application.

Method: The authors create a taxonomy linking LLVM's CFI variants to specific vulnerability classes, analyzing cases from the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list and testing against selected CVEs.

Result: CFI successfully blocked exploitation in two of the four CVEs analyzed but failed in the other two, revealing both its potential and limitations.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidance for incremental CFI deployment and a foundation for better practical application in real-world systems.

Abstract: Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to
software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code
execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,
developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to
real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's
forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering
actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in
existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one
representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and
explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other
two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support
informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the
practical use of CFI in production systems.

*Kaixiang Zhao,Lincan Li,Kaize Ding,Neil Zhenqiang Gong,Yue Zhao,Yushun Dong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms improve ML accessibility but introduce vulnerabilities like Model Extraction Attacks. This paper surveys such attacks, defenses, classification mechanisms, and their broader implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concern of vulnerabilities in MLaaS platforms, such as Model Extraction Attacks, due to their increased accessibility.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic survey and proposes a taxonomy to classify Model Extraction Attacks by mechanism, defenses, and computing environments.

Result: The study analyzes various attack techniques, the efficacy of defenses, and the trade-offs between model utility and security. It also discusses computing paradigms and broader technical, societal, ethical, and legal implications.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive resource for understanding Model Extraction Attacks and serves as a reference for stakeholders in AI security and privacy while advocating for future research directions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated
with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

### [299] [MoEcho: Exploiting Side-Channel Attacks to Compromise User Privacy in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15036)
*Ruyi Ding,Tianhong Xu,Xinyi Shen,Aidong Adam Ding,Yunsi Fei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents MoEcho, highlighting privacy vulnerabilities in Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture due to side channels in computation. It demonstrates specific attacks compromising user data in AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored privacy breaches in AI models using MoE architectures, which scale efficiently but pose inherent security risks.

Method: Introduce novel side channel vulnerabilities across CPU and GPU platforms and propose four specific attacks targeting privacy in LLMs and VLMs leveraging MoE.

Result: Four privacy breaching methodsâPrompt Inference, Response Reconstruction, Visual Inference, Visual Reconstructionâare demonstrated, showcasing significant risks in MoE systems.

Conclusion: MoEcho reveals the critical need for security in MoE-based architectures, urging preventative measures for emerging vulnerabilities in AI services.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

*Shiyi Yang,Xinshu Li,Guanglin Zhou,Chen Wang,Xiwei Xu,Liming Zhu,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGAN, a framework utilizing multimodal foundation models for generating imperceptible high-quality fake user profiles, effectively attacking recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks where malicious actors inject fake profiles to manipulate recommendations, depending on transferability and stealth under black-box settings.

Method: The paper employs in-context learning with multimodal models, using demonstration retrieval and text style transfer, alongside a collaborative optimization framework involving instructional agents and guardians.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets confirm RAGAN achieves state-of-the-art attack performance, improving both transferability and imperceptibility of fake profiles.

Conclusion: RAGAN provides insights into recommender system robustness and demonstrates effective generation of imperceptible fake profiles, advancing the understanding and challenge of poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

### [301] [IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310)
*Hengyu An,Jinghuai Zhang,Tianyu Du,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tao Lin,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPIGuard, a defensive mechanism against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI), and demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness in securing LLM agents' interactions with external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents face vulnerabilities when interacting with untrusted external data sources, exposing them to malicious outcomes caused by Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses are insufficient and lack structural constraints that prevent unrestricted tool invocations.

Method: The authors propose IPIGuard, which models the agent's task execution process as a traversal over a Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). This approach decouples action planning from external data interactions, reducing the risk of unintended tool invocations.

Result: Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard improves robustness against IPI attacks and balances effectiveness with the need for security.

Conclusion: IPIGuard enhances safety for LLM agents operating in dynamic environments, offering a promising direction for developing more secure artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

### [302] [MCPTox: A Benchmark for Tool Poisoning Attack on Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14925)
*Zhiqiang Wang,Yichao Gao,Yanting Wang,Suyuan Liu,Haifeng Sun,Haoran Cheng,Guanquan Shi,Haohua Du,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCPTox, the first benchmark to evaluate AI robustness against Tool Poisoning attacks in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), revealing widespread vulnerabilities and ineffective existing safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of systematic and large-scale evaluation of Tool Poisoning vulnerabilities in modern LLM-based autonomous agent ecosystems using MCP.

Method: The authors develop MCPTox using data from 45 real-world MCP servers and 353 tools, employing three distinct attack templates to generate 1312 malicious test cases across 10 risk categories. They evaluate 20 LLM agents on this benchmark using few-shot learning.

Result: The evaluation reveals a high vulnerability to Tool Poisoning attacks, with an attack success rate of up to 72.8%. Stronger models exhibit higher susceptibility to attacks due to better instruction-following capabilities. Refusal to participate in such attacks is rare, with the highest refusal rate being below 3%.

Conclusion: MCPTox provides a foundational dataset and empirical baseline for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in LLM agents interacting with untrusted tools. Existing safety protocols are inadequate, emphasizing the need for improved safeguards.

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

*Ehssan Mousavipour,Andrey Dimanchev,Majid Ghaderi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetSight is a framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that adapts to distribution shifts online without manual intervention, showing significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting anomaly detection systems to dynamic distribution shifts in network data without relying on manual labeling or clean data.

Method: NetSight employs pseudo-labeling for eliminating manual intervention and uses knowledge distillation for shift adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: NetSight outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 11.72% improvement in F1-score across three long-term network datasets.

Conclusion: NetSight is effective and robust for anomaly detection in dynamic networks, proving superior adaptability to distribution shifts without manual labeling or clean data inputs.

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

### [304] [BadFU: Backdoor Federated Learning through Adversarial Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15541)
*Bingguang Lu,Hongsheng Hu,Yuantian Miao,Shaleeza Sohail,Chaoxiang He,Shuo Wang,Xiao Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces BadFU, a backdoor attack targeting federated unlearning (FL), highlighting the vulnerability of FL systems to malicious unlearning requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the integration of machine unlearning in federated learning (FL), addressing the demands for data privacy and investigating potential security risks.

Method: The proposed method, BadFU, uses a malicious client's backdoor and camouflage samples to train the model. After requesting unlearning for the camouflage samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state.

Result: Extensive experiments across different FL frameworks and unlearning strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of the BadFU attack, revealing critical vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current federated unlearning practices are insecure and urges the development of more robust mechanisms to address these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-learning generative adversarial network (GAN) for robust X-ray phase retrieval using single intensity measurements without requiring training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phase contrast imaging techniques lack adaptability for diverse samples and setups, along with requiring manual tuning and approximations.

Method: The study employs a physics-informed GAN to autonomously reconstruct phase and absorbance information from a single X-ray hologram without training data.

Result: The method showed consistent high-quality phase and absorbance reconstruction across various experimental scenarios at PETRA III.

Conclusion: The presented GAN approach significantly enhances the utility and reliability of X-ray phase contrast imaging, overcoming previous limitations in data dependencies and adaptability.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the scalability and efficiency of spin-based quantum computing by improving the analysis and control of charge stability diagrams using advanced AI methods.

Method: An end-to-end learning framework with object detection transformers is implemented to identify and connect triple points in charge stability diagrams.

Result: The proposed method outperforms convolutional neural networks in multiple quantum dot architectures, generalizing across different spin qubit setups without retraining.

Conclusion: Transformer-based frameworks offer a scalable, generalized, and efficient solution for quantum dot device tuning and control.

Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly
revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply
object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in
semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with
spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points
and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge
state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it
surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin
qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to
existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime,
while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of
transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a
scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of
quantum dot devices.

*Wen-Fan Wang,Ting-Ying Lee,Chien-Ting Lu,Che-Wei Hsu,Nil Ponsa Campany,Yu Chen,Mike Y. Chen,Bing-Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GenTune is a human-AI collaborative tool for environment designers, enhancing prompt-image mapping and improving image refinement workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers face challenges with lengthy AI-generated prompts that are hard to revise and localized edits that compromise global coherence.

Method: GenTune enables designers to trace image elements back to prompt labels for precise revisions and globally consistent refinements.

Result: In a study with 20 designers, GenTune improved their workflow metrics such as comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency (statistically significant).

Conclusion: GenTune effectively addresses key challenges in AI-assisted design workflows and proves valuable in real-world studio settings.

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Motivation: Traditional interactive maps are limited by relying on structured GIS data and lack the ability to handle complex geo-visual inquiries.

Method: The authors propose leveraging geospatial image sources like Google Street View, TripAdvisor photos, and satellite imagery combined with GIS data to create multimodal AI agents.

Result: Three examples of Geo-Visual Agents are provided, demonstrating their ability to analyze and respond to complex geospatial questions.

Conclusion: Geo-Visual Agents represent a promising advancement in geospatial analysis, highlighting opportunities and challenges for future development.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modality-driven taxonomy for new foundation models in EEG analysis, addressing fragmentation in the research landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of foundation models in EEG analysis has created fragmentation due to varied roles, inconsistency in architectures, and lack of systematization.

Method: The study systematically categorizes advancements based on output modalities like EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and multimodal approaches.

Result: A taxonomy and comprehensive examination of research ideas, theoretical bases, and architectural innovations for modality-oriented EEG models were developed.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified framework to guide future research and enhance scalability, interpretability, and practical implementation of EEG foundation models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

TL;DR: AmbiSQL enhances Text-to-SQL systems by detecting ambiguities in natural language queries and guiding users to clarify their intent, resulting in better SQL accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query ambiguity hampers the accuracy of LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, necessitating an interactive approach to mitigate misinterpretations of user intent.

Method: The paper introduces AmbiSQL, which uses a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy to detect ambiguities, employs multiple-choice interaction to clarify user intent, and rewrites ambiguous questions based on user feedback.

Result: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in detecting ambiguities and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL significantly enhances Text-to-SQL system performance and usability, addressing ambiguity issues through interactive user clarification and earning practical applicability.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

*Mengze Wang,Benedikt Barthel Sorensen,Themistoklis Sapsis*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEN2, an efficient computational model for predicting climate extremes, leveraging machine learning and statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth System Models face computational challenges in simulating the wide range of climate extremes and emission scenarios, necessitating a more efficient and accurate approach.

Method: GEN2 utilizes a two-step framework: a conditional Gaussian emulator for initial predictions and a non-Gaussian machine learning correction trained on nudged reference data, ensuring robustness against chaotic climate systems.

Result: The model was validated using historical ERA5 datasets and demonstrated strong extrapolation capabilities for predicting extreme climate events under various future warming scenarios, even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: GEN2 shows promise as a computationally efficient and reliable tool for forecasting extreme climate conditions across diverse scenarios, outperforming traditional models in adaptability and accuracy.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

*Guilherme V. Moura,AndrÃ© P. Santos,Hudson S. Torrent*

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of machine learning (ML) in optimizing portfolio selection by identifying relevant firm-level variables, demonstrating significant risk reductions and improved performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the potential of ML in enhancing portfolio selection by addressing the limitations of traditional sparse methods and fully utilizing a large dataset of firm-level characteristics.

Method: The paper parameterizes minimum-variance portfolio weights using ML on 4,610 predictors, including firm-level characteristics and non-linear transformations. It compares the results with traditional sparse methods.

Result: The study reveals that ML significantly improves portfolio risk reduction when selecting predictors, particularly using non-linear terms, and it also finds predictors that enhance both risk reduction and returns.

Conclusion: ML-driven variable selection outperforms ad-hoc sparse methods, suggesting that traditional sparsity constraints may harm minimum-variance portfolios' effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully employed in identifying
variables that can predict the equity premium of individual stocks. In this
paper, we investigate if ML can also be helpful in selecting variables relevant
for optimal portfolio choice. To address this question, we parameterize
minimum-variance portfolio weights as a function of a large pool of firm-level
characteristics as well as their second-order and cross-product
transformations, yielding a total of 4,610 predictors. We find that the gains
from employing ML to select relevant predictors are substantial:
minimum-variance portfolios achieve lower risk relative to sparse
specifications commonly considered in the literature, especially when
non-linear terms are added to the predictor space. Moreover, some of the
selected predictors that help decreasing portfolio risk also increase returns,
leading to minimum-variance portfolios with good performance in terms of Shape
ratios in some situations. Our evidence suggests that ad-hoc sparsity can be
detrimental to the performance of minimum-variance characteristics-based
portfolios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to overcome computational and memory challenges posed by current GNN architectures, particularly Interaction Networks, when deployed on FPGAs for real-time applications like CERN's HL-LHC.

Method: The authors developed JEDI-linear, a GNN architecture that removes explicit pairwise interactions using global aggregation and shared transformations. Additionally, they optimized hardware efficiency with quantization-aware training and distributed arithmetic.

Result: JEDI-linear yields significantly lower latency (by 3.7 to 11.5 times), reduced initiation intervals, and lower resource usage (by up to 6.2 times for LUTs) compared to existing solutions. It also achieves higher accuracy and eliminates reliance on DSP blocks.

Conclusion: This work presents the first interaction-based GNN capable of meeting sub-60 ns latency requirements for real-time systems, paving the way for efficient GNN deployment in scientific applications. Open-sourced templates enhance reproducibility and application scope.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the control of propeller motion of a devil-stick with impulsive forces and proposes novel methods for solving this problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the orbital stabilization problem for underactuated robotic juggling, specifically the propeller motion of a devil-stick, which has not been previously studied.

Method: Introduced the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) and derived discrete zero dynamics (DZD). Developed controllers for DVHC enforcement and orbit stabilization using the impulse-controlled PoincarÃ© map approach.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated success in trajectory design and stabilization of the devil-stick propeller motion through simulations.

Conclusion: Discrete holonomic constraints effectively provide stability conditions for underactuated juggling, paving the way for further study in robotic juggling control.

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework using multiscale dynamics for efficient sampling from complex unnormalised distributions, eliminating reliance on learned score functions or nested MCMC loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and simplicity of sampling methods for complex distributions, addressing the computational challenges associated with traditional score-based and MCMC-based techniques.

Method: The framework employs slow-fast stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for intermediate score estimation without training or inner-loop MCMC, introducing algorithms MultALMC and MultCDiff with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that these methods handle multimodal and high-dimensional distributions well, achieving accuracy and efficiency without requiring learned models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a competitive alternative to existing samplers and offers theoretical and practical advancements for sampling from challenging distributions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex,
unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics.
Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations
of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages
stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without
training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework:
MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff,
based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are
considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion
path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions
using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics.
Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including
multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed
methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, without the need for learned models.

Motivation: To understand how local non-equilibrium systems can retain information for long time scales against disruptions and expand the known frameworks.

Method: The authors combine rigorous mathematical proofs with machine learning techniques to identify and analyze new two-dimensional many-body memory systems.

Result: They discovered multiple novel memory dynamics distinct from Toom's rule, including those requiring noise, exploiting fluctuations, and resistant to perturbations.

Conclusion: Many-body systems can sustain robust information storage in diverse and richer ways, with implications for understanding physical memory dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine-learning framework using Flow Matching to address limitations in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, enabling efficient and scalable simulation of physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the scalability challenges of MCMC methods and improve computational efficiency in studying complex many-body systems.

Method: The proposed method uses Flow Matching, training a CNN on small lattice configurations to learn a continuous, temperature-dependent mapping that generalizes across lattice sizes and temperatures.

Result: The framework successfully generated samples for a larger system ($128\times 128$) using a network trained on a smaller system ($32\times 32$), accurately capturing thermodynamic observables and critical phenomena like the BKT transition.

Conclusion: The "train-small, generate-large" capability offers a scalable and efficient approach for simulating many-body systems, with potential applications to other classical and quantum systems.

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for conformal predictive inference that accommodates coarsened or incomplete training data, leveraging semiparametric theory and modern machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The majority of current Conformal Prediction methods assume fully observed training data, a condition often violated in real-world applications where data may be incomplete or censored.

Method: The authors derive efficient influence functions and introduce a conformal risk control procedure to handle coarsened data. They also incorporate machine learning techniques like random forests to estimate nuisance functions of the semiparametric model.

Result: The proposed framework provides prediction intervals that maintain validity under challenging scenarios such as covariate shift and monotone missingness. Simulation studies further demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The new approach enhances the practicality and robustness of conformal prediction methods by expanding their applicability to datasets with incomplete or censored information.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has recently received a tremendous amount of
interest, leading to a wide range of new theoretical and methodological results
for predictive inference with formal theoretical guarantees. However, the vast
majority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully
observed data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an
assumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often
missing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In
addition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to
dropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such
coarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of
well-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and
efficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of
obtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given
coarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve
our goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the
outcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened
data, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our
principled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating
flexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the
underlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward
application of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals
with stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the
construction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness
scenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various
simulation studies.

Result: Identified 5,304 counterexamples among 20,160 matrices (26.3%) and found matrix density predictive of expressibility with 95.7% accuracy. Discovered a low-dimensional algebraic structure for expressible matrices.

Conclusion: Expressible matrices are constrained by deep algebraic properties, forming a low-dimensional variety within a higher-dimensional space.

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

*Hadrien Pujol,Matteo Bevillacqua,Christophe Thirard,Thierry Mazoyer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A lightweight neural network was developed to improve gunshot detection in noisy environments for military vehicles, doubling detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect and locate shooters on battlefields using microphone arrays, limiting noise interference in moving vehicles.

Method: Combines a two-layer perceptron neural network with advanced signal processing techniques for denoising.

Result: Successfully doubled the detection rate of muzzle blast waveforms amidst comparable noise levels.

Conclusion: The lightweight model enhances detection performance efficiently in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

*Ilya Fedorov,Dmitry Korobchenko*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores dynamic speech emotion recognition, focusing on emotional 3D avatar animations. It introduces a novel Dirichlet-based emotional mixture model, improved with human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech emotion recognition methods ignore the dynamic, sequential nature of emotions within audio tracks. The study seeks to address this gap, particularly for animating emotional 3D avatars.

Method: The authors propose a multi-stage approach: train a speech emotion recognition model, generate synthetic emotional sequences, model emotional mixtures using Dirichlet distribution, and refine models with human feedback.

Result: Experimental results indicate that Dirichlet-based models are more effective at capturing emotional mixtures compared to the sliding window approach. Human feedback enhances model quality and simplifies annotation.

Conclusion: The Dirichlet-based emotional modeling, paired with human feedback, successfully improves dynamic speech emotion recognition, benefiting applications like emotional 3D avatars.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an XAI-driven methodology for analyzing cough sound spectrograms to distinguish respiratory diseases, with notable findings for COPD patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and diagnostic potential of cough sound analysis in respiratory disease management using interpretable AI techniques.

Method: Utilized occlusion maps and CNNs to identify disease-relevant spectral features in cough spectrograms, followed by spectral analysis for feature extraction.

Result: Occlusion maps revealed spectral differences specific to disease groups, enhancing discrimination capabilities, especially for COPD patients.

Conclusion: XAI techniques can provide interpretable insights into disease-specific acoustic patterns, advancing cough sound analysis for diagnostic purposes.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

*Guirui Zhong,Qing Wang,Jun Du,Lei Wang,Mingqi Cai,Xin Fang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel audio features and a parameter-free feature enhancement strategy to improve Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD faces challenges such as uncertainty in anomaly location and redundant information (e.g., noise) in machine sounds.

Method: The authors propose filter banks with evenly distributed intervals for equal attention to all frequency ranges and a parameter-free feature enhancement strategy using pre-trained models.

Result: The proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in ASD performance on the DCASE 2024 Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: Filter banks and a parameter-free strategy enhance anomaly detection effectiveness and transfer universal knowledge from pre-trained models to ASD tasks.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HEAS is a Python framework for unified layered agent-based modeling, evolutionary optimization, and tournament evaluation, offering reproducible workflows and versatile tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust, standardized platform for multi-level agent-based modeling, evolutionary tasks, and reproducible studies in various domains.

Method: HEAS integrates hierarchical modeling with deterministic layers, shared contexts, APIs, CLI tools, PyTorch parameter handling, and standardized evaluation to streamline simulations, optimizations, and comparisons.

Result: The paper demonstrates that HEAS simplifies workflows, reduces coding efforts, and ensures cross-study reproducibility through examples in ecology and enterprise decision-making.

Conclusion: HEAS provides a versatile and reliable foundation for cross-disciplinary inquiries, enhancing the reproducibility and comparability of agent-based simulations.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

### [325] [Disentangling the Drivers of LLM Social Conformity: An Uncertainty-Moderated Dual-Process Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14918)
*Huixin Zhong,Yanan Liu,Qi Cao,Shijin Wang,Zijing Ye,Zimu Wang,Shiyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper studies social conformity in large language models (LLMs), focusing on how uncertainty affects alignment with majority opinions and distinguishing between informational and normative influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the psychological mechanisms driving LLMs' conforming behaviors and determine whether they parallel human social behaviors in uncertain decision-making scenarios.

Method: The study employed an information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to examine nine LLMs' decision-making under varying levels of uncertainty and across different domains (medical, legal, investment).

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs predominantly use informational influence for decision-making, but their behavior changes with uncertainty; low-to-medium uncertainty leads to underweighting evidence, while high uncertainty causes an over-reliance on public signals.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while LLMs rely on rational processing mechanisms similar to humans, uncertainty significantly shifts their decision-making balance, potentially leading to normative-like biases in high uncertainty scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Motivation: To integrate AI-related competencies into higher education curricula in response to its growing impact on professional practices.

Method: The study employs a mixed methods approachâquantitative curriculum mapping and qualitative focus group interviewsâto assess stakeholder perceptions on curriculum aspects like quality and industry alignment.

Result: The study identifies outcomes of interdisciplinary curriculum development, examines stakeholder perceptions of quality, and reveals how educator participation influences these perceptions.

Conclusion: The findings advance AI education by providing insights for developing interdisciplinary curricula that address evolving industry needs.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

### [328] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic normalization framework for narrative knowledge graphs in comics to improve coherence and eliminate redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding comics and visual narratives requires structured representations, but current symbolic narrative graphs often suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors use lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering to consolidate semantically related actions and events, thereby normalizing hierarchical narrative graphs while preserving interpretability.

Result: Experiments on manga stories from the Manga109 dataset show that semantic normalization enhances coherence, robustness, and symbolic transparency across narrative levels.

Conclusion: Semantic normalization is crucial for scalable narrative graph models, enabling better comprehension and reasoning in multimodal narrative understanding.

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

Motivation: The limitations of existing representations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility in neuromorphic event video research motivate the need for a new unified representation and improved visualization tools.

Method: The authors suggest improvements to the existing ADÎER representation and enhance the adder-viz software for visualizing real-time transcoding processes related to event videos.

Result: Development of a centralized, MIT-licensed software repository for adder-viz that supports improved visualization and integration of event video transcoding applications.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the neuromorphic video research field by improving tools for real-time event processing, making them more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study proposes using per-pixel label confidence values in training AI models for medical imaging, specifically for lung ultrasound, to address label uncertainty and improve segmentation and clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-observer variability among radiologists introduces label uncertainty, making it challenging to produce consistent annotations in subjective imaging modalities like lung ultrasound.

Method: The authors devised a data annotation protocol capturing radiologist confidence in labeled regions and trained AI models using these per-pixel confidence values, exploring various confidence thresholds, particularly 60%.

Result: Incorporating confidence values improved segmentation performance and downstream clinical tasks such as estimating S/F oxygenation ratio, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission.

Conclusion: Leveraging label confidence significantly enhances AI reliability and clinical utility, with high-confidence thresholds proving far more effective than naive approaches.

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tongue image segmentation research has limitations and lacks robust, user-friendly tools, hindering effective intelligent tongue diagnosis systems in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

Method: The authors proposed TOM, a tongue segmentation model leveraging multi-teacher knowledge distillation and diffusion-based data augmentation to improve generalization, reduce parameter size, and enhance segmentation performance.

Result: TOM reduced model parameters by 96.6%, achieving 95.22% mIoU segmentation accuracy. The model was also deployed as online and offline freely accessible tools for non-programmers.

Conclusion: Better data segmentation improves TCM constitution classification performance and interpretability. TOM addresses a research gap and provides the first open-source tongue image segmentation tool in TCM.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Conclusion: The study introduces a promising low-latency format for transmitting asynchronous pixel samples effectively, filling a gap in event-sensor data streaming.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional

Motivation: High-resolution CT imaging is crucial for clinical diagnosis but poses radiation risks, making it challenging to acquire directly; thus, super-resolution methods are needed.

Method: The framework leverages high-resolution 2D X-ray projections generated by a diffusion model, adaptive generative sampling, and Gaussian splatting with the proposed NAB-GS approach for enhanced 3D CT reconstruction.

Result: The method outperformed existing approaches in quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two datasets for 3D CT super-resolution.

Conclusion: Using external high-resolution priors from diffusion-based 2D X-ray data, the approach significantly improves 3D CT super-resolution and anatomical detail recovery while eliminating dependence on paired data.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method in digital pathology using a vision-language model integrated with a diffusion model, tested on gastric and breast lymph node datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient and effective disease diagnosis in digital pathology without relying on extensively annotated datasets, especially due to data scarcity.

Method: The researchers integrated a vision-language model with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. Pathology-related keywords are used as prompts during the reconstruction process to differentiate between normal and abnormal tissues.

Result: Experiments were conducted on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and further generalized to a public breast lymph node dataset. The method demonstrated promise in detecting anomalies across multiple datasets and domains.

Conclusion: The proposed approach highlights its potential in unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, showing adaptability across different organs and datasets.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal
choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the
importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces DoSReMC, a framework targeting domain shift issues in mammography classification, aiming to enhance cross-domain generalization without retraining full models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address performance drops in deep learning-based breast cancer classification models caused by domain shift, ensuring safe and fair deployment in clinical environments.

Method: DoSReMC adapts batch normalization (BN) and fully connected (FC) layers of CNNs without retraining the convolutional filters. It incorporates adversarial training for improved cross-domain generalizability.

Result: The study shows BN layers as a significant source of domain dependence and demonstrates improved cross-domain generalization of mammography classification using DoSReMC with three large datasets.

Conclusion: DoSReMC provides a practical solution for enhancing mammography classification models' resilience across diverse clinical domains, ensuring robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

### [340] [Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553)
*Jin Ye,Jingran Wang,Fengchao Xiong,Jingzhou Chen,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) model for hyperspectral image denoising by leveraging deep equilibrium models and advanced sparse coding techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising faces challenges due to complex noise patterns and the need to preserve physical properties during processing.

Method: The DECSC model combines deep equilibrium concepts with convolutional sparse coding, integrating 2D and 3D sparse representations, a transformer block for spatial self-similarity, and a detail enhancement module.

Result: The DECSC model delivers superior HSI denoising performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed DECSC framework successfully integrates spatial-spectral correlations, self-similarities, and global consistency to advance robust HSI denoising solutions.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Ana C. Perre,LuÃ­s A. Alexandre,LuÃ­s C. Freire*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores generating dual-energy subtracted (DES) images from low-energy (LE) images using different models to mitigate radiation exposure in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the potential to reduce patient exposure to the radiation involved in acquiring DES images in CESM.

Method: The methods included applying three models: a pre-trained U-Net, an end-to-end trained U-Net, and a CycleGAN. Evaluations were carried out to study the generated virtual DES images' impact on malignant vs. non-malignant classification.

Result: The pre-trained U-Net model achieved the best performance in generating virtual DES images, showing an F1 score of 85.59%, compared to 90.35% with real DES images.

Conclusion: While virtual DES images are not yet as diagnostically informative as real DES images, this approach holds promise for future clinical adoption.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of GANs for super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI to improve near-wall velocity measurements, showing that the Wasserstein GAN offers better stability and performance under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of 4D Flow MRI, including low spatial resolution and noise, particularly for near-wall velocity measurements, by exploring the potential of GAN-based super-resolution.

Method: The study uses a dedicated GAN architecture for super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI, trained and validated on patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models converted into MR-true synthetic images. Three adversarial loss functions (Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein) were tested and compared.

Result: The Wasserstein GAN demonstrated the best performance and stability, achieving lower vNRMSE (6.9%) compared to non-adversarial and other GAN-based methods, especially in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio.

Conclusion: GAN-based super-resolution, particularly using Wasserstein GANs, has significant potential for improving near-wall velocity recovery in 4D Flow MRI. However, careful selection of adversarial strategies is critical for stable and effective implementation.

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

*Paul Fischer,Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Thomas KÃ¼stner,Christian Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware MRI acquisition method that modifies scan times based on individual needs, aiming to reduce duration and improve diagnostic precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scans have long acquisition times and fixed acceleration factors can lead to either overly prolonged or poor-quality scans, limiting clinical efficacy.

Method: The authors introduced a dynamic framework using probabilistic reconstruction to estimate image uncertainty, combined with conformal prediction to set confidence intervals. The system adaptively acquires data until precision requirements are met.

Result: Validation on knee and cardiac MRI datasets showed reduced scan times compared to fixed protocols while maintaining precise diagnostic metrics through calibrated statistical guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework enables more efficient, patient-specific MRI scans, balancing scan duration and diagnostic confidence, advancing personalized and resource-optimized imaging.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HessNet, a lightweight neural network for 3D segmentation of brain vessels, addressing the lack of annotated datasets while achieving state-of-the-art results with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accuracy and resource efficiency in brain blood vessel segmentation for medical procedures, overcoming the limitations of manual methods and the scarcity of annotated datasets.

Method: The paper presents HessNet, a semi-supervised learning neural network utilizing Hessian matrices, consisting of 6000 parameters and designed for resource-efficient segmentation on CPUs.

Result: HessNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy using a minimal training dataset and enables the creation of a high-quality brain vessel dataset annotated by experts.

Conclusion: HessNet provides an accurate, lightweight, and resource-efficient solution for brain vessel segmentation and supports the development of a valuable annotated dataset for wider use.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: DeCoDi is a debiasing method for text-to-image diffusion models, achieving effective bias mitigation without reducing image quality or requiring high computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in text-to-image generative models, particularly along demographic traits like gender, ethnicity, and age.

Method: DeCoDi modifies the inference procedure in diffusion models to avoid biased latent dimensions, without altering the model architecture or training process.

Result: Evaluation with human and automated assessments showed DeCoDi mitigates biases effectively while maintaining image diversity and quality.

Conclusion: DeCoDi offers a lightweight yet effective approach to debias diffusion-based generative models, improving their representation diversity without significant computational demands.

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GenSIM, a generative AI-based pan-Arctic sea-ice model that predicts sea-ice properties with high accuracy and efficiency within a 12-hour window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing numerical models of sea-ice dynamics are limited by high computational costs, especially for ensemble forecasting and long-term climate simulations.

Method: The authors developed GenSIM, an AI-based model trained on data from a state-of-the-art sea-ice-ocean system. The model predicts sea-ice concentration, thickness, and drift based on atmospheric forcing.

Result: GenSIM achieves improved accuracy in short-term predictions compared to deterministic models, reproduces sea-ice dynamics, and exhibits emergent extrapolation capabilities for long-term climate trends without direct oceanic input.

Conclusion: GenSIM demonstrates the potential of AI generative models to improve efficiency and accuracy in predicting sea-ice dynamics, simultaneously inferring hidden physical patterns and generalizing to unseen climates.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

*Zhongwei Zhang,Erich Fischer,Jakob Zscheischler,Sebastian Engelke*

TL;DR: AI-based models surpass traditional numerical weather prediction systems in benchmarks, but struggle with forecasting record-breaking weather extremes compared to the HRES model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of AI weather models in forecasting unprecedented extreme weather events, especially in light of a warming climate.

Method: The study compares forecast errors of leading AI models like GraphCast, Pangu-Weather, Fuxi, and their operational versions against the performance of the numerical High RESolution forecast (HRES) for record-breaking heat, cold, and wind events.

Result: AI models exhibit consistently larger errors for extreme weather events compared to HRES, underestimating frequency/intensity of hot records and overestimating cold records.

Conclusion: AI weather models currently face limitations in extrapolation and forecasting extreme weather events, requiring further rigorous model validation and development before high-stakes applications like disaster management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

Motivation: AI systems may behave strategically and evaluations need to account for this to better understand their deployment behavior.

Method: The paper uses examples from existing AI systems, a review of related studies, and formal game-theoretic analysis of evaluation scenarios to support its claims.

Result: Evidence supports the claim that accounting for strategic AI behavior and game-theoretic methods can improve evaluation effectiveness.

Conclusion: Incorporating strategic reasoning and game-theoretic approaches in AI evaluation leads to more robust and informative safety cases.

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

### [349] [Mitigating context switching in densely packed Linux clusters with Latency-Aware Group Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15703)
*Al Amjad Tawfiq Isstaif,Evangelia Kalyvianaki,Richard Mortier*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: Cluster performance is degraded in dense workloads due to CPU context switching overheads, wasting resources through over-provisioning. Modifications to Linux's scheduler significantly improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address degraded cluster performance caused by CPU context switching overheads in densely packed workloads such as serverless applications.

Method: The study identifies the underlying causes of overheads and proposes modifications to the Linux kernel scheduler to prioritize task completion over fairness, reducing switching overheads.

Result: Evaluations show that the proposed scheduler modifications achieve the same performance with 28% smaller cluster size.

Conclusion: Mitigating context switching issues through scheduler changes can eliminate the need for over-provisioning, optimizing resource utilization and performance in dense workloads.

Abstract: Cluster orchestrators such as Kubernetes depend on accurate estimates of node
capacity and job requirements. Inaccuracies in either lead to poor placement
decisions and degraded cluster performance. In this paper, we show that in
densely packed workloads, such as serverless applications, CPU context
switching overheads can become so significant that a node's performance is
severely degraded, even when the orchestrator placement is theoretically sound.
In practice this issue is typically mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster,
leading to wasted resources.
  We show that these context switching overhead arise from both an increase in
the average cost of an individual context switch and a higher rate of context
switching, which together amplify overhead multiplicatively when managing large
numbers of concurrent cgroups, Linux's group scheduling mechanism for managing
multi-threaded colocated workloads. We propose and evaluate modifications to
the standard Linux kernel scheduler that mitigate these effects, achieving the
same effective performance with a 28% smaller cluster size. The key insight
behind our approach is to prioritise task completion over low-level per-task
fairness, enabling the scheduler to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly
and thereby reduce time spent on context switching.

TL;DR: This paper presents a compilation framework for distributed quantum computing (DQC) with heterogeneous quantum processing units (QPUs), achieving up to an 88.40% improvement in objective value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQC with heterogeneous QPUs poses challenges due to varying structures, necessitating better approaches for efficient quantum program mapping.

Method: The authors propose a framework using three strategies: exploiting circuit patterns, clustering for qubit placement, and annealing algorithms for mapping adjustments.

Result: The framework demonstrates capability in handling complex heterogeneous quantum systems and achieves an objective value reduction of up to 88.40% compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an effective solution to efficiently map quantum programs in DQC environments, addressing heterogeneity and optimizing performance.

Abstract: Efficiently mapping quantum programs onto Distributed quantum computing (DQC)
are challenging, particularly when considering the heterogeneous quantum
processing units (QPUs) with different structures. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive compilation framework that addresses these challenges with three
key insights: exploiting structural patterns within quantum circuits, using
clustering for initial qubit placement, and adjusting qubit mapping with
annealing algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods and the capability to handle complex heterogeneous distributed quantum
systems. Our evaluation shows that our method reduces the objective value at
most 88.40\% compared to the baseline.

### [351] [SVM/SVR Kernels as Quantum Propagators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153)
*Nan-Hong Kuo,Renata Wong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper connects Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels with quantum propagators represented through Greenâs functions and introduces a Kernel Polynomial Method to create customized kernels, enhancing SVM accuracy in physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the unexplored mathematical equivalence between SVM kernel functions and quantum propagators through Greenâs functions, aiming to leverage this for improved model accuracy in SVMs.

Method: The authors identify a natural correspondence between SVM kernels and Greenâs functions using operator inversion theory, introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernel functions, and conduct numerical experiments for validation.

Result: The numerical experiments confirm that positive semidefinite kernels corresponding to Greenâs functions boost the predictive accuracy of SVM models for physical systems.

Conclusion: Green's functions can serve as robust SVM kernels, and the Kernel Polynomial Method further facilitates the creation of effective, domain-specific kernels, enhancing SVM performance in applications involving physical systems.

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir computing algorithm, leveraging discrete time crystal dynamics to overcome obstacles in trainability and noise robustness in quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental challenges in trainability and noise robustness of quantum variational algorithms in quantum machine learning.

Method: It relies on quantum reservoir computing using discrete time crystal dynamics and evaluates its performance through binary and multi-class classification tasks. The approach leverages quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions.

Result: Noisy simulations and experiments on superconducting quantum processors demonstrated improved classification accuracy with increasing system size, exhibiting topological noise robustness.

Conclusion: This work pioneers experimental quantum reservoir computing for image classification via digital quantum simulation, linking quantum phase transitions to machine learning performance, and proposing new principles for NISQ-era quantum computing algorithms.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

*Sunkalp Chandra*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The study compares six machine learning classifiers to predict hazardous near-Earth objects. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting exhibited the highest performance with outstanding accuracy and F2-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore automated methods for accurately predicting hazardous NEOs using machine learning.

Method: A binary classification framework was used to evaluate six classifiers (RFC, GBC, SVC, LDA, LR, KNN) through data scaling, power transformation, cross-validation, and confusion matrix analysis.

Result: RFC and GBC achieved the best results with F2-scores around 0.98 and accuracy rates above 99.6%, while KNN performed the worst. SVC performed moderately well, and LDA and LR exhibited moderate scores around 0.74.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods like RFC and GBC are highly effective for high precision and recall in NEO classification. Future research should focus on hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial random forests (ARF) as a method for generating synthetic epidemiological data and validates its effectiveness by replicating findings from six epidemiological studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of limited quality, computational complexity, and low statistical utility in synthetic data generation for epidemiological research.

Method: Propose using adversarial random forests (ARF) for synthesizing epidemiological data and evaluate its utility by comparing synthetic data results with original findings across six studies.

Result: Synthetic data reliably replicated key findings from six epidemiological publications across various analyses, even for datasets with low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generated using ARF successfully reproduces epidemiological findings, with enhanced quality achieved by reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study aimed to classify primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) patients as slow or fast progressors of the disease using a combined approach of optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and visual field (VF) functional parameters, achieving better classification with a Random Forest machine learning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the need to improve the monitoring and prediction of disease progression in PACG patients, focusing on identifying slow versus fast progressors using an integrated analysis of structural and functional data.

Method: The method involved combining structural data from OCT-measured ONH parameters with functional VF sensitivity data. These were input into machine learning classifiers, particularly Random Forest, and key predictors were identified using SHAP analysis.

Result: The best predictive model was a Random Forest classifier integrating structural and functional features, achieving an AUC of 0.87. Key predictors included inferior MRW, inferior RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, and superior nasal VF sensitivity.

Conclusion: Combining ONH structural features with VF functional parameters significantly improves the classification of disease progression risk in PACG patients. Structural features, particularly those related to ONH morphology, play a critical role in monitoring progression.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

*Mehdi Yazdani-Jahromi,Ali Khodabandeh Yalabadi,Ozlem Ozmen Garibay*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper presents Equi-mRNA, an mRNA language model leveraging group-theoretic priors to encode synonymous codon symmetries, improving tasks like expression prediction and sequence generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for models that capture latent structures in synonymous codon usage, vital for translation efficiency and gene expression modulation.

Method: Equi-mRNA uses group-theoretic priors, an equivariance loss, and symmetry-aware pooling to explicitly encode codon symmetries associated with 2D Special Orthogonal matrices (SO(2)).

Result: Equi-mRNA achieved up to 10% accuracy improvements in property prediction tasks, produced up to 4x more realistic sequences, and better preserved functional properties, alongside novel interpretability insights.

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA advances codon-level modeling with biologically principled approaches, offering impactful applications for mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology.

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.
