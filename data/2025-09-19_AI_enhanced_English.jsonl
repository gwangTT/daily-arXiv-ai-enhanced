As the need for intelligence\ngrows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,\ndeploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always\nfeasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and\nCommunication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.\nWithin ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses\nwireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with\nexisting communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are\nlimited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum\naccuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we\nsee a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage\narea. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a\nMultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.\nFAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information\nfrom Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical\nworld without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,\nwe have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario.
