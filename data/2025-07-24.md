### [1] [Towards Autonomous Sustainability Assessment via Multimodal AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17012)
*Zhihan Zhang,Alexander Metzger,Yuxuan Mei,Felix Hähnlein,Zachary Englhardt,Tingyu Cheng,Gregory D. Abowd,Shwetak Patel,Adriana Schulz,Vikram Iyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces multimodal AI agents to streamline and improve life cycle assessments (LCA), drastically reducing time consumption and improving accuracy in calculating carbon emissions for electronic products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LCAs are limited by a lack of data availability and the extensive time required for manual expert analysis, making sustainability assessments inefficient and often incomplete.

Method: The authors propose multimodal AI agents that interact like LCA experts, leveraging data abstraction and tools to extract information from online sources and certifications. These agents use clustering and emission factor approximation for efficient and accurate calculations.

Result: The AI agents reduced analysis time from weeks to under a minute and delivered carbon footprint estimates within 19% of expert LCAs using zero proprietary data. Additionally, they achieved a MAPE of 12.28% in predicting emissions for electronic products and improved emission factor accuracy by 120.26%.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances LCA workflows by closing data gaps, accelerating assessments, and improving estimation accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for sustainability analysis in product development.

Abstract: Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However,
the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and
processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts
(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing
multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and
stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the
cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI
agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom
data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text
and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach
reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data
availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of
expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to
directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with
similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop
with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven
method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown
material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar
materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,
this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this
approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.

### [2] [New Mechanisms in Flex Distribution for Bounded Suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17054)
*Shao-Hung Chan,Thomy Phan,Jiaoyang Li,Sven Koenig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces new flex distribution mechanisms to enhance the performance of EECBS in bounded-suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in the current flex distribution mechanism in EECBS, which affects its ability to resolve collisions effectively and retain efficiency.

Method: Three new flex distribution mechanisms are proposed: Conflict-Based Flex Distribution, Delay-Based Flex Distribution, and Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, which combines the former two in a hierarchical framework.

Result: The paper proves that these new mechanisms are complete and ensure bounded-suboptimality. Experimental results show significant performance improvement over the original (greedy) flex distribution mechanism.

Conclusion: The proposed flex distribution mechanisms offer a more efficient and effective solution to resolve collisions, making EECBS faster and better-suited for bounded-suboptimal MAPF scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of
collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective
is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent
is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.
Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for
bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a
user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and
a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of
paths whose SOC is at most $w \cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve
collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its
optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually
bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower
bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up
EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though
EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,
increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \cdot LB$, forcing EECBS
to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a
particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,
we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion
to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy
constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we
propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical
framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is
complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches
outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.

### [3] [LoRA is All You Need for Safety Alignment of Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17075)
*Yihao Xue,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents using LoRA-based fine-tuning to improve reasoning abilities while maintaining safety alignment in language models, addressing reasoning degradation issues seen with traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counteract the "Safety Tax," where fine-tuning for safety alignment harms reasoning capabilities, and to ensure LLMs remain effective yet safe.

Method: The authors leverage LoRA, a low-rank adaptation technique, for safety fine-tuning. They limit the safety weight updates to a low-dimensional space to minimize interference with reasoning parameters.

Result: Through experiments spanning benchmarks in math, science, and coding, the proposed LoRA-based method effectively maintains reasoning abilities while achieving safety alignment comparable to full-model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LoRA is a promising method for addressing the reasoning-safety trade-off, and further exploration of weight redundancy reduction could enhance performance in specific tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex
problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with
harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the
post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been
shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the
"Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets
effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning
capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a
low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our
extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding
show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels
comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with
smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We
also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or
during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope
this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent
improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.

### [4] [HySafe-AI: Hybrid Safety Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17118)
*Mandar Pitale,Jelena Frtunikj,Abhinaw Priyadershi,Vasu Singh,Maria Spence*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the safety of AI systems like autonomous driving using traditional methods, introduces an improved hybrid framework, and suggests future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI is increasingly used in safety-critical systems, necessitating robust safety evaluations, especially for complex models like LLMs and VLMs.

Method: The authors assess traditional safety analysis approaches (FMEA, FTA) and propose HySAFE-AI, a hybrid framework tailored for foundational AI systems.

Result: HySAFE-AI adapts existing safety evaluation techniques to address challenges posed by intricate AI architectures and latent representations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a refined safety analysis framework and strategic insights for developing future AI safety standards.

Abstract: AI has become integral to safety-critical areas like autonomous driving
systems (ADS) and robotics. The architecture of recent autonomous systems are
trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large
language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we
review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of
common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and
fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the
intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and
utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety
Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts
traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer
hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety
standards.

### [5] [Improving LLMs' Generalized Reasoning Abilities by Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17168)
*Qifan Zhang,Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Miao Peng,Jing Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) and a new corpus, GraphPile, to train LLMs, improving reasoning tasks across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with novel and complex reasoning tasks, and current domain-specific pretraining methods lack transferability.

Method: The authors propose using Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) tasks coupled with GraphPile, a large-scale graph-based dataset, for continued domain-specific pretraining.

Result: GraphMind, trained using GraphPile on models like Llama and Gemma, achieves up to 4.9% better accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 21.2% improvement in other reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Harnessing GPR in combination with the new GraphPile dataset enhances the reasoning adaptability and robustness of LLMs across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks,
yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems.
Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for
mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader
reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning
(GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks,
spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological
reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them
ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce
GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR
data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes
chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph
data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and
3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in
mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical
reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first
to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first
dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific
pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability
and robustness of LLMs.

### [7] [Agent Identity Evals: Measuring Agentic Identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17257)
*Elija Perrier,Michael Timothy Bennett*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, Agent Identity Evals (AIE), to evaluate the identity stability and reliability of Language Model Agents (LMAs) over time, addressing their inherent challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the shortcomings of LMAs, such as loss of identity consistency, which affects their reliability, trustworthiness, and agentic capabilities like reasoning and planning.

Method: The authors propose the Agent Identity Evals (AIE) framework, comprising novel metrics and formal definitions for assessing and improving the identity stability of LMAs, with applications throughout their lifecycle.

Result: AIE provides a statistically-driven and empirically rigorous framework that integrates with existing performance metrics to evaluate and enhance LMAs' agentic identity and robustness.

Conclusion: By introducing AIE, the study provides tools to optimize LMA systems in terms of their identity consistency, improving their utility, trustworthiness, and functional reliability.

Abstract: Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents
(LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time.
However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs)
(statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and
linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability,
continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode
their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their
agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these
challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous,
statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an
LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including
their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations.
AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of
performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of
optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out
formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA
life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

### [8] [Students' Feedback Requests and Interactions with the SCRIPT Chatbot: Do They Get What They Ask For?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17258)
*Andreas Scholl,Natalie Kiesler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCRIPT, a ChatGPT-4o-mini-based chatbot aimed at supporting novice programming learners, evaluates its use with 136 students, and identifies patterns in feedback preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance programming education for novice learners by utilizing Generative AI for structured guidance and open-ended interactions.

Method: Developed and implemented SCRIPT, a chatbot on ChatGPT-4o-mini, and tested its effectiveness with 136 students in a programming course, analyzing their feedback preferences and task-solving interactions.

Result: Students exhibited patterns in feedback preferences, and 75% of chatbot responses were correctly aligned with their requested feedback types, ensuring adherence to system constraints.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate potential for GenAI tools like SCRIPT to provide meaningful support for programming learners, while highlighting challenges in balancing structured guidance with user flexibility.

Abstract: Building on prior research on Generative AI (GenAI) and related tools for
programming education, we developed SCRIPT, a chatbot based on ChatGPT-4o-mini,
to support novice learners. SCRIPT allows for open-ended interactions and
structured guidance through predefined prompts. We evaluated the tool via an
experiment with 136 students from an introductory programming course at a large
German university and analyzed how students interacted with SCRIPT while
solving programming tasks with a focus on their feedback preferences. The
results reveal that students' feedback requests seem to follow a specific
sequence. Moreover, the chatbot responses aligned well with students' requested
feedback types (in 75%), and it adhered to the system prompt constraints. These
insights inform the design of GenAI-based learning support systems and
highlight challenges in balancing guidance and flexibility in AI-assisted
tools.

### [9] [Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17289)
*Shitong Zhu,Chenhao Fang,Derek Larson,Neel Reddy Pochareddy,Rajeev Rao,Sophie Zeng,Yanqing Peng,Wendy Summer,Alex Goncalves,Arya Pudota,Herve Robert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), an AI assistant that streamlines enterprise compliance tasks using a dynamic routing mechanism for effective performance across simple and complex user queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the inefficiencies in handling compliance tasks in enterprise settings, seeking to enhance both response quality and processing efficiency.

Method: The authors developed a user query router with two modes: FastTrack for straightforward queries and FullAgentic for complex actions requiring multiple contextual integrations and tools.

Result: Experimental results showed CBA significantly outperformed standard LLMs, with higher keyword match rates (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and approval by LLM judges (82.0% vs. 20.0%). The routing-based design also performed better overall while maintaining run-time efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the routing mechanism effectively balances latency and quality, proving useful for enterprise compliance tasks by optimizing performance under varied query complexities.

Abstract: This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational,
agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks
for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between
response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can
intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that
only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and
(ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite
actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various
compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating
requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its
description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to
query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.
  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on
various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various
personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's
performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and
LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full
routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and
found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the
run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the
routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

### [10] [Ctx2TrajGen: Traffic Context-Aware Microscale Vehicle Trajectories using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17418)

TL;DR: Ctx2TrajGen is a framework for generating realistic vehicle trajectories in urban environments using advanced machine learning techniques, showing improved realism and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise trajectory modeling is critical for traffic analysis and autonomous driving, especially in urban settings where interactions and context matter.

Method: The proposed framework uses GAIL, PPO, and WGAN-GP to address training instability and nonlinear dependencies, explicitly conditioning trajectories on vehicle interactions and road geometry.

Result: Experiments on the DRIFT dataset show that Ctx2TrajGen outperforms existing methods in realism, behavioral diversity, and contextual alignment.

Conclusion: Ctx2TrajGen provides a robust solution to challenges like data scarcity and domain shift, optimizing urban driving trajectory modeling.

Abstract: Precise modeling of microscopic vehicle trajectories is critical for traffic
behavior analysis and autonomous driving systems. We propose Ctx2TrajGen, a
context-aware trajectory generation framework that synthesizes realistic urban
driving behaviors using GAIL. Leveraging PPO and WGAN-GP, our model addresses
nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic
settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry,
Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world
context. Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity,
and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain
shift without simulation.

### [11] [An Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17477)
*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents UDASA, an automated framework aimed at improving Large Language Model alignment without requiring human annotations. It leverages uncertainty quantifications to progressively optimize the model across different training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning Large Language Models with human intent and safety norms in a fully automated manner, avoiding reliance on human annotations.

Method: UDASA quantifies uncertainty in generated responses (semantics, factuality, value alignment), categorizes training samples into stages based on uncertainty differences, and progressively optimizes the model through these stages.

Result: Experimental validation indicates that UDASA surpasses existing alignment approaches in tasks such as harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation.

Conclusion: UDASA demonstrates strong potential for automating LLM alignment with improved outperforming models, paving the way for more autonomous and efficient alignment methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
instruction following and general-purpose reasoning. However, achieving
high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human
annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an
Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to
improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates
multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across
three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these
uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes
training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory,
according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized
progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of
preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong
empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that
UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including
harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation,
significantly improving model performance.

### [12] [LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17482)
*Luca Salvatore Lorello,Nikolaos Manginas,Marco Lippi,Stefano Melacci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework for evaluating neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods in temporal and constraint-driven contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating neuro-symbolic approaches in temporal reasoning and continual learning settings.

Method: LTLZinc generates datasets using linear temporal logic specifications over MiniZinc constraints and image classification datasets with fine-grained annotations enabling various training configurations.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the challenges of temporal learning, identified limitations in current methods, and showcased the utility of LTLZinc-generated tasks.

Conclusion: LTLZinc helps advance research on unified temporal learning and reasoning by providing datasets and tools for the neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures
with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable
formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge
over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned
concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial
intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting
where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom
explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can
be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against
which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the
temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive
temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic
specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification
datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic
training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six
neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks
generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning
and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods.
We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the
neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering
research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.

### [13] [CQE under Epistemic Dependencies: Algorithms and Experiments (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17487)
*Lorenzo Marconi,Flavia Ricci,Riccardo Rosati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) in the context of ontologies, focusing on combining epistemic dependencies (EDs) with optimal GA censors for strong security in query evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to regulate information disclosure in ontologies using epistemic dependencies, ensuring strong security guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency in query evaluation.

Method: The authors characterize security for intersection-based approaches using a specific class of EDs (full EDs), develop a first-order rewriting algorithm for a subclass of EDs in DL-Lite_R ontologies, and conduct experiments to validate their approach's feasibility.

Result: The findings show that the methodology ensures safety for full EDs, achieves AC^0 data complexity for Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs), and is practically feasible based on experimental verification.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates strong security guarantees, computational efficiency, and practical applicability for controlled query evaluation over ontologies with optimal GA censors.

Abstract: We investigate Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies, where
information disclosure is regulated by epistemic dependencies (EDs), a family
of logical rules recently proposed for the CQE framework. In particular, we
combine EDs with the notion of optimal GA censors, i.e. maximal sets of ground
atoms that are entailed by the ontology and can be safely revealed. We focus on
answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs) with respect to the
intersection of all optimal GA censors - an approach that has been shown in
other contexts to ensure strong security guarantees with favorable
computational behavior. First, we characterize the security of this
intersection-based approach and identify a class of EDs (namely, full EDs) for
which it remains safe. Then, for a subclass of EDs and for DL-Lite_R
ontologies, we show that answering BUCQs in the above CQE semantics is in AC^0
in data complexity by presenting a suitable, detailed first-order rewriting
algorithm. Finally, we report on experiments conducted in two different
evaluation scenarios, showing the practical feasibility of our rewriting
function.

*Alexander Beiser,Markus Hecher,Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the grounding bottleneck in Answer Set Programming by proposing an automated hybrid grounding technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the grounding bottleneck that restricts the industrial adoption of Answer Set Programming (ASP), particularly in scenarios with challenging grounding issues.

Method: The authors introduced a hybrid grounding approach using a splitting algorithm and heuristics based on rule structure and instance data estimation to decide between body-decoupled and standard grounding.

Result: Their experimental results indicate that the method improves performance in hard-to-ground scenarios and approaches state-of-the-art performance on hard-to-solve instances.

Conclusion: Automated hybrid grounding can effectively improve the efficiency of ASP grounding while addressing diverse scenarios with varying levels of complexity.

Abstract: The grounding bottleneck poses one of the key challenges that hinders the
widespread adoption of Answer Set Programming in industry. Hybrid Grounding is
a step in alleviating the bottleneck by combining the strength of standard
bottom-up grounding with recently proposed techniques where rule bodies are
decoupled during grounding. However, it has remained unclear when hybrid
grounding shall use body-decoupled grounding and when to use standard bottom-up
grounding. In this paper, we address this issue by developing automated hybrid
grounding: we introduce a splitting algorithm based on data-structural
heuristics that detects when to use body-decoupled grounding and when standard
grounding is beneficial. We base our heuristics on the structure of rules and
an estimation procedure that incorporates the data of the instance. The
experiments conducted on our prototypical implementation demonstrate promising
results, which show an improvement on hard-to-ground scenarios, whereas on
hard-to-solve instances we approach state-of-the-art performance.

*Yu Li,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Mengyuan Sun,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates multi-domain reasoning in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on interactions among mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding around the interplay among different reasoning skills in real-world multi-domain scenarios using RLVR for large language models (LLMs).

Method: The study uses the GRPO algorithm and Qwen-2.5-7B models to evaluate in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization, analyze interactions during cross-domain training, compare base and instruct models for RL, and systematically explore training strategies, reward designs, and language-specific factors.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal the dynamics of domain interactions, including mutual enhancements and conflicts, and identify factors influencing reasoning performance at both specialized and generalizable levels.

Conclusion: The insights and findings serve as valuable guidance to optimize RL methods, advancing multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing
research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as
mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real
world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of
multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning
skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this
gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the
RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a
comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO
algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the
models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities
when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the
intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge
during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence
of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base
and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we
delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts
of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and
language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer
significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing
key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning
performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL
methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a tool that simplifies legal TAI assessment and facilitates compliance with the AI Act, focusing on the risk levels of AI systems.

Method: The tool uses a two-step approach: a pre-screening phase followed by an assessment phase, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation to evaluate AI system risks and retrieve relevant legal texts.

Result: Qualitative evaluation demonstrates the tool's effectiveness in accurately predicting risk levels and retrieving relevant legal information across three semantic groups.

Conclusion: The TAI Scan Tool shows promise in guiding AI developers and organizations through compliance with the AI Act by identifying risk levels and providing actionable insights through relevant legal articles.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool
with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI
assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI
Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment
phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the
risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time
retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their
obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields
promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant
articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of
results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting
of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring
careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.

*Xinyao Liu,Diping Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific multimodal large language model (MLLM), and a specialized dataset called FundusGen, to improve precision in ophthalmic diagnostics by integrating localization and diagnostic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in ophthalmology-related MLLMs, including fragmented annotation granularity and inconsistent clinical reasoning logic, for improved cross-modal understanding.

Method: Introduced FundusExpert, a fine-tuned MLLM leveraging FundusGen data constructed via the Fundus-Engine system. This system integrates global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained analysis while incorporating clinically-aligned reasoning chains.

Result: FundusExpert outperformed existing models in ophthalmic Q&A tasks by 26.6% and excelled in zero-shot report generation with 77.0% clinical consistency, compared to GPT-4's 47.6%.

Conclusion: The integration of localization and reasoning chains enhances diagnostic reasoning and data efficiency, paving the way for clinically-aligned and scalable MLLMs in specialized domains.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in
the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the
intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and
leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable
reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,
achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with
diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned
MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific
MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.

*Yongchao Zeng,Calum Brown,Ioannis Kyriakou,Ronja Hotz,Mark Rounsevell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the HoPeS framework incorporating large language model (LLM)-powered agents for simulating and exploring diverse stakeholder perspectives to understand socio-ecological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accessing diverse stakeholder perspectives and support analysis and integration across different viewpoints in socio-ecological systems.

Method: The HoPeS framework uses LLM-powered agents to represent stakeholders, enabling users to adopt agent roles and navigate different perspectives through a simulation scaffold. A prototype system demonstrates its application in experiments involving institutional dynamics and land use changes.

Result: The illustrative experiment shows discrepancies between research-based policy recommendations and stakeholder implementations due to competing advocacies. It highlights emotional challenges from the researcher’s perspective and the potential for exploring alternative narrative strategies.

Conclusion: Refining this framework and protocol may foster interdisciplinary collaboration and provide new ways to navigate socio-ecological simulations through perspective integration.

Abstract: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse
stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable
alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder
perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)
modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models
(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles
to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a
"scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting
users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across
perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the
context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both
narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a
user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher
- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform
evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various
institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound
policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and
implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world
misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's
reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment
as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political
neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user
exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing
strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different
perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new
forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

*Ilias Chatzistefanidis,Navid Nikaein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI paradigm using Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with real-time optimization for 6G networks, achieving more efficient and trustworthy decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evolve 6G networks from isolated AI task management to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-driven networks for broader decision-making and adaptability.

Method: The approach integrates LLMs with optimizers: input-level optimizers to ensure numerical accuracy and output-level optimizers for adaptive real-time control. It also proposes two novel agent types specialized for Radio Access Network optimization and Service-Level Agreement negotiations.

Result: Symbiotic agents significantly reduce decision errors by fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, with smaller language models achieving high accuracy while reducing GPU overhead by 99.9%. They also decrease RAN over-utilization by about 44%.

Conclusion: The proposed symbiotic paradigm outlines a foundational system for AGI-driven networks that are adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy, emphasizing the potential for significant advancements in 6G network infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a
vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time
decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users.
This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach,
where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to
artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess
broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with
real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic
agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty
steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers
supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and
implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,
and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We
further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on
a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show
that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone
LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy
with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of
82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world
testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and
resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.
Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the
symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven
networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even
as LLMs advance.

*Zhao Song,Song Yue,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) enhanced with tools can outperform basic large language models (LLMs). Results show LRMs augmented with tools are consistently better across all task complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the debate on whether LRMs provide actual benefits in reasoning tasks and examine if tool augmentations improve their performance.

Method: The authors compare LRMs and basic LLMs using Apple's reasoning benchmarks after introducing tool augmentations such as Python interpreters and scratchpads.

Result: LRMs equipped with tools consistently performed better than standard LLMs across tasks of varying complexities.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented LRMs offer significant advantages for reasoning tasks, countering recent doubts about their effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large
language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a
step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle
complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g.,
[Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not
actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning
actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we
revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist
when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools,
Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and
their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show
that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the
recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of
tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online competition system to alleviate operational burdens by automating submission evaluation and ensuring compatibility for research competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address difficulties in tracking progress in research areas due to dispersed publications and the operational burden of managing competitions.

Method: Develop an online platform to automate and streamline the submission and evaluation process, utilizing isolated environments for compatibility.

Result: The system successfully managed submissions for competitions such as the Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners.

Conclusion: The proposed system simplifies competition management, enhances efficiency, and resolves compatibility issues in research competitions.

Abstract: Research communities have developed benchmark datasets across domains to
compare the performance of algorithms and techniques However, tracking the
progress in these research areas is not easy, as publications appear in
different venues at the same time, and many of them claim to represent the
state-of-the-art. To address this, research communities often organise periodic
competitions to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and techniques,
thereby tracking advancements in the field. However, these competitions pose a
significant operational burden. The organisers must manage and evaluate a large
volume of submissions. Furthermore, participants typically develop their
solutions in diverse environments, leading to compatibility issues during the
evaluation of their submissions. This paper presents an online competition
system that automates the submission and evaluation process for a competition.
The competition system allows organisers to manage large numbers of submissions
efficiently, utilising isolated environments to evaluate submissions. This
system has already been used successfully for several competitions, including
the Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners
competition.

### [22] [A Hybrid Early-Exit Algorithm for Large Language Models Based on Space Alignment Decoding (SPADE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17618)
*Bowen Zheng,Ming Ma,Zhongqiao Lin,Tianming Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the high computational cost of large language models by proposing SPADE, a method that improves early-exit decoding and maintains accuracy while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are resource-intensive, and early-exit methods fail to adequately reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy due to misaligned intermediate representations.

Method: The authors introduce SPADE, which aligns intermediate layer outputs with the output layer using a minimally reduced token sequence. They also train a linear approximation to refine early-exit decisions based on entropy-based confidence metrics.

Result: The hybrid early-exit algorithm developed in this study reduces inference costs significantly while retaining high-quality accuracy in model outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed SPADE approach offers an efficient and scalable method for deploying large language models, achieving cost reduction without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep
structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain
sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development
of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation
at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance
due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that
lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE
(SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate
layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced
sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further
optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear
approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting
them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence
levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate
high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs
without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for
deploying large language models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework, IGCS, for content selection tasks in NLP, proposes IGCS-Bench as a benchmark, a synthetic dataset for transfer learning, and addresses LLM inference issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing content selection tasks have been studied in isolation, requiring a unified approach and resources.

Method: Introduces IGCS for instruction-guided task framing, IGCS-bench for benchmarking, and a synthetic dataset for transfer learning. LLM inference and evaluation issues are also discussed.

Result: Transfer learning with the synthetic dataset improves task performance and the proposed framework demonstrates utility in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The IGCS framework and its resources offer new avenues for improving and unifying content selection tasks in NLP.

Abstract: A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given
source texts. Despite this shared objective, such \textit{content selection}
tasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling
approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose
\textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified
framework for such settings, where the task definition and any
instance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model.
To promote this framework, we introduce \igcsbench{}, the first unified
benchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large
generic synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection
tasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts
performance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or
not. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based
modeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall
propose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection
models. Models and datasets available at https://github.com/shmuelamar/igcs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates AI Consult, a clinical decision support tool, showing its potential to reduce diagnostic and treatment errors in primary care settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language model-based tools can enhance clinical decision-making and reduce errors in live healthcare settings.

Method: The researchers conducted a quality improvement study in 15 clinics, tracking and comparing 39,849 patient visits performed with and without the AI Consult system. Independent physicians reviewed visits to assess errors.

Result: Clinicians using AI Consult experienced 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. Scaled to Penda Health's operations, this could prevent errors in up to 51,000 patient visits annually.

Conclusion: The integration of aligned, workflow-focused AI tools like AI Consult can significantly reduce clinical errors, improve care quality, and provide a framework for responsible AI adoption in healthcare settings.

Abstract: We evaluate the impact of large language model-based clinical decision
support in live care. In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary
care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a
safety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical
decision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows,
activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a
quality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits
performed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics.
Visits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors.
Clinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer
diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the
introduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and
treatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of
clinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the
quality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was "substantial".
These results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation
and active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study
demonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to
reduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for
advancing responsible adoption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of handling unanswerable questions in Conversational Information Retrieval systems by proposing a novel approach called SALU, an integrated method within large language models to improve unanswerability detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reliability in Conversational Information Retrieval systems and reduce responses with hallucinated or misleading content by addressing unanswerable questions effectively.

Method: Proposes SALU, which is trained using a multi-task learning framework to handle both standard QA and explicit abstention. It employs reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to reward appropriate non-responses and penalize hallucinations.

Result: SALU consistently outperformed hybrid LLM-classifier systems in accuracy, showcased reduced hallucination instances, and demonstrated superior performance in human evaluations for reliability and factuality.

Conclusion: SALU enhances the robustness and reliability of LLMs by fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries, proving effectiveness in distinguishing unanswerable queries and appropriately abstaining from providing misleading answers.

Abstract: Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive
access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling
unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated
content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can
introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a
novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within
the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning
framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention
generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a
confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards
appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge
boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built
C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines,
including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly
answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms
SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate
abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination,
demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."

TL;DR: This paper introduces the mKGQAgent for converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries using modular subtasks, and demonstrated superior performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accessing structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs via multilingual natural-language interfaces inspired the development of more efficient methods.

Method: The paper presents mKGQAgent, a modular, interpretable framework using LLM workflows for planning, entity linking, and query refinement, guided by an experience pool for in-context learning.

Result: The mKGQAgent achieved first place in Text2SPARQL 2025 benchmarks on DBpedia and Corporate KGQA datasets.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential for creating human-like reasoning systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of
the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones.
Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific
query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform
natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior
approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or
neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the
end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the
task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular,
interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for
planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool
for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.
Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the
Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other
participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning
systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores improving Question Answering systems in agriculture by fine-tuning large language models with synthetic, multilingual agricultural datasets in English, Hindi, and Punjabi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of general-purpose LLMs in providing region-specific and multilingual agricultural advisories, which lack precision due to inadequate domain-specific training and data.

Method: The authors generate multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets and fine-tune language-specific LLMs to improve their performance in delivering localized farming advice.

Result: Fine-tuned models demonstrated evident improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and adherence to agricultural consensus as compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The study establishes that synthetic data generation and language-specific fine-tuning significantly enhance LLM performance for delivering accurate, localized agricultural advisory services, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings.

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their
native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the
agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to
implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available
general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking
precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient
domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific
datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual
synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from
agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our
evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the
fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results
highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning
as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture,
especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate
and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful
step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for
diverse linguistic communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines name-based benchmarking in LLMs to uncover biases in cultural contexts and accuracy disparities, finding smaller models exhibit greater bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate latent biases in LLMs based on culturally indicative names rather than explicit demographic markers, reflecting real-world applications.

Method: A benchmarking approach using culturally indicative names from the BBQ dataset to assess bias and accuracy across various LLMs, comparing large and small models.

Result: Smaller models showed higher bias and lower accuracy, with larger models performing better in name substitution scenarios, e.g., Claude Sonnet outperformed Claude Haiku.

Conclusion: Biases in LLMs persist across contextual refinements and model sizes, emphasizing the need for more equitable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit latent biases towards specific
nationalities even when explicit demographic markers are not present. In this
work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the
Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting
explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more
reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this
substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs
from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments
show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to
their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the
ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku
exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for
its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by
117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger
portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after
substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of
the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other
model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn
resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the
development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses advanced generative AI models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5) for multi-label classification of suicidality-related factors from psychiatric EHRs, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the global suicide crisis by improving early identification of multiple, co-occurring suicidality-related factors, using AI tools for better clinical intervention.

Method: The paper uses a novel end-to-end generative multi-label classification pipeline, applies GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5 models, and employs advanced evaluation methods like a multilabel confusion matrix.

Result: GPT-3.5 achieved 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score. GPT-4.5 performed better across label sets, including rare cases, showcasing systematic error patterns and robust outcomes.

Conclusion: Generative AI models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5 can effectively classify complex clinical suicidality-related factors. The study also suggests how to structure EHR data for large-scale clinical research.

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths
annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide
attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),
including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied
AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary
classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.
This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs
from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to
end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,
including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error
analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match
accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior
performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,
indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal
systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight
the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only
demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical
classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured
EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.

### [30] [Can External Validation Tools Improve Annotation Quality for LLM-as-a-Judge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17015)
*Arduin Findeis,Floris Weers,Guoli Yin,Ke Ye,Ruoming Pang,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a tool-enhanced system for pairwise preference evaluation of model responses, leveraging external validation methods like web-search and code execution to improve annotation quality across challenging domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise preference evaluation often struggles with subjective judgment bias in domains like factual, math, and coding responses, where current metrics or human annotations may lack reliability.

Method: The authors propose augmenting AI annotator systems with external validation mechanisms, including web-search and code execution, to independently verify model response accuracy and quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved annotation quality in long-form factual, math, and code tasks using the proposed system, while highlighting sensitivity to parameters like prompts and the need for better benchmarks.

Conclusion: External tools can enhance annotation quality in complex response domains, though further refinement and reliable benchmarks are required to ensure consistent gains across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate
and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative
model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better"
response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded
metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping
model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise
comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for
responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh
writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore
augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve
performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and
code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality
feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to
ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal
knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our
method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation
tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as
three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our
results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many,
but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity
of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved
(non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at

### [31] [Evolutionary Feature-wise Thresholding for Binary Representation of NLP Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17025)
*Soumen Sinha,Shahryar Rahnamayan,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel optimization framework for text embedding, using feature-specific binary thresholds to enhance performance in NLP applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Storage and computational efficiency in NLP applications require a shift from real-valued to binary embeddings.

Method: The proposed method uses a Coordinate Search optimization framework to identify optimal, feature-specific thresholds for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations.

Result: Binary embeddings generated using the optimal thresholds outperform traditional fixed-threshold methods in accuracy across diverse NLP tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Feature-specific binary encoding improves efficiency and accuracy, broadening applicability across machine learning domains beyond NLP.

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language
processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are
key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations
(barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings
derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common
method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often
using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate
Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal
threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead
to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary
representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across
various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising
results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform
text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests
on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to
other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal
thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in
accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and
can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it
useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

*Cheng Liu,Yifei Lu,Fanghua Ye,Jian Li,Xingyu Chen,Feiliang Ren,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogDual is a novel role-playing language agent model using a cognize-then-respond paradigm, improving consistency and alignment through cognitive modeling and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on cognitive mechanisms in existing role-playing agents, aiming to enhance behavioral consistency and contextual relevance.

Method: CogDual integrates external situational awareness and internal self-awareness using a cognize-then-respond reasoning paradigm, optimized via reinforcement learning with general-purpose rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks like CoSER, Cross-MR, and LifeChoice show that CogDual outperforms traditional models and generalizes well across tasks.

Conclusion: CogDual demonstrates improved performance and adaptability for role-playing tasks by incorporating cognitive paradigms and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a significant
application direction for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches
typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models
to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the
underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by
cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a
\textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external
situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses
with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further
optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two
general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation.
Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and
LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing
baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

### [33] [SKA-Bench: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Structured Knowledge Understanding of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17178)
*Zhiqiang Liu,Enpei Niu,Yin Hua,Mengshu Sun,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SKA-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate and diagnose large language models' (LLMs) structured knowledge (SK) understanding across knowledge graph (KG), tables, and mixed forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for LLMs' understanding of structured knowledge lack rigor and focus primarily on a single SK type, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: SKA-Bench is built using a three-stage pipeline and includes testbeds for Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection to test LLMs' SK comprehension.

Result: Empirical evaluation of 8 LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, reveals challenges like dealing with noise, knowledge unit order, and hallucination issues.

Conclusion: Current LLMs require further improvement to handle structured knowledge effectively, highlighting gaps in their SK comprehension.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations
for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific
capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a
more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to
diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a
Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used
structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a
three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a
question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To
evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we
expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,
Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical
evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,
indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding
structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as
the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination
phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation tools for assessing the performance and collaboration capabilities of AI agents in complex financial tasks.

Method: The authors developed FinGAIA, a benchmark with 407 financial tasks across three hierarchical scenario levels, and tested 10 AI agents in a zero-shot setting to assess their capabilities.

Result: ChatGPT emerged as the best-performing AI agent with an accuracy of 48.9%, still trailing financial experts by over 35 percentage points. The study uncovered five recurring failure patterns in the agents.

Conclusion: FinGAIA highlights significant limitations and opportunities for improving AI agents in the financial domain and provides a foundation for further research and development.

Abstract: The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for
automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step,
multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain
underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed
to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain.
FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major
financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts,
and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels
of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and
strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot
setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of
48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial
experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five
recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial
Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These
patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the
first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to
objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

*Giuseppe Russo,Debora Nozza,Paul Röttger,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Moral Dilemma Dataset to evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) align with human moral judgments and proposes a method, Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), to improve this alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments, given their increasing use for moral advice.

Method: The authors created the Moral Dilemma Dataset, containing moral dilemmas paired with human moral judgments, and treated it as a distributional alignment task. They also developed a method called Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP) to condition model outputs on human value profiles.

Result: The study found that LLMs align with human judgments only in high-consensus situations, with alignment deteriorating under disagreement. LLMs also relied on fewer moral values than humans. DMP improved alignment by 64.3% and increased the diversity of moral values expressed.

Conclusion: The research highlights a pluralistic moral gap between LLMs and humans. The authors provide a method, DMP, to reduce this gap, thereby advancing more human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice,
which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely
LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral
Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a
distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a
free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional
alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across
dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high
consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In
parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions
extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral
values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch
in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,
we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method
that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves
alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more
pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

### [36] [CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234)
*Kyeongkyu Lee,Seonghwan Yoon,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLARIFID, a novel framework for clinically reliable automatic radiology report generation, addressing issues with factual correctness and single-view limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists face a significant workload, and automated report generation could alleviate this burden. However, current methods lack clinical reliability and comprehensiveness, motivating the development of better solutions.

Method: CLARIFID optimizes diagnostic correctness by mimicking expert workflows: section-aware pretraining, fine-tuning with a reward system based on clinical scores, reasoning-aware decoding, and multi-view image fusion.

Result: CLARIFID demonstrates superior clinical efficacy and outperforms baseline methods on standard metrics and clinically-aware scores using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework ensures clinically accurate radiology reports by emphasizing reasoning, multi-view analysis, and structured report generation, offering significant improvements over current approaches.

Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate
radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver
clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on
producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of
the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic
comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly
optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts.
Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression
through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy
Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as
the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings"
before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views
via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a
reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level
re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings
section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent
clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing
baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.

TL;DR: This paper explores the applicability of the GeAR graph-based approach for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study stems from the limited evidence of general applicability of graph-based RAG methods to broader datasets beyond task-specific scopes.

Method: The authors adapt a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG solution, GeAR, and test its performance and limitations.

Result: The paper evaluates how effectively GeAR performs on a broader challenge, specifically SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG.

Conclusion: The work extends insights into the adaptability and robustness of GeAR for general-purpose retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored graph-based approaches to retrieval-augmented
generation, leveraging structured or semi-structured information -- such as
entities and their relations extracted from documents -- to enhance retrieval.
However, these methods are typically designed to address specific tasks, such
as multi-hop question answering and query-focused summarisation, and therefore,
there is limited evidence of their general applicability across broader
datasets. In this paper, we aim to adapt a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG
solution: $\text{GeAR}$ and explore its performance and limitations on the

*Carlotta Quensel,Neele Falk,Gabriella Lapesa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of subjective elements like emotions, storytelling, and hedging on argument strength using regression analysis on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of large-scale studies examining how subjective features relate to argument strength in natural language processing (NLP).

Method: Regression analysis is conducted on two standard datasets to evaluate the influence of subjective factors (emotions, storytelling, hedging) on both objective argument quality and subjective persuasion.

Result: The study identifies contrasting effects of subjective features. Storytelling and hedging show opposite impacts on objective vs. subjective argument quality, while emotions' impact varies based on rhetorical use.

Conclusion: Subjective features play distinct roles in argument strength, and their effects depend on how they are applied to rhetorical contexts.

Abstract: In assessing argument strength, the notions of what makes a good argument are
manifold. With the broader trend towards treating subjectivity as an asset and
not a problem in NLP, new dimensions of argument quality are studied. Although
studies on individual subjective features like personal stories exist, there is
a lack of large-scale analyses of the relation between these features and
argument strength. To address this gap, we conduct regression analysis to
quantify the impact of subjective factors $-$ emotions, storytelling, and
hedging $-$ on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality
and subjective persuasion. As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level
of contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied
dimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for
each subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression
analysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the
two facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that
storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective
argument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric
utilization rather than the domain.

*Shiting Chen,Zijian Zhao,Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by combining benefits of multiple embedding models. Confident RAG outperforms vanilla RAG, showcasing efficient improvements across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve domain-specific models by incorporating external knowledge and handling limitations in embedding models used in RAG.

Method: The study proposes Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG approaches to combine embedding model benefits for better retrieval and response quality.

Result: Confident RAG significantly improves response quality, yielding about 10% improvement over vanilla LLMs and 5% over vanilla RAG.

Conclusion: Confident RAG offers an efficient, plug-and-play solution for domain-specific retrieval augmentation and will be made publicly available upon paper publication.

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various
fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or
adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered
wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an
inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort
for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model
architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different
benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity
calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To
address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by
combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding
RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects
retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;
however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG
generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then
selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average
improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,
respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models
indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various
domains. We will release our code upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The MultiNRC benchmark evaluates LLMs' multilingual reasoning, emphasizing native and culturally grounded questions across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities in diverse languages and cultural contexts, as existing benchmarks are largely translated from English.

Method: Created a benchmark of over 1,000 native reasoning questions in French, Spanish, and Chinese across reasoning categories such as culture, language, and math.

Result: No LLM scored above 50% on MultiNRC, with distinct strengths and weaknesses observed across tasks; math reasoning in English outperformed other languages by 10%.

Conclusion: LLMs still struggle with native multilingual reasoning, particularly with culturally grounded knowledge, highlighting the need for further improvement.

Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on
reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual
reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains
limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed
by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks
towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this
work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a
benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and
culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,
Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:
language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition
reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition
reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English
equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation
from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can
provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.
English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14
leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent
set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native
multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs
exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and
logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math
reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating
persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper presents Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, a high-fidelity, low-latency simultaneous interpretation system with significant improvements over commercial alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simultaneous interpretation systems face challenges like poor transcription and translation, high latency, speaker confusion, and speech inflation, especially in long-form dialogues.

Method: Introduces a duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework employing large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning for improved accuracy and latency.

Result: The model achieves over 70% correctness in complex scenarios, reduces latency to 3 seconds, and outperforms commercial solutions in translation quality and usability.

Conclusion: Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 represents a significant advancement in simultaneous interpretation, delivering superior accuracy and usability with ultra-low latency for practical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting
frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems
long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation
quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and
translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study,
we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers
high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning
capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret
2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech
understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that
through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves
a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency,
validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios.
Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by
significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency
of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is
around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of synthetic voice corpora generated through LLM-driven text creation and TTS systems to improve African ASR systems. It shows promising improvements in low-resource languages using synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of ASR technology for the over 2300 African languages, most of which have limited or no voice corpora, through the use of synthetic data generation.

Method: The study uses a three-step process: text creation with a language model (LLM), synthesizing speech through TTS, and fine-tuning ASR systems. It evaluates readability scores and performance on different real-to-synthetic data ratios across various languages.

Result: The results show that synthetic data can achieve competitive performance compared to real data in ASR systems. For example, combining synthetic and real data achieved significant WER improvements for languages like Hausa, Dholuo, and Chichewa.

Conclusion: Synthetic voice data, when combined with real data, is a cost-effective and efficient approach to improving ASR performance for African languages. However, additional efforts are needed in refining datasets, evaluation protocols, and intercoder reliability for further advances.

Abstract: Speech technology remains out of reach for most of the over 2300 languages in
Africa. We present the first systematic assessment of large-scale synthetic
voice corpora for African ASR. We apply a three-step process: LLM-driven text
creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Eight out of ten languages
for which we create synthetic text achieved readability scores above 5 out of
7. We evaluated ASR improvement for three (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa) and created
more than 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% of the cost of real
data. Fine-tuned Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models trained on 250h real and 250h
synthetic Hausa matched a 500h real-data-only baseline, while 579h real and
450h to 993h synthetic data created the best performance. We also present
gender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource
languages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2
real-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on
some evaluation data, but not on others. Investigating intercoder reliability,
ASR errors and evaluation datasets revealed the need for more robust reviewer
protocols and more accurate evaluation data. All data and models are publicly
released to invite further work to improve synthetic data for African
languages.

*Mohammed Bouri,Adnane Saoud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Growth Bound Matrices (GBM), a novel regularization technique, to enhance NLP model robustness against adversarial attacks, achieving up to 8.8% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underexplored area of robustness in recurrent and state space models (SSMs) like S4 against adversarial attacks such as synonym substitutions.

Method: Proposes computing Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) for LSTM, S4, and CNN architectures to reduce the impact of input perturbations on model outputs, enhancing their resilience and generalization.

Result: The proposed GBM method outperforms existing baselines, achieving up to 8.8% improvement in adversarial robustness across multiple architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the GBM technique in enhancing adversarial robustness and generalization, notably providing a systematic robustness analysis for SSMs. Relevant code is made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM) framework that replaces learning rate decay with model merging for improved training performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon traditional learning rate decay techniques by offering a more generalized and effective framework through model merging.

Method: Introduction of the WSM framework, which formalizes a connection between learning rate decay strategies and model merging, and identifies the optimal merge duration for checkpoint aggregation.

Result: WSM outperforms the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach on various benchmarks, achieving up to +5.5% improvement in performance across tasks such as MATH, HumanEval, and MMLU-Pro.

Conclusion: WSM provides a superior alternative to decay-based approaches by leveraging model merging, offering significant advantages for both standard and fine-tuning training scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the
effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay
phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have
emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present
Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal
connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a
unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including
cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model
averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization
methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training
window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model
performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge
quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted
Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving
significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on
MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning
scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

### [46] [Who Attacks, and Why? Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636)
*Victor Hartman,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study utilizes zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning and conducts a study of 18 million tweets in Europe, revealing insights into party-level communication strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations in existing methods for studying negative campaigning, which are costly, unscalable, and language-specific.

Method: The authors employed zero-shot LLMs to classify negative campaigning across 10 benchmark languages and applied the approach to analyze tweets from parliamentarians across 19 European countries.

Result: LLMs performed as well as native-speaking human coders and outperformed traditional supervised machine learning methods; findings indicated governing parties use less negativity, while ideologically extreme and populist parties, especially far-right ones, use more.

Conclusion: LLMs offer scalable, transparent, and replicable tools for analyzing political communication across diverse linguistic and cultural terrains, enhancing our comprehension of strategic communication in multiparty contexts.

Abstract: Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet
empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of
existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First,
it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for
cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets
in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with
native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine
learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the
largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18
million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017
and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing
parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme
and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in
significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our
understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication
in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of
LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political
communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.

### [47] [Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17702)
*Changxin Tian,Kunlong Chen,Jia Liu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, explaining its computational efficiency and predicting its model capacity using a new metric, Efficiency Leverage (EL). Insights are validated empirically and provide scaling laws for MoE efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of predicting the model capacity of MoE configurations efficiently, improving scalability and understanding of large-scale language models.

Method: The paper introduces Efficiency Leverage (EL) as a metric, conducts a large-scale empirical study with over 300 models up to 28B parameters, and integrates findings into scaling laws.

Result: Empirical findings reveal that EL is determined by expert activation ratio and compute budget, with predictable power laws, while expert granularity shows nonlinear effects. Validation experiments confirm EL scaling accuracy, showing 7x computation savings in a comparison model.

Conclusion: The study creates a solid, empirically validated framework for efficiently scaling MoE architectures using derived scaling laws, demonstrating substantial computational efficiency without performance compromise.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large
Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from
computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:
predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert
activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address
this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the
computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a
large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to
systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural
configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the
expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following
predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator
with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified
scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its
configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained
Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active
parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an
identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance
of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,
thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a
principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TyDi QA-WANA, a multilingual question-answering dataset for evaluating models' utilization of large text contexts, specifically in Western Asian and Northern African languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a question-answering dataset that captures information-seeking behavior and evaluates models' ability to handle questions in culturally relevant and diverse language contexts.

Method: A dataset with 28K examples was collected directly in 10 Western Asian and Northern African languages. Each question is paired with a full article that may or may not contain the answer. No translation approaches were used to maintain cultural accuracy.

Result: Two baseline models were evaluated on the dataset, and the performance was presented to benchmark future improvements.

Conclusion: The TyDi QA-WANA dataset is made openly available with accompanying code to foster community engagement and further advancements in multilingual question answering.

Abstract: We present TyDi QA-WANA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 28K
examples divided among 10 language varieties of western Asia and northern
Africa. The data collection process was designed to elicit information-seeking
questions, where the asker is genuinely curious to know the answer. Each
question in paired with an entire article that may or may not contain the
answer; the relatively large size of the articles results in a task suitable
for evaluating models' abilities to utilize large text contexts in answering
questions. Furthermore, the data was collected directly in each language
variety, without the use of translation, in order to avoid issues of cultural
relevance. We present performance of two baseline models, and release our code
and data to facilitate further improvement by the research community.

*Karen Zhou,John Giorgi,Pranav Mani,Peng Xu,Davis Liang,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline to create a human-centered, interpretable evaluation checklist for AI-generated clinical notes, improving alignment with physician preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating AI-generated clinical notes is challenging due to subjective and non-scalable expert reviews, and current metrics don't align with physician preferences.

Method: A pipeline distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation, enforced by LLM-based evaluators, validated on data from over 21,000 clinical encounters.

Result: The feedback-derived checklist outperforms baseline approaches in coverage, diversity, and alignment with human ratings, even under perturbations.

Conclusion: The checklist demonstrates practical utility, robustness, and improved alignment with clinician preferences for evaluating AI-generated clinical notes.

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but
evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and
limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to
align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a
pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured
checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be
interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based
evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,
prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI
medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms
baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and
predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the
checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant
alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation
methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify
notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-driven phone surveys leveraging voice AI for scaling quantitative research while preserving human-like interaction. It tested an AI system adhering to research protocols and validated its performance across survey completion, break-offs, and satisfaction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable yet interactive and rigorous quantitative survey methodologies using AI telephone surveying over traditional methods.

Method: Developed an AI system using LLMs, ASR, and speech synthesis, strictly adhering to research best practices, and tested it in two pilot surveys alongside human-administered follow-up surveys.

Result: The study found that shorter survey instruments and responsive AI systems positively impacted survey completion rates, reduced break-offs, and improved respondent satisfaction.

Conclusion: AI telephone surveying shows promise in achieving human-like interactivity and methodological rigor, enhancing respondent experience, and improving survey metrics.

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI
telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can
scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like
interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used
interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI
enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust
to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on
large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech
synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative
research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order
randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot
surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate
human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three
key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent
satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more
responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three
metrics studied.

TL;DR: Megrez2 is a lightweight, efficient language model optimized for deployment on devices, utilizing novel mechanisms for parameter reduction and performance enhancement while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create a high-performance language model that balances accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Megrez2 employs a cross-layer expert sharing mechanism to reduce parameters and pre-gated routing to improve memory-efficiency and inference speed. The model undergoes extensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Megrez2-Preview, with only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to larger models across broad tasks such as code generation and language understanding.

Conclusion: Megrez2 successfully combines efficiency, deployability, and accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications with limited resources.

Abstract: We present Megrez2, a novel lightweight and high-performance language model
architecture optimized for device native deployment. Megrez2 introduces a novel
cross-layer expert sharing mechanism, which significantly reduces total
parameter count by reusing expert modules across adjacent transformer layers
while maintaining most of the model's capacity. It also incorporates pre-gated
routing, enabling memory-efficient expert loading and faster inference. As the
first instantiation of the Megrez2 architecture, we introduce the
Megrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and
further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. With only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters,
Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to
larger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding,
instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. These
results highlight the effectiveness of the Megrez2 architecture to achieve a
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it a strong
candidate for real-world, resource-constrained applications.

*Linbo Cao,Jinman Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a debate-driven evaluation framework for advanced language models, converting QA datasets into structured debates adjudicated by a blind judge model, to address memorization and data contamination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QA benchmarks are increasingly saturated by advanced language models, leading to concerns about memorization, data contamination, and high dataset creation costs.

Method: A novel debate-driven evaluation framework is introduced, converting QA datasets into multi-round adversarial debates adjudicated by a separate judge model blind to correct answers. This increases difficulty and penalizes memorization while reusing existing QA items.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the paradigm’s robustness; models pre-trained on test questions perform worse in debates. Even weaker judge models can reliably assess stronger debaters. The framework reduces dataset creation costs while enhancing evaluation scalability.

Conclusion: The debate-driven evaluation framework effectively addresses traditional QA benchmark limitations, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to genuinely assess reasoning abilities in advanced language models.

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks,
concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset
creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that
transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where
one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and
defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the
correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach
substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet
reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:
(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based
assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's
effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized
protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of
the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model
fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)
but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can
reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based
evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a
fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework
underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need,"
offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of
advanced language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision transformer-based deep learning model to improve disaster-affected area segmentation using remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance disaster mapping processes and support the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) for more reliable segmentation using remote sensing data.

Method: The method involves using vision transformers trained on weakly supervised data generated via PCA-based feature space analysis and confidence index expansion, with multi-band inputs and an advanced encoder-decoder architecture.

Result: Case studies on disasters such as the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and 2023 Rhodes wildfire validate improved segmentation smoothness and reliability from the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and reliable segmentation approach for disaster mapping, especially when ground truth data is unavailable.

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

TL;DR: This paper addresses real-time monocular 3D human pose estimation by integrating lightweight 2D-to-3D lifting methods with geometry-aware priors, creating plausible training pairs to enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of real-time monocular 3D pose estimation in diverse environments without relying heavily on large annotated datasets or expensive equipment.

Method: The framework combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, using camera intrinsics, anatomical priors, and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics for training data generation.

Result: The proposed method generates plausible 2D-3D training data from MoCap and synthetic datasets, enabling fast and personalized 3D pose estimation.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a promising approach for bridging data-driven learning with model-based priors, improving real-time, deployable 3D pose estimation systems in unconstrained scenarios.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackCue improves crack detection by leveraging thin structure properties and generating robust crack cues unaffected by backgrounds, lighting, or shadows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods struggle with detecting cracks in unseen domains due to overlooked thin structure properties.

Method: CrackCue uses coarse-to-fine crack cue generation via max-pooling, upsampling, and reconstruction networks to isolate crack cues for detection.

Result: Incorporating CrackCue into three advanced networks significantly enhanced robustness and generalization in crack detection.

Conclusion: CrackCue is a plug-and-play method boosting performance in crack detection; source code will be shared publicly.

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

*Xiaoqiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLAMP, a novel framework for fine-grained multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA), addressing issues of cross-modal alignment noise and representation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in MABSA, such as cross-modal alignment noise, insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations, and inadequate connection between aspect terms and the corresponding visual regions.

Method: The proposed method, CLAMP, includes three main components: Progressive Attention Fusion network for better cross-modal alignment, Multi-task Contrastive Learning for enhanced representation consistency, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation to balance task-specific uncertainties.

Result: CLAMP successfully outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying aspect terms and determining their sentiments in paired image-text data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that CLAMP is an effective end-to-end framework for addressing limitations in MABSA, significantly improving cross-modal alignment and representation consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIA, a training-free prompt engineering framework designed to proactively detect and mitigate harmful intent in multimodal (image-text) inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) in real-world applications, new safety risks arise from harmful intent emerging from seemingly innocuous multimodal inputs.

Method: The SIA framework involves three stages: visual abstraction (image captioning), intent inference (few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning), and intent-conditioned response refinement.

Result: SIA demonstrates substantial safety improvements on benchmarks such as SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, while showing minor reductions in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar.

Conclusion: SIA effectively enhances safety in VLMs by dynamically adapting to inferred intent, showcasing the significance of intent-aware reasoning in aligning models with human-centric values.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to address feature misalignment in LiDAR-camera fusion for 3D perception in autonomous vehicles, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the problem of misalignment between LiDAR and camera features due to projection errors, which impacts depth supervision and cross-modal feature fusion.

Method: The paper introduces Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC) to correct local misalignment using 2D object priors, Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) for noise suppression and sharp boundary transitions, and Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM) for efficient fusion of features using gated attention.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes validation dataset with an mAP of 71.5% and NDS of 73.6%.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses local and global feature misalignment issues in LiDAR-camera fusion, improving the 3D perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Turing Eye Test (TET) to evaluate perception in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using synthetic images, finding that state-of-the-art models fail at tasks intuitive for humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address whether MLLMs can perceive the world as humans do, shifting focus from reasoning to perception.

Method: Researchers designed the Turing Eye Test (TET), a perception-oriented benchmark consisting of four diagnostic tasks involving synthetic images.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with perceptual tasks that are trivial for humans, as in-context learning and language backbone training fail to improve performance. Fine-tuning the vision tower shows potential for adaptation.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs face significant gaps in vision tower generalization, preventing human-like perception. Further research is needed to enhance visual generalization methods.

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of personalizing video highlights by introducing a new dataset, HIPPO-Video, and a method called HiPHer for predicting personalized saliency scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack personalization, relying on limited content types or simple queries that fail to capture complex user preferences.

Method: HIPPO-Video dataset is created using a language model-based user simulator to generate realistic watch histories. The authors also introduce HiPHer, which predicts saliency scores leveraging these histories.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that HiPHer outperforms existing generic and query-based methods in video highlighting.

Conclusion: The work enables user-centric video highlighting through a novel dataset and method, proving its effectiveness in accommodating diverse user preferences.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dataset (ReMeX) and framework (ReMeREC) for improving multi-entity localization in images based on natural language descriptions, addressing limitations in relational reasoning and dataset quality in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on single-entity localization and fail to handle complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, hindered by a lack of quality datasets with detailed annotations.

Method: The authors construct a relation-aware dataset, ReMeX, and propose ReMeREC, a framework combining visual and textual cues. They introduce Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) for dynamic entity inference and Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) for relational reasoning. They also generate a supplementary dataset, EntityText, using large language models.

Result: ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction across four benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework offer enhanced accuracy and relational reasoning capabilities, advancing the field of multi-entity REC by addressing previous limitations in dataset quality and inter-entity relationship modeling.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalStep is a new benchmark for evaluating stepwise causal reasoning in videos, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by using strict QA protocols and multiple diagnostic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address shortcomings in video reasoning benchmarks, which fail to rigorously evaluate stepwise and causal reasoning.

Method: CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and implements strict stepwise QA protocols with distractor questions based on an error taxonomy.

Result: The benchmark includes 100 videos, 1,852 QA pairs, and seven diagnostic metrics, revealing a significant performance gap between human reasoning and current AI models.

Conclusion: CausalStep serves as a robust tool for advancing interpretable and complex video reasoning AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of pruning-based defenses in text-to-image diffusion models and introduces a new adversarial fine-tuning method to mitigate data memorization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data privacy and intellectual property concerns in text-to-image diffusion models that inadvertently memorize and replicate training data.

Method: The authors evaluate existing pruning-based defenses, explore the assumption of memorization locality, and propose an adversarial fine-tuning method to identify and neutralize replication triggers.

Result: They found that existing pruning methods are fragile, as minor prompt adjustments can still trigger data replication, and identified that memorization is not localized but distributed.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the ineffectiveness of current defenses, advocating for approaches that remove memorized content rather than suppress its retrieval, and lays the groundwork for robust mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and scarcity of high-resolution ST datasets limit broad adoption in research and clinical applications.

Method: The authors propose S2S-ST, which employs self-supervised sparser-to-sparse learning, cross-domain co-learning with natural images, and a Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) for iterative refinement.

Result: Experiments across various tissue types show S2S-ST surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy.

Conclusion: S2S-ST enables efficient and accurate ST data reconstruction using sparse inputs, lowering costs and promoting wider use in biomedical fields.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

Motivation: To address the limitations of static AI models in medical imaging by creating an agentic AI system that supports reasoning, interaction, and adaptability.

Method: The authors developed AURA, which uses Qwen-32B LLM and incorporates a modular toolbox with segmentation capabilities, counterfactual image generation, and advanced evaluation tools for enhanced image analysis and interpretability.

Conclusion: AURA demonstrates the potential of agentic AI in transforming medical imaging from static prediction models to interactive decision-support systems, paving the way for more transparent and adaptable healthcare AI solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced
state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual
interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection (LTOAD), addressing limitations in current offline methods and proposing a class-agnostic framework for online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in Anomaly Detection are insufficient for practical scenarios that require long-tailed distributed data analysis and online learning without class labels.

Method: The authors developed a class-agnostic framework for Long-Tailed Anomaly Detection (LTAD) and adapted it for online learning settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The method improved image-AUROC scores by +4.63% in offline LTAD on the MVTec dataset and achieved +0.53% in challenging long-tailed online AD settings.

Conclusion: The proposed LTOAD framework broadens the applicability of anomaly detection methods to more realistic scenarios, outperforming existing baselines while functioning without class-specific labels.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

TL;DR: The paper proposes new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true- and false-class Class Activation Maps (CAMs), achieving improved model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in prior saliency-guided training, which overlooks the role of false-class CAM in improving model generalization.

Method: The authors propose three novel saliency-guided training methods and a post-hoc tool, incorporating both true- and false-class CAMs into the training process.

Result: The proposed methods show improved generalization performance in binary classification tasks, including face detection and X-ray anomaly classification, compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Leveraging both true- and false-class CAMs enhances the effectiveness of saliency-guided training, demonstrating promising results in diverse binary tasks.

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language handshape datasets are often small and unbalanced, making it hard to train effective models; the research aims to solve this by augmenting data with synthetic samples.

Method: The paper employs an EfficientNet classifier on the RWTH dataset, augmented by synthetic images generated with ReACGAN and SPADE GAN architectures.

Result: The method improves the classification accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5% and shows generalization capability using pose-based generation on HaGRID without retraining.

Conclusion: Augmenting training data with GAN-generated images can mitigate the limitations of small and unbalanced datasets while improving performance and generalizability across different datasets.

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of reconstructing spatial maps from satellite imagery, a labor-intensive process requiring primitives-based object representation to capture the built environment accurately.

Method: The paper proposes Decoupled-PolyGCN, which incorporates geometric regularity, multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and Attraction Field Maps to enhance building footprint reconstruction.

Result: The Decoupled-PolyGCN framework outperforms existing methods by 6% in average precision (AP) and 10% in average recall (AR), showcasing its effectiveness and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable, automated solution for building footprint extraction, with applications in urban planning, disaster management, and spatial analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses improving video understanding by constructing text-based memory through video captions. Using advanced partitioning, static scene descriptions, and fine-tuned models, it aims for a more effective question-answering system over videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos are dense and complex, requiring compact yet informative textual summaries for easier analysis and reasoning using large language models.

Method: Their approach relies on progressive textual memory construction from supervised video captions, enriched with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). They fine-tuned a controllable hybrid captioner capable of alternating between scene and action captions based on input signals.

Result: The fine-tuned captioning model improved textual memory quality and efficiency, making it possible to answer a wider range of natural language video queries.

Conclusion: They demonstrated a successful system for generating detailed and organized textual summaries from videos, enhancing both captioning pipeline efficiency and querying applications.

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of current MLLMs in providing precise, temporally synchronized narrations for video content, as they often hallucinate and fail in unfamiliar contexts.

Method: VideoNarrator uses a flexible training-free pipeline that integrates off-the-shelf MLLMs and VLMs as caption generators, context providers, or validation components.

Result: Experimental results show that the pipeline improves the quality and accuracy of video captions, achieving better temporal alignment and reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: VideoNarrator enhances video comprehension and supports downstream tasks like summarization and question answering, with potential applications in advertising and marketing.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.

*Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Kendall N. Niles,Joe Tom,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Elias Ioup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys advancements in few-shot learning (FSL) for video and 3D object detection to minimize supervision needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the high cost of manual data labeling, especially for video and 3D data, this paper explores how FSL can reduce these expenses while enabling recognition of novel classes.

Method: The paper examines methods like tube proposals, temporal matching networks, and specialized point cloud networks tailored for video and 3D object detection, addressing issues like sparsity, texture scarcity, and class imbalance.

Result: FSL technologies for video utilize spatiotemporal structures, while for 3D detection, they employ strategies to manage point cloud challenges, proving their efficacy in minimizing annotation needs.

Conclusion: FSL advancements show significant promise for reducing labeling costs and enabling practical deployment in domains like video and autonomous driving by efficiently leveraging various data modalities.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.

### [73] [SDGOCC: Semantic and Depth-Guided Bird's-Eye View Transformation for 3D Multimodal Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17083)
*Zaipeng Duan,Chenxu Dang,Xuzhong Hu,Pei An,Junfeng Ding,Jie Zhan,Yunbiao Xu,Jie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDG-OCC, a novel multimodal 3D occupancy prediction network designed to overcome limitations in depth estimation and semantic exploitation in autonomous driving. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and will have an open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction rely on single modalities—cameras or LiDAR—each with significant limitations such as inaccurate depth perception and issues with occlusions.

Method: The authors propose SDG-OCC, which combines semantic and depth-guided view transformation with active knowledge distillation. Enhanced depth distribution and selective multimodal feature transfer are the core innovations for robust occupancy prediction.

Result: The SDG-OCC network achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with real-time processing capability. It performs comparably on the challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed SDG-OCC network demonstrates effective multimodal integration for accurate real-time 3D occupancy prediction, addressing key issues in autonomous driving systems. Future work includes releasing the open-source implementation.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at
https://github.com/DzpLab/SDGOCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedVLM introduces a federated fine-tuning framework for vision-language models to tackle challenges in decentralized, non-iid data settings using personalized and efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision-language models is crucial but difficult in federated environments due to decentralized, non-iid client data and privacy concerns.

Method: The FedVLM framework combines LoRA fine-tuning with a new personalized LoRA (pLoRA) approach, which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to specific client data distributions.

Result: Using the RLAIF-V dataset, pLoRA achieved a 24.5% improvement in client-specific performance over standard LoRA, showing strong local adaptation and efficient global model aggregation.

Conclusion: FedVLM is a scalable and private framework that advances personalized adaptation of vision-language models in federated learning environments, solving major data heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each
client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation
while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard
LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a
scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning VLMs in federated settings,
advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios.

*Shanshan Zhang,Siyue Wang,Tianshui Wen,Qi Zhang,Ziheng Zhou,Lingxiang Zheng,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IONext, a CNN-based inertial odometry model combining global and local motion feature extraction to outperform SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in inertial odometry struggle with local motion sensitivity and inductive biases, prompting research into CNNs with enlarged receptive fields.

Method: The study proposes DADM for selective feature aggregation and STGU for improved temporal modeling, forming the basis of the IONext model.

Result: IONext achieved up to 10% reduction in average ATE and 12% reduction in average RTE compared to SOTA models across six datasets.

Conclusion: IONext effectively addresses transformer limitations and advances the performance of inertial odometry leveraging CNN innovations.

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for classifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) in both binary and five-class settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance using transfer learning and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (a major cause of vision loss) through automated retinal image analysis, tackling challenges like class imbalance and limited training data.

Method: Utilized transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet), extensive data augmentation, and evaluation on APTOS 2019 dataset for binary and five-class DR classification.

Result: Achieved 98.9% accuracy for binary classification and 84.6% accuracy for five-class classification, along with optimal performance metrics like F1-score (98.9%) and AUC (99.4%) for binary classification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in DR diagnosis, combining high accuracy and computational efficiency, suggesting real-world applicability for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced
augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The
proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,
with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.

*Bo Fang,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Hang Chang,Gerald J. Shami,Filip Braet,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method named ScSAM to improve organelle segmentation by addressing biases and feature learning challenges using pre-trained SAM fused with Masked Autoencoder (MAE) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the morphological and distributional variability in subcellular components which produces biases in learning-based segmentation models and limits existing methods' effectiveness.

Method: The proposed method, ScSAM, fuses pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder-guided cellular prior knowledge, uses feature alignment and fusion modules, and employs a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder for subcellular categorization.

Result: ScSAM was tested on diverse subcellular image datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of effectiveness and precision.

Conclusion: By addressing biases and learning issues, ScSAM provides a more robust segmentation model for subcellular components and enhances feature diversity in the learning process.

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [78] [UNICE: Training A Universal Image Contrast Enhancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17157)
*Ruodai Cui,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents UNICE, a method for general image contrast enhancement using high-dynamic range (HDR) imagery without human labeling, achieving superior generalization and performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image contrast enhancement methods lack generalized performance across diverse tasks and datasets, highlighting the need for a universal solution.

Method: The authors collect HDR raw images, create multi-exposure sequences (MES) through fusion, and train two networks—one to generate MES from a single sRGB image and another to fuse MES into enhanced images.

Result: UNICE significantly outperforms existing contrast enhancement methods and even surpasses ground-truths in no-reference image quality metrics.

Conclusion: UNICE is a universal HDR-based method for image enhancement that eliminates the need for manual labeling while improving generalization and task-specific performance.

Abstract: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DOOMGAN, a novel generative model to address morphing attacks in visible-spectrum ocular biometrics, achieving notable improvements in realism and attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored threat of morphing attacks on visible-spectrum ocular biometrics, a growing concern for system integrity.

Method: DOOMGAN employs landmark-driven encoding of ocular anatomy, attention-guided morph synthesis, and dynamic weighting of multi-faceted losses for generating realistic morphed ocular images.

Result: DOOMGAN outperforms baseline methods by achieving over 20% higher attack success rates, 20% improved iris structure generation, and 30% better gaze consistency.

Conclusion: DOOMGAN establishes itself as an effective tool for studying and mitigating morphing attacks in visible-spectrum ocular biometrics, supported by the release of a comprehensive dataset.

Abstract: Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.

*Li Pingzhen,Xu Sheng,Chen Jing,Su Chengyue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved YOLOv8-based multi-scale defect detection model for PCBs, optimizing speed and accuracy by employing strategies like network lightweighting, adaptive pruning, and enhanced loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust real-time PCB defect detection system capable of addressing the challenges of high accuracy and speed for tiny defects, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Method: The method optimizes YOLOv8 by integrating strategies like Ghost-HGNetv2 for the backbone, C2f-Faster in the neck, and a new GCDetect head. It reduces computational cost through GroupConv weight sharing, adaptive pruning, and a novel boundary loss function Inner-MPDIoU.

Result: The improved model achieves mAP0.5 of 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 of 75.18%, outperforming YOLOv8n by 10.13% in mAP0.5:0.9.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance in balancing defect detection accuracy and speed through innovative optimization strategies, proving its efficacy in PCB defect detection applications.

Abstract: With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.

*Linghe Meng,Jiarun Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two networks for assessing AI-generated content quality, targeting both visual perception and semantic understanding via multi-level feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing AI-generated content quality are limited by their reliance on single-level visual features, making them unable to effectively handle complex image distortions.

Method: The authors propose a multi-level visual representation paradigm comprising feature extraction, hierarchical fusion, and joint aggregation, implemented in two networks: MGLF-Net for perceptual quality and MPEF-Net for Text-to-Image correspondence.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that the proposed networks excel on benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness in assessing both perceptual quality and semantic correspondence of AI-generated images.

Conclusion: The study validates the proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm as an effective approach to improving the quality evaluation of AI-generated content.

Abstract: The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.

TL;DR: This research focuses on analyzing lesion shape in dermoscopic images to facilitate melanoma diagnosis. It combines supervised learning with a CNN-based SVM classifier for geometric assessment and feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid non-experts in diagnosing melanoma by offering insights into asymmetric lesion shapes through advanced image analysis techniques.

Method: Initial labeling of a dataset using clinical assessments of symmetry, followed by supervised learning. A pre-trained CNN extracts features which are used in a multiclass SVM classifier. Geometry-based and CNN-based experiments were conducted.

Result: Achieved 99.00% detection rate for asymmetric lesions in geometry-based analysis and high performance (94% Kappa Score, 95% Macro F1-score, 97% Weighted F1-score) for lesion shape classification using CNN-based analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide highly accurate tools for detecting and classifying dermatological asymmetric lesions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

### [83] [Vec2Face+ for Face Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17192)
*Haiyu Wu,Jaskirat Singh,Sicong Tian,Liang Zheng,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vec2Face+, a generative model for producing synthetic face training datasets, which has demonstrated better performance than traditional datasets like CASIA-WebFace in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address the limitations in existing synthetic face dataset generation techniques, which often struggle with maintaining intra-class identity consistency while increasing intra-class variation.

Method: The proposed Vec2Face+ model employs three main strategies: generating well-separated identities via careful vector sampling, using AttrOP for general attribute variations, and employing a LoRA-based pose control for efficient and identity-preserving image generation.

Result: The authors generated synthetic datasets VFace10K, VFace100K, and VFace300K, achieving state-of-the-art face recognition accuracy on various real-world benchmarks and surpassing the CASIA-WebFace dataset in some cases. The study also found challenges like significant biases in models trained on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets, when designed properly, can surpass real-world training datasets in specific face recognition tasks; however, concerns like verification accuracy and bias remain open for further investigation.

Abstract: When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation.

*Jooyeol Yun,Heng Wang,Yotaro Shimose,Jaegul Choo,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DesignLab introduces an iterative design-review and correction approach using fine-tuned large language models to help non-experts create polished presentation slides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify the slide design process for non-experts who struggle with complex visual choices and current tools that lack iterative refinement capabilities.

Method: The approach involves decomposing the design process into two distinct roles: a reviewer detecting design errors and a contributor correcting them. Iterative loops refine drafts, supported by fine-tuned large language models trained using controlled perturbations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DesignLab significantly outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by producing higher-quality and professional slides.

Conclusion: DesignLab leverages the iterative nature of the design process to improve output quality, providing an innovative solution for non-experts in slide design.

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design that improves efficiency and accuracy compared to manual labor-intensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design of dental crowns is labor-intensive for dental technicians, necessitating a more efficient and automated solution.

Method: A voxel-based framework (VBCD) is employed, incorporating a coarse-to-fine approach, distance-aware supervision, curvature and margin penalty loss, and a positional prompt leveraging the FDI tooth numbering system.

Result: The approach was evaluated on a large dataset of intraoral scans, outperforming existing methods in crown design accuracy and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed VBCD framework serves as a robust and effective automated solution for personalized and precise dental crown design.

Abstract: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD
framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral
scans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware
supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a
large-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach
outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized
dental crown design.

*Fatemeh Hasanzadeh Fard,Sanaz Hasanzadeh Fard,Mehdi Jonoobi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning solution using the YOLOv5 algorithm for accurate timber log size estimation from standard RGB images in real-world industrial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to replace traditional, slow, and error-prone manual wood identification with an automated, cost-effective, and accurate solution for industrial applications.

Method: The YOLOv5 object detection algorithm was fine-tuned using the TimberSeg 1.0 dataset to estimate timber log thickness from bounding-box dimensions in RGB images captured under typical working conditions.

Result: The proposed model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, proving reliable timber log detection with modest computational resources.

Conclusion: This solution is lightweight, scalable, and suitable for integration into industrial workflows, offering benefits for inventory management and sorting, especially in small and medium-scale operations.

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PIG-Nav, which enhances vision-based robotic navigation by improving pretraining strategies, achieving significant performance improvements in various environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization, transferability, and zero-shot performance in vision-based robotic navigation using pretrained models, addressing current limitations in such models.

Method: PIG-Nav incorporates two critical design elements: early-fusion network architecture with Vision Transformers (ViTs) and auxiliary tasks to enhance navigation learning. Additionally, a novel data preprocessing pipeline is introduced to create large-scale labeled training datasets from gameplay videos.

Result: The model shows an average improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings across both simulation and real-world environments over prior navigation models.

Conclusion: PIG-Nav sets a new state-of-the-art for pretrained vision-based navigation models, reducing fine-tuning data requirements while maintaining competitive performance, making it viable for real-world applications with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.

### [88] [MaskedCLIP: Bridging the Masked and CLIP Space for Semi-Supervised Medical Vision-Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17239)
*Lei Zhu,Jun Zhou,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'MaskedCLIP,' a semi-supervised vision-language pre-training framework that combines paired and unpaired image data to enhance foundation model learning for generalizable image features. It is tested on retinal image analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of existing foundation models that rely exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data, which restricts their ability to learn richer image features.

Method: The proposed 'MaskedCLIP' uses a combination of masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training. It incorporates a bridge transformer to connect the masked feature space with the CLIP feature space and includes a masked knowledge distillation loss to transfer semantic knowledge between feature spaces.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved generalizability and performance on downstream tasks in retinal image analysis, showcasing both effectiveness and data efficiency.

Conclusion: This framework leverages the strengths of paired and unpaired image data to learn more comprehensive and generalizable image features, advancing the capabilities of foundation models in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models for distinguishing real images from AI-generated images, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance with robustness against image degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively address the growing influx of AI-generated content and the need for robust methods to differentiate these from real images.

Method: Utilizes IQA models that capture image statistics, and trains a two-layer network on their feature space to classify real versus AI-generated images.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in AI image detection and proves robust against various image degradations.

Conclusion: IQA models, combined with a simple classifier, can effectively distinguish between real and generative AI images, offering a robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.

*Ruodai Cui,Li Niu,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method is introduced, requiring no manual data annotation, improving generalizability, and enhancing low-level vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of current exposure correction methods, including the need for labor-intensive data annotation, poor generalizability, and degradation in low-level vision task performance.

Method: The proposed UEC leverages an emulated Image Signal Processing pipeline with freely available paired data, eliminating manual annotation. Additionally, a large-scale Radiometry Correction Dataset is introduced to support unsupervised learning. The method also uses a transformation function with significantly fewer parameters compared to supervised methods.

Result: The UEC approach outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods in detail preservation and achieves higher performance in downstream tasks like edge detection, with just 0.01% of the parameters.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that UEC is effective for exposure correction, efficient in resource usage, and beneficial for downstream low-level vision tasks, providing a robust alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods
[12], while utilizing only 0.01% of their parameters. Our work further
investigates the broader impact of exposure correction on downstream tasks,
including edge detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the
adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features. The source code and

*Asir Saadat,Syem Aziz,Shahriar Mahmud,Abdullah Ibne Masud Mahi,Sabbir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how Visual Question Answering (VQA) models handle unanswerable questions using a new dataset, VisionTrap, which includes various unreal and logically unanswerable scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to evaluate whether VQA models can recognize their limitations and abstain from answering when faced with unanswerable questions, which has been underexplored.

Method: The proposed method introduces a specialized dataset, VisionTrap, consisting of unanswerable questions based on images with hybrid entities, impossible scenarios, or non-existent figures, to test VQA models’ performance.

Result: The study reveals that existing VQA models often attempt to answer unanswerable questions, showcasing their inability to acknowledge knowledge limitations.

Conclusion: Including logically unanswerable questions in evaluation benchmarks is crucial to test whether VQA models can effectively abstain from responding in such scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.

TL;DR: PolarAnything leverages a diffusion-based generative framework to create photorealistic and physically accurate polarization images from a single RGB image, without requiring extensive 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited accessibility of polarization cameras and the reliance of existing simulators on extensive 3D asset collections hinder broader applications of polarization images.

Method: The paper proposes a diffusion-based generative framework inspired by pretrained diffusion models, incorporating a representation strategy to maintain fidelity in polarization properties.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the model generates high-quality polarization images and supports downstream tasks like shape reconstruction via polarization.

Conclusion: PolarAnything advances the synthesis of polarization images, removing the dependency on 3D assets while providing photorealism and physical accuracy, aiding applications like image enhancement and 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.

TL;DR: This paper improves license plate recognition by combining a lightweight visual encoder, a text decoder, a customized dataset, and a perspective correction network to achieve high recognition accuracy and strong practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges created by diverse license plate types and imaging conditions for open environment recognition tasks.

Method: The paper uses a lightweight visual encoder paired with a text decoder in a pre-training framework. It constructs a synthetic dataset for single and double-line license plates and introduces a perspective correction network (PTN) for improved recognition stability and accuracy.

Result: The approach achieves 99.34% accuracy on corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance, 99.58% under fine localization disturbance, and 98.70% on double-line license plates with 167 frames per second processing speed.

Conclusion: The proposed solution demonstrates high recognition accuracy, fast processing speed, and practical utility, addressing key limitations of previous methods in open environment license plate recognition.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.

*Huanli Zhuo,Leilei Ma,Haifeng Zhao,Shiwei Zhou,Dengdi Sun,Yanping Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FA-SAM is a framework to generalize SAM for medical image segmentation by addressing challenges in domain-specific prompt dependency and incorrect prompt issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the domain shift and manual prompt dependency issues in SAM-based medical image segmentation models, and to improve their utility in clinical applications.

Method: The FA-SAM introduces an AGM branch with a SUFM module for auto-generating prompts and an IPEF module to integrate multiscale embeddings for better segmentation.

Result: Experiments on prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate that FA-SAM delivers effective performance and addresses domain-specific and poor prompt challenges.

Conclusion: FA-SAM successfully enables SAM to perform fully automated medical image segmentation and mitigates issues arising from inadequate prompts.

Abstract: Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PointLAMA, a framework enhancing global and local modeling of 3D point clouds using lightweight modules and task-aware serialization for improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba's state-space model efficiently handles global sequence modeling but lacks local inductive bias, limiting its ability to capture detailed 3D geometric features.

Method: PointLAMA employs task-aware serialization (Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert curves), a hybrid encoder combining Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a conditional diffusion mechanism for denoising feature sequences during pretraining.

Result: Experimental results show PointLAMA achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets with reduced parameters and computational costs.

Conclusion: PointLAMA effectively balances efficiency and performance in point cloud pretraining, addressing limitations in Mamba's local modeling while retaining its strengths in global sequence modeling.

Abstract: Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.

*Songshuo Lu,Hua Wang,Zhi Chen,Yaohua Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), a framework eliminating the separation between reward and policy models in language alignment pipelines, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large-scale alignment pipelines are complex and resource-intensive, with separate reward and policy models causing performance limits due to a static reward signal.

Method: URPO unifies reward modeling and policy optimization within a single model and training phase, leveraging Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize alignment data in a generative format.

Result: Experiments show URPO achieves higher instruction-following scores (AlpacaEval: 44.84) and reasoning benchmarks, while cultivating a superior internal evaluator with a RewardBench score of 85.15.

Conclusion: URPO simplifies alignment pipelines, fostering co-evolutionary dynamics between generation and evaluation, significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of aligned language models.

Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of costly and complex setups for monitoring industrial assembly processes, especially with limited visual sensors.

Method: Integration of multiple machine learning models and timestamp-based state information to monitor and provide real-time feedback during assembly processes.

Result: Achieved an average accuracy exceeding 92% in detecting assembly stages, with improved error detection and visualization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach is cost-effective, reduces hardware dependency, and enhances the practicality for dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CasP, a new feature matching method leveraging cascaded correspondence priors for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-dense feature matching methods struggle with accuracy and efficiency due to reliance on a global search across feature maps.

Method: The paper decomposes the matching process into two phases using a region-based selective cross-attention mechanism and restricts search areas in the second phase.

Result: The proposed CasP method achieves higher accuracy, computational efficiency (2.2× speedup compared to ELoFTR), and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CasP demonstrates strong potential for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications in SLAM and UAV systems, combining geometric estimation superiority and computational gains.

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

Method: The approach integrates VLMs to provide a contextual prior for narrowing the search space and combines this with a retrieval and re-ranking mechanism to find geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed previous methods in geo-localization benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of up to 4.51% at the street level and up to 13.52% at the city level.

Conclusion: The hybrid system successfully leverages VLMs with retrieval methods to create a scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization solution.

Abstract: Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.

*Jie Wang,Zhendong Yang,Liansong Zong,Xiaobo Zhang,Dexian Wang,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2P-MMT, a robust multimodal machine translation approach using a dual-branch prompting framework, achieving better performance using reconstructed images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art multimodal methods depend heavily on paired image-text inputs during inference and are susceptible to irrelevant visual noise, diminishing robustness and applicability.

Method: The framework utilizes a diffusion model to generate reconstructed images for translation tasks, employs a dual-branch prompting strategy, and introduces a distributional alignment loss to improve modality bridging and inference consistency.

Result: Experiments on the Multi30K dataset show that D2P-MMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy.

Conclusion: D2P-MMT represents a robust advancement in vision-guided translation, overcoming limitations of visual noise and reliance on authentic imagery, and enhancing cross-modal interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Chao He,Jianqiang Ren,Jianjing Xiang,Xiejie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CartoonAlive, a method for creating expressive Live2D digital humans from a single portrait image in under 30 seconds. The approach emphasizes simplicity and interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans, which offer efficiency and expressiveness over 3D models and traditional 2D video-based solutions, focusing especially on the Live2D format.

Method: CartoonAlive uses the concept of shape basis from 3D face modeling to create facial blendshapes for Live2D. It estimates blendshape weights using facial keypoints extracted from an input image, enabling rapid and accurate generation of Live2D characters.

Result: The method produces high-quality, expressive, and interactive Live2D digital humans from a single input image in less than half a minute, resembling the original portrait image closely.

Conclusion: CartoonAlive provides a scalable and efficient solution for creating 2D cartoon-style digital humans, enabling dynamic and interactive virtual characters, and expanding opportunities in digital content creation.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual
character animation. The project homepage is

### [102] [PARTE: Part-Guided Texturing for 3D Human Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17332)
*Hyeongjin Nam,Donghwan Kim,Gyeongsik Moon,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARTE, a method using 3D human part segmentation to improve texture alignment in 3D human reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human reconstruction methods struggle with misaligned textures across distinct human parts, failing to accurately represent structural coherence.

Method: The method includes two components: (1) PartSegmenter, a module to infer human part labels from a reconstructed textureless surface, and (2) PartTexturer, a module leveraging pre-trained image generation networks for texture alignment.

Result: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in producing accurate textures in 3D human reconstructions.

Conclusion: PARTE effectively addresses texture misalignment issues in 3D human reconstruction by leveraging human part segmentation as a core guide.

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

Abstract: Real-world 3D scene-level scans offer realism and can enable better
real-world generalizability for downstream applications. However, challenges
such as data volume, diverse annotation formats, and tool compatibility limit
their use. This paper demonstrates a methodology to effectively leverage these
scans and their annotations. We propose a unified annotation integration using
USD, with application-specific USD flavors. We identify challenges in utilizing
holistic real-world scan datasets and present mitigation strategies. The
efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through two downstream applications:
LLM-based scene editing, enabling effective LLM understanding and adaptation of
the data (80% success), and robotic simulation, achieving an 87% success rate
in policy learning.

TL;DR: The study introduces a Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework for detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance without relying on manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the detection of weak moving targets, which is hindered by low signal energy, limited spatial extent, and challenging background clutter.

Method: The TPS framework reformulates the detection task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem and employs a Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) integrated with a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module. It further utilizes a graph-based trajectory mining strategy for increased accuracy.

Result: Experiments on a low signal-to-noise ratio (low-SNR) dataset show superior performance compared to existing methods in weak target detection, achieving real-time operation at over 1000 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed TPS framework is an efficient, annotation-free solution for weak target detection, demonstrating significant potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRIX, a scalable, efficient end-to-end autonomous driving model that uses only camera data, overcoming reliance on large models and expensive sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable autonomous driving solution for mass-market vehicles equipped only with cameras, eliminating dependency on LiDAR sensors or expensive BEV representation.

Method: PRIX uses a visual feature extractor and generative planning head to predict trajectories directly from raw pixel inputs. It features the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT) for enhancing visual features.

Result: PRIX achieves state-of-the-art results on NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching larger multimodal planners in performance but with faster inference and smaller model size.

Conclusion: PRIX is a practical and scalable solution for autonomous driving, offering efficient, camera-only planning without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and

*Xuzhi Wang,Xinran Wu,Song Wang,Lingdong Kong,Ziping Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage framework called MonoMRN for Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) that achieves improved performance by incorporating Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Units and a distance attention projection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings of existing single-stage MSSC methods, such as suboptimal performance in complex scenes and issues with inaccurate depth estimation.

Method: Introduced a two-stage framework involving coarse MSSC and a Masked Recurrent Network, incorporating Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Units with mask updating and sparse computation techniques, along with distance attention projection to reduce projection errors.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and SemanticKITTI datasets, demonstrated effectiveness in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, and showed robustness under disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed MonoMRN framework significantly improves MSSC accuracy and resilience, addressing limitations of prior methods; the source code is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.

### [107] [DeMo++: Motion Decoupling for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17342)
*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeMo++, a framework to enhance motion forecasting and planning for autonomous driving. It improves upon the traditional trajectory prediction methods, focusing on diverse motion intentions and finely detailed spatiotemporal evolution to ensure optimal and collision-free navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional one-query-one-trajectory methods for predicting multi-modal trajectories struggle with capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to collisions or inefficiencies. The need for a more robust and comprehensive framework prompted the development of DeMo++.

Method: DeMo++ decouples motion estimation into diverse holistic motion intentions and fine-grained spatiotemporal states. It incorporates a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism to explore interrelations between neighboring motions. A hybrid model of Attention and Mamba is proposed for efficient scene understanding and trajectory modeling.

Result: DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including Argoverse 2, nuScenes (motion forecasting), nuPlan (motion planning), and NAVSIM (end-to-end planning).

Conclusion: DeMo++ addresses the limitations of conventional methods, offering better trajectory diversity and dynamic state refinement. Its innovative framework promises improvements in safety and operational efficiency for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Motivation: To bridge the gap between asynchronous event camera data and human language, enabling better object grounding and comprehension in dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Develop Talk2Event, a dataset with over 30,000 referring expressions enriched by four attributes, and propose EventRefer, a framework using a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE) to fuse attribute representations dynamically.

Result: EventRefer achieves consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios including event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion.

Conclusion: The research establishes a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware, and language-driven perception, aiming for impactful applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,
making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these
asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce
Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object
grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we
provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four
grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to
other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully
exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding
framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a
Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different
modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art
baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope
our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,
temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and
autonomy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMRL addresses challenges in multimodal representation learning by achieving alignment of multiple modalities through a stable, anchor-independent approach focusing on the dominant singular value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional multimodal representation methods, including fixed anchor points and instability in optimization processes, and to enable stable simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities.

Method: PMRL uses a novel framework based on optimizing the dominant singular value of the representation matrix and employing a softmax-based loss function, alongside instance-wise contrastive regularization to maintain separability and prevent representation collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PMRL outperforms traditional baseline methods across various multimodal tasks, ensuring better multimodal alignment and stability.

Conclusion: PMRL provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective solution for stable, anchor-free multimodal representation learning, demonstrating superior performance and general applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

Abstract: With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered
significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets

autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,
the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations
collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby
facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well
as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel
cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the
well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves
perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric

resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,
providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging
cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing large-scale models for food image segmentation, which require excessive computational resources and are unsuitable for industrial deployment.

Method: Introduced Swin-TUNA, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach that uses multiscale trainable adapters within Swin Transformer to adapt hierarchical features efficiently. The method updates only 4% of the model parameters.

Result: Swin-TUNA achieves mIoU of 50.56% on the FoodSeg103 dataset and 74.94% on the UECFoodPix Complete dataset, outperforming FoodSAM model with a 98.7% reduction in parameters.

Conclusion: Swin-TUNA provides an efficient, high-performing, and lightweight solution for food image segmentation, exhibiting strong generalization and faster convergence even in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for
assembling lightweight food image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging active learning to significantly reduce annotation costs in training semantically-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), achieving a 2X cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantically-aware NeRFs require expensive pixel-level labels for training, posing a significant challenge for practical applications due to high annotation costs.

Method: The authors investigate different active learning strategies and granularity levels, and introduce a novel approach that incorporates 3D geometric constraints to optimize sample selection.

Result: Results reveal that the proposed active learning methods achieve over 2X reduction in annotation costs compared to random sampling while effectively training semantically-aware NeRFs.

Conclusion: Active learning is a promising solution to alleviate annotation burdens, making semantically-aware NeRFs more feasible for real-world applications.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,
achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random
sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models require substantial annotated data for tasks like semantic segmentation, which is costly and time-consuming to generate, especially for semiconductor XRM defect identification.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance when evaluated on XRM scans of high bandwidth memory structures, overcoming challenges like domain shift and class imbalance.

Conclusion: Active learning combined with contrastive pretraining and rareness-aware sample acquisition effectively reduces annotation burden and enhances performance for visual analysis of semiconductor XRM scans.

Abstract: The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [114] [Exploring Spatial Diversity for Region-based Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17367)
*Lile Cai,Xun Xu,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active learning framework for semantic segmentation that emphasizes selecting spatially diverse and uncertain image regions for labeling, reducing annotation costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation for semantic segmentation is costly due to the dense labeling required. The goal is to minimize this cost while retaining model performance, using active learning techniques that focus on selecting and labeling only the most informative regions of images.

Method: The paper introduces a unified optimization framework that enforces local spatial diversity alongside traditional active learning criteria (e.g., uncertainty) to select informative image regions for labeling.

Result: Experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets show that the proposed approach achieves $95\%$ performance of fully supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of labeled pixels, outperforming other region-based active learning methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial diversity in region-based active learning for semantic segmentation significantly improves performance while reducing labeling effort and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all
state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic
segmentation.

### [115] [SFUOD: Source-Free Unknown Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17373)
*Keon-Hee Park,Seun-An Choe,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) and proposes a new scenario, SFUOD, which enables detecting both predefined and undefined objects. The framework CollaPAUL is introduced and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of traditional Source-Free Object Detection, which can only detect predefined objects, by introducing an approach that can handle both known and unknown objects in the target domain.

Method: The proposed method, CollaPAUL, combines collaborative tuning (merging cross-domain attention knowledge) and principal axes-based pseudo-labeling to adapt the object detector and label unknown objects.

Result: CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for the newly introduced SFUOD scenario and demonstrates effectiveness in experiments.

Conclusion: The new scenario SFUOD and the CollaPAUL framework advance the capabilities of source-free object detection by addressing the detection of both known and unknown objects, proving practical and effective in various tests.

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

### [116] [A Conditional Probability Framework for Compositional Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17377)
*Peng Wu,Qiuxia Lai,Hao Fang,Guo-Sen Xie,Yilong Yin,Xiankai Lu,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) to model attribute-object dependencies, enhancing performance on unseen object-attribute combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CZSL methods treat attributes and objects as independent entities, ignoring their semantic constraints and contextual dependencies, which limits recognition of unseen combinations.

Method: The authors propose decomposing the composition probability into object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood. Textual descriptors and a cross-attention mechanism are used to improve object and attribute learning, ensuring better contextual alignment.

Result: Experiments across several CZSL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in recognizing unseen compositions.

Conclusion: By modeling attribute-object dependencies explicitly and integrating contextual learning mechanisms, this method offers an effective solution for CZSL, addressing a fundamental challenge in the field.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code
is available at here.

*Xinyu Liu,Hengyu Liu,Cheng Wang,Tianming Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EndoGen, a conditional endoscopic video generation framework with innovative strategies for generating high-quality content and enhancing medical tasks like polyp segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static imaging or unconditional approaches in endoscopic video generation lack dynamic precision and clinical relevance.

Method: The authors propose an autoregressive model with Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) for global dependency modeling and Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) for richer content generation.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness in producing conditionally guided, high-quality endoscopic videos and improving polyp segmentation.

Conclusion: EndoGen advances endoscopic video generation, making it more clinically relevant and impactful by addressing prior limitations and enhancing medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

### [118] [HiProbe-VAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Hidden States Probing in Tuning-Free Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17394)
*Zhaolin Cai,Fan Li,Ziwei Zheng,Yanjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiProbe-VAD leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) without fine-tuning, offering an efficient and scalable solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods are computationally demanding and rely heavily on extensive labeled datasets, limiting their practicality.

Method: The framework introduces Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) to identify and use the most informative intermediate hidden states of pre-trained MLLMs for anomaly detection, followed by a lightweight anomaly scorer and localization module.

Result: HiProbe-VAD outperformed existing training-free and most traditional methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets and demonstrated strong cross-model generalization.

Conclusion: The HiProbe-VAD framework unlocks the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for VAD and offers a practical, scalable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

### [119] [HLFormer: Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Hyperbolic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17402)
*Li Jun,Wang Jinpeng,Tan Chaolei,Lian Niu,Chen Long,Zhang Min,Wang Yaowei,Xia Shu-Tao,Chen Bin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HLFormer, a novel framework using hyperbolic space for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) to better model hierarchical semantics in videos compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PRVR methods face challenges in effectively capturing hierarchical semantics in videos using Euclidean space, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space learning with Lorentz and Euclidean Attention Blocks, dynamic feature fusion, and Partial Order Preservation Loss to improve PRVR.

Result: HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PRVR as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space modeling, as implemented in HLFormer, enhances PRVR by better capturing video-text hierarchies and improving retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

*Ayce Idil Aytekin,Chuqiao Li,Diogo Luvizon,Rishabh Dabral,Martin Oswald,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoviCam, a new non-synthetic dataset, and PhysDynPose, a physics-based method for robust human pose tracking in dynamic camera settings and non-flat environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human pose tracking methods struggle with camera motion and non-flat scenes and are often tested on less realistic datasets.

Method: MoviCam provides ground-truth data for moving cameras and human-scene interactions; PhysDynPose integrates kinematic estimations, SLAM for camera trajectories, and a scene-aware physics optimizer.

Result: PhysDynPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robustness in dynamic camera and non-planar environments, as shown using the MoviCam benchmark.

Conclusion: The combination of a realistic dataset (MoviCam) and a physics-based approach (PhysDynPose) addresses significant limitations in monocular pose tracking research.

Abstract: Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.

*Farnaz Khun Jush,Steffen Vogler,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-MIR, a novel re-ranking approach for medical image retrieval, eliminating pre-segmentation and enhancing context-aware efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in managing the growing repository of medical images and the need for efficient retrieval systems for radiologists.

Method: It presents a novel CBIR framework using C-MIR, which adapts ColBERT's late interaction principle for 3D medical imaging, tested across multiple tumor sites and configurations.

Result: C-MIR demonstrated improved performance in tumor flagging, particularly for colon and lung tumors, while eliminating reliance on pre-enriched data.

Conclusion: The work advances CBIR research, showing promise for enhancing diagnostic processes in clinical practices without the need for expensive data preparation.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAPRI-CT, a causal-aware deep learning model that optimizes CT image quality by integrating imaging data and acquisition metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the clinical challenge of balancing high CT image quality with minimized radiation exposure by leveraging a causal-aware framework.

Method: The framework employs an ensemble of VAEs to extract features from CT data and metadata, enabling predictive modeling and counterfactual simulations of scan parameters.

Result: CAPRI-CT demonstrates strong predictive performance in modeling signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and provides actionable insights for efficient CT protocol design.

Conclusion: By improving prediction accuracy and interpretability, CAPRI-CT aids in optimizing CT protocols, reducing the need for repeated scans, and enhancing patient safety.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

*Yehao Lu,Minghe Weng,Zekang Xiao,Rui Jiang,Wei Su,Guangcong Zheng,Ping Lu,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to create Dynamic-DINO, a dynamic, real-time open-vocabulary object detection framework outperforming existing models with efficient tuning and activation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture can be applied to smaller vision-language models for real-time open-vocabulary object detection, aiming to harness large-scale datasets more effectively.

Method: The paper introduces Dynamic-DINO by extending Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge into a dynamic inference model. It employs MoE-Tuning, granularity decomposition to divide the FFN into smaller expert networks, a pre-trained weight allocation strategy, and specific router initialization to optimize performance.

Result: Dynamic-DINO outperforms Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, even with less pretraining (using only 1.56M open-source data instead of the proprietary Grounding20M dataset).

Conclusion: Dynamic-DINO demonstrates the potential of MoE architectures for efficient and high-performance real-time object detection, offering an effective approach with reduced dependency on proprietary datasets.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new training-free framework called DYSCO enhances Human-Object Interaction detection by leveraging Vision-Language Models for improved interaction representation and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI detection methods require labor-intensive annotations and struggle with scalability for rare interactions in new domains.

Method: DYSCO employs a multimodal registry combining visual cues and textual features, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism for semantic alignment and adaptive weighting.

Result: Experimental results show DYSCO surpasses training-free state-of-art methods and competes with training-based approaches, especially excelling in rare interactions.

Conclusion: DYSCO provides a robust and nuanced solution for HOI detection, demonstrating effectiveness without requiring training and improving generalization for rare interactions.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

### [125] [ERMV: Editing 4D Robotic Multi-view images to enhance embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17462)
*Chang Nie,Guangming Wang,Zhe Lie,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ERMV, a novel data augmentation framework to edit 4D multi-view sequential images for robotic imitation learning, addressing challenges in consistency, efficiency, and semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic imitation learning faces limitations due to the scarcity and high cost of high-quality 4D multi-view sequential images for training Vision-Language-Action models.

Method: ERMV introduces three innovations: (1) Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) for spatio-temporal consistency, (2) Sparse Spatio-Temporal module to reduce computational cost, and (3) Multimodal LLM feedback mechanism for correcting inconsistencies during editing.

Result: ERMV significantly improves the robustness and generalization of Vision-Language-Action models in both simulated and real-world settings via augmented data.

Conclusion: ERMV provides an effective solution to enabling scalable and consistent data augmentation for enhancing embodied intelligence policies in robotics.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

*Elena Pitta,Tom Kouwenhoven,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the effectiveness of Visual Entailment (VE) in assessing vision-language understanding using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model, across settings such as zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether the VE task is a reliable tool for probing vision-language understanding in multimodal models, and to understand its strengths and limitations.

Method: Experiments were conducted in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, analyzing impacts of prompt design, labeling order, and presence of visual information. Explanation-based evaluations further probed reasoning processes.

Result: Three-shot inference demonstrated superior performance over zero-shot, but more in-context examples introduced noise. Fine-tuning achieved 83.3% accuracy and competitive explanation scores, although vision grounding was challenged.

Conclusion: VE has utility as a diagnostic task but also reveals limitations, such as reliance on linguistic priors and inadequate visual grounding, pointing to needs for improved evaluation methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to

*Chuang Chen,Xiaolin Qin,Jing Hu,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRMambaV2 is a new method for enhancing the upsampling of sparse LiDAR point clouds by leveraging biomimetic attention mechanisms, dual-branch network architectures, and progressive loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of upsampling sparse and complex 3D LiDAR point clouds, which are critical for autonomous driving applications.

Method: The authors propose SRMambaV2, utilizing a 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism for sparse areas, a dual-branch network architecture, and a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function for better detail reconstruction.

Result: SRMambaV2 shows superior performance in experimental results, excelling in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for upsampling sparse automotive point clouds.

Conclusion: SRMambaV2 underscores its practical value by achieving robust geometric reconstruction and better detail accuracy for sparse point cloud data in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

*Hugues Roy,Reuben Dorent,Ninon Burgos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoBFN, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework using Bayesian flow networks, sets a new benchmark in detecting Alzheimer's disease-related anomalies in FDG PET images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective unsupervised methods to identify neuroimaging anomalies, aiding in the detection and diagnosis of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

Method: AnoBFN leverages Bayesian flow networks combining diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. It incorporates conditional image generation and recursive feedback to improve subject-specific anomaly detection.

Result: AnoBFN outperformed state-of-the-art methods such as beta-VAE, f-AnoGAN, and AnoDDPM by achieving higher accuracy in detection and reduced false positive rates.

Conclusion: AnoBFN showcases the potential of Bayesian flow networks for medical imaging applications, offering improved anomaly detection performance and paving the way for applications in neurological disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

*Minglong Xue,Aoxiang Ning,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Mingliang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel network named DFDNet that drastically enhances the removal of light flare artifacts in nighttime photography using frequency-domain techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime images frequently suffer from flare artifacts caused by strong light sources, severely affecting their quality and downstream tasks. Existing techniques have limitations in removing these artifacts effectively.

Method: The proposed method, DFDNet, integrates two key modules: (1) Global Dynamic Frequency-domain Guidance (GDFG) for decoupling flare artifacts from content in the frequency domain, and (2) Local Detail Guidance Module (LDGM) utilizing contrastive learning to preserve local details and structural integrity.

Result: Experimental results showcase DFDNet’s superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for large-scale flare removal and fine-grained restoration.

Conclusion: DFDNet effectively addresses flare artifact removal in nighttime images using frequency-domain approaches and enhances visual quality, offering substantial improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

### [131] [Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17511)
*Jiajun Luo,Yicheng Xiao,Jianru Xu,Yangxiu You,Rongwei Lu,Chen Tang,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CompactFusion, a compression framework aimed at reducing communication overhead during parallel diffusion model inference while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally demanding, necessitating multi-accelerator setups for real-time applications. However, substantial communication overhead caused by exchanging large activations between devices hinders scalability and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose 'Residual Compression,' which transmits only step-wise activation differences (residuals) and introduces lightweight error feedback to counteract error accumulation. This approach minimizes redundant data, leveraging temporal redundancy in activations.

Result: CompactFusion achieves a 3.0x speedup while boosting fidelity on 4xL20 and a 6.7x speedup on slow networks compared to prior methods. It supports communication-intensive parallel strategies and maintains high generation quality.

Conclusion: CompactFusion sets a new benchmark for diffusion inference by improving efficiency, lowering latency, and enhancing model fidelity without requiring extensive changes to implementation pipelines. The method is applicable across various diffusion models and parallel configurations.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

*Tian Guo,Hui Yuan,Xiaolong Mao,Shiqi Jiang,Raouf Hamzaoui,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an STQE network to enhance the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds using spatial-temporal correlations, achieving significant quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective use of spatial-temporal correlations in enhancing the quality of compressed dynamic point clouds.

Method: The authors propose a network with a motion compensation module, temporal attention, spatial feature aggregation, and a tailored joint loss function targeting precision in spatial-temporal attributes.

Result: The proposed STQE network achieved improvements of up to 0.855 dB in delta PSNR and BD-rate reductions for different color components, demonstrating significant gains in compression efficiency.

Conclusion: The STQE network efficiently exploits spatial-temporal correlations, providing measurable enhancements in compressed dynamic point cloud quality while reducing typical over-smoothing effects.

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%

*Liwen Liu,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPT is a multi-modal multi-task pre-training framework designed to better understand 3D point clouds using token-level reconstruction, point-level reconstruction, and multi-modal contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal pre-training methods primarily rely on single tasks, limiting their ability to leverage abundant information from diverse tasks and hindering downstream performance.

Method: MMPT introduces three tasks: Token-level reconstruction to recover masked tokens, Point-level reconstruction to predict masked point positions, and Multi-modal contrastive learning to align features across 3D and 2D modalities.

Result: MMPT outperformed state-of-the-art methods in various discriminative and generative tasks on common benchmarks, showing effective transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances point cloud understanding without relying on 3D annotations, making it scalable for large datasets and useful across diverse domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

*Xide Xu,Sandesh Kamath,Muhammad Atif Butt,Bogdan Raducanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HAAD, a novel adversarial attack method targeting diffusion models to degrade their performance, addressing privacy concerns with customized image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the privacy risks associated with diffusion models, which can unauthorizedly modify private content due to their ability to generate customized images.

Method: Introducing HAAD and its efficient variant HAAD-KV, which use adversarial attacks in the latent h-space of diffusion models to craft perturbations that prevent effective image generation.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that both HAAD and HAAD-KV are effective and efficient measures to protect private content from misuse in diffusion models.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method to improve hard-label black-box adversarial attacks by leveraging transfer-based priors and optimizing gradient estimation, resulting in significant gains in query efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in hard-label adversarial attacks, particularly the high cost associated with the optimization process and gradient estimation when only the top-1 predicted label is available.

Method: The paper introduces a prior-guided approach that integrates transfer-based priors from surrogate models with random directions for gradient estimation. The method focuses on improving the efficiency of ray search by effectively approximating the projection of the true gradient onto a subspace defined by priors, backed by theoretical analysis.

Result: The method demonstrates significant improvements in query efficiency over 11 state-of-the-art methods on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, as supported by theoretical derivations and empirical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances hard-label adversarial attack efficiency by incorporating transfer-based priors, outperforming existing methods in terms of query efficiency and providing strong theoretical backing for its improvements.

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Shuaifeng Zhi,Jiazhao Zhang,Zhoufeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RemixFusion, a method combining explicit and implicit representations for efficient and accurate large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural implicit representations enhance completeness and memory efficiency but struggle with detail capture and time consumption, limiting application to large-scale online reconstruction.

Method: The method proposes a mixed representation combining an explicit TSDF grid and a neural module to add fine details, enabling efficient detail-rich reconstruction. It extends a residual-based representation for multi-frame pose optimization, introduces a technique for gradient amplification, and employs a local moving volume for divide-and-conquer learning.

Result: Experiments show RemixFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mapping and tracking accuracy for large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: RemixFusion's approach addresses limitations of purely implicit or explicit methods, providing high-quality, scalable online reconstruction and camera tracking.

Abstract: The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.

TL;DR: InvRGB+L is a new inverse rendering model that uses both RGB and LiDAR data to reconstruct relightable, dynamic scenes with improved accuracy, overcoming challenges of traditional RGB-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional inverse rendering methods, which primarily use RGB data and minimally incorporate LiDAR information, struggle with accurate material estimation due to visible light interference. The authors aim to harness complementary LiDAR intensity cues for more robust material estimation and scene reconstruction.

Method: InvRGB+L introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR material consistency losses, which integrate LiDAR intensity data to enhance inverse rendering capabilities.

Result: The model generates novel-view RGB and LiDAR renderings of urban and indoor scenes, supporting tasks like relighting, night simulations, and dynamic object inserts. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scene-level urban inverse rendering and LiDAR simulation.

Conclusion: By effectively incorporating LiDAR intensity cues, InvRGB+L sets a new benchmark for inverse rendering models, enabling accurate, versatile, and higher-quality scene reconstructions for dynamic, relightable environments.

Abstract: We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR
material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR
renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night
simulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass
current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering
and LiDAR simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores the alignment between human visual attention and Vision Transformers, using eye-tracking and ViT attention maps. It finds some correlations but also emphasizes key differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to assess whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) can effectively mimic human visual attention mechanisms during aesthetic evaluations of handcrafted objects.

Method: Researchers recorded human gaze patterns on artisanal objects using eye-tracking and compared them with ViT-generated attention maps using Kullback-Leibler divergence. Statistical comparisons were performed to analyze levels of alignment.

Result: Optimal correlation between human and ViT attention occurred at specific Gaussian parameters, with attention head #12 aligning most closely with human patterns. However, significant differences across attention heads were observed.

Conclusion: ViTs show the potential for mimicking human visual attention in some contexts, but fundamental differences in attention strategies remain, with implications for applications in product design and aesthetics.

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

TL;DR: This paper presents a one-stage framework for predicting lane topology relationships in autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding lane topology relationships in autonomous driving are inefficient due to error propagation and high computational costs.

Method: The proposed method employs a one-stage architecture using transformer decoders to predict traffic elements, lane centerlines, and topology relationships without computationally expensive graph networks.

Result: Experiments on OpenLane-V2 show superior performance in lane detection, traffic element identification, and topology reasoning compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: This work advances lane topology understanding by improving accuracy and efficiency, particularly demonstrating effective model distillation with or without standard definition maps.

Abstract: Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

Result: ECHO-BID achieved state-of-the-art results in long-term re-identification, especially excelling under clothes-change and occluded environments. Effective dataset selection and protocol tuning further enhanced cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: Optimal backbone selection and transfer learning strategies substantially improve long-term person re-identification performance, particularly in challenging visual scenarios.

Abstract: Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct
pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can drive
substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

### [141] [CNS-Bench: Benchmarking Image Classifier Robustness Under Continuous Nuisance Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17651)
*Olaf Dünkel,Artur Jesslen,Jiahao Xie,Christian Theobalt,Christian Rupprecht,Adam Kortylewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNS-Bench, a benchmark designed for evaluating image classifiers' robustness in continuous, realistic out-of-distribution scenarios using generative nuisance shifts with a filtering mechanism for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to test out-of-distribution robustness in computer vision often rely on synthetic or binary shifts, which are insufficient for reflecting real-world nuisance changes. A more nuanced and continuous evaluation framework is needed.

Method: This benchmark uses LoRA adapters with diffusion models to generate continuous, realistic nuisance shifts and applies an improved filtering mechanism to ensure reliable image generation for classifier evaluation.

Result: CNS-Bench enables the assessment of 40+ image classifiers under varied nuisance shifts, uncovering how rankings and robustness change across shift severity levels and scales.

Conclusion: Continuous nuisance shift benchmarking provides deeper insights into model failure points and robustness changes, holding potential for improving real-world computer vision applications.

Abstract: An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper interprets the attention matrix in transformers as a discrete-time Markov chain, enabling advanced operations like indirect attention and defining metrics such as TokenRank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified interpretation of attention mechanisms in transformers, leveraging properties of Markov chains for new insights and applications.

Method: The authors model attention as a Markov chain and analyze its behavior mathematically through matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis.

Result: The paper achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation and introduces TokenRank for improved unconditional image generation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel perspective on token interactions in visual transformers, enhancing segmentation and generation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synergos-VQA enhances KBVQA through multi-faceted, synergistic reasoning by combining holistic, structural, and causal evidence streams for improved understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current MLLMs in KBVQA, which rely on uni-dimensional evidence, hindering robust, multi-faceted reasoning.

Method: The framework generates and merges three types of evidence during inference: holistic, structural, and causal evidence streams.

Result: Synergos-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, while enhancing various open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: A synergistic approach to evidence generation and integration can effectively improve reasoning and outperform reliance on large model scale alone.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

*Malsha Ashani Mahawatta Dona,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Yinan Yu,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) in their ability to handle complex traffic situations and proposes a hallucination detection strategy called BetterCheck to address issues where VLMs misinterpret objects in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) in automotive perception systems, particularly in understanding complex traffic scenarios while addressing their susceptibility to hallucinations.

Method: The authors systematically assessed the performance of three state-of-the-art VLMs on samples from the Waymo Open Dataset, focusing on their accuracy in identifying traffic agents and avoiding hallucinations.

Result: The study found that VLMs demonstrated remarkable image understanding capabilities and attention to fine details but remain prone to hallucinations, including adding or omitting objects in descriptions.

Conclusion: Vision-language models show promise in automotive systems but require improvements in hallucination detection to ensure safety and reliability, prompting the authors to propose their BetterCheck strategy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the growing use of facial filters in social media which negatively impact face recognition systems, by providing a scalable methodology to analyze their effects across diverse filters and cultures.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that includes a controlled dataset, a systematic filter selection process for diverse representation, and experimental evaluation to measure filters' impact on face recognition.

Result: The study demonstrates the framework through a case study involving filters from both American (Instagram and Snapchat) and Chinese (Meitu and Pitu) applications, revealing cross-cultural differences in filter effects.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that filter-induced distortions in face embedding space can be efficiently detected and corrected, enhancing face recognition performance despite the presence of filters.

Abstract: Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.

we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion

autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise
control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic
optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the

remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for 3D content generation suffer from computational inefficiencies due to quadratic attention complexity in their diffusion pipelines, making high-resolution, fine-grained modeling costly.

Method: Ultra3D employs a two-stage process: first, it uses a compact VecSet representation for efficient coarse object layout generation, and second, it introduces Part Attention, a localized attention mechanism, to refine latent features without unnecessary global computation.

Result: Ultra3D achieves up to a 6.7x speed-up in latent feature generation and supports high-resolution 3D modeling at a resolution of 1024, setting a new benchmark in both visual fidelity and user preference.

Conclusion: The proposed Ultra3D framework improves the efficiency of sparse voxel modeling significantly while maintaining or enhancing the quality of the generated 3D content, representing a substantial advancement in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mapple, a declarative programming interface for optimizing distributed applications with significant improvements in code modularity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing parallel programs for distributed heterogeneous systems, which often necessitates extensive code modifications.

Method: Implemented Mapple, a high-level interface with transformation primitives, including 'decompose', for mapping applications onto the Legion runtime framework.

Result: Mapple achieved 14X reduction in code size, up to 1.34X performance gains over expert-written mappers, and up to 1.83X improvement using its 'decompose' primitive.

Conclusion: Mapple simplifies development of high-performance mappers for distributed applications while improving performance and reducing complexity.

Abstract: Optimizing parallel programs for distributed heterogeneous systems remains a
complex task, often requiring significant code modifications. Task-based
programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from
core application logic, but their mapping interfaces are often too low-level.
In this work, we introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming
interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation
primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between iteration and processor
spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication
volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple
mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including
six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads,
Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14X and enables performance improvements of
up to 1.34X over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose
primitive achieves up to 1.83X improvement over existing
dimensionality-resolution heuristics. These results demonstrate that Mapple
simplifies the development of high-performance mappers for distributed
applications.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PathWeaver is a multi-GPU framework for faster and scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search, achieving up to 5.30x speedup over existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing dataset sizes demand efficient multi-GPU solutions for ANNS, as current methods lack scalability and utilize naive approaches.

Method: PathWeaver employs pipelining-based path extension for GPU communication, ghost staging for optimal query starting points, and direction-guided selection to filter irrelevant data early.

Result: The framework delivers 3.24x geomean speedup and up to 5.30x speedup on 95% recall rate compared to existing multi-GPU ANNS systems.

Conclusion: PathWeaver significantly advances multi-GPU ANNS by increasing scalability and reducing inefficiencies through novel techniques.

Abstract: Graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is widely adopted in
numerous applications, such as recommendation systems, natural language
processing, and computer vision. While recent works on GPU-based acceleration
have significantly advanced ANNS performance, the ever-growing scale of
datasets now demands efficient multi-GPU solutions. However, the design of
existing works overlooks multi-GPU scalability, resulting in naive approaches
that treat additional GPUs as a means to extend memory capacity for large
datasets. This inefficiency arises from partitioning the dataset and
independently searching for data points similar to the queries in each GPU. We
therefore propose PathWeaver, a novel multi-GPU framework designed to scale and
accelerate ANNS for large datasets. First, we propose pipelining-based path
extension, a GPU-aware pipelining mechanism that reduces prior work's redundant
search iterations by leveraging GPU-to-GPU communication. Second, we design
ghost staging that leverages a representative dataset to identify optimal query
starting points, reducing the search space for challenging queries. Finally, we
introduce direction-guided selection, a data selection technique that filters
irrelevant points early in the search process, minimizing unnecessary memory
accesses and distance computations. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse
datasets demonstrate that PathWeaver achieves 3.24$\times$ geomean speedup and
up to 5.30$\times$ speedup on 95% recall rate over state-of-the-art
multi-GPU-based ANNS frameworks.

TL;DR: BucketServe is a dynamic batching framework for optimizing LLM inference performance by minimizing memory overhead and ensuring better throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in GPU memory utilization and performance issues in current LLM serving systems under heterogeneous and dynamic workloads.

Method: The authors propose BucketServe, which groups and batches requests based on sequence length, dynamically adjusts bucket sizes, and uses priority-aware scheduling to meet service objectives while avoiding out-of-memory errors.

Result: BucketServe achieves up to 3.58x throughput improvement versus UELLM, handles 1.93x higher request loads compared to DistServe, and accommodates 1.975x more system load versus UELLM while maintaining SLO compliance.

Conclusion: BucketServe effectively improves throughput, system capacity, and resource utilization, offering a robust solution for serving LLMs in dynamic workload environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various
areas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to
LLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or
latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing
LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which
can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency,
especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to
adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and
potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce
BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM
inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based
on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU
memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory
(OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and
priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO
compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM
in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more
request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and
demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.

auto-scaling approach. This mainly involves several challenges such as
microservices dependency analysis, performance profiling, anomaly detection,
workload characterization and task co-location. Therefore, some advanced
algorithms have been investigated into auto-scaling cloud-native applications
to optimize system and application performance. These algorithms can learn from
historical data and appropriately adjust resource allocation based on the

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrownoutServe, a serving framework that enhances Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture efficiency, boosting throughput and reducing latency during dynamic traffic demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers efficient computation in large language models, current frameworks suffer from static model placement and inability to dynamically adapt, leading to inefficiencies and high latency under varying traffic conditions.

Method: The authors propose BrownoutServe, which utilizes 'united experts' to merge multiple expert knowledge, reduces access times, and incorporates a dynamic brownout mechanism to adjust workload processing adaptively. This mechanism ensures optimized resource utilization and adherence to service level objectives (SLOs).

Result: BrownoutServe improves throughput by up to 2.07x and reduces SLO violations by 90.28% compared to existing systems, while maintaining acceptable inference accuracy under different workloads.

Conclusion: BrownoutServe effectively enhances the efficiency and reliability of MoE-based LLMs, particularly during dynamic and bursty traffic conditions, by optimizing resource utilization and maintaining strong performance metrics.

Abstract: In recent years, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely
applied to large language models (LLMs), providing a promising solution that
activates only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, thereby
reducing overall memory requirements and allowing for faster inference compared
to dense models. Despite these advantages, existing systems still face issues
of low efficiency due to static model placement and lack of dynamic workloads
adaptation. This leads to suboptimal resource utilization and increased
latency, especially during bursty requests periods.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces BrownoutServe, a novel
serving framework designed to optimize inference efficiency and maintain
service reliability for MoE-based LLMs under dynamic computational demands and
traffic conditions. BrownoutServe introduces "united experts" that integrate
knowledge from multiple experts, reducing the times of expert access and
inference latency. Additionally, it proposes a dynamic brownout mechanism to
adaptively adjust the processing of certain tokens, optimizing inference
performance while guaranteeing service level objectives (SLOs) are met. Our
evaluations show the effectiveness of BrownoutServe under various workloads: it
achieves up to 2.07x throughput improvement compared to vLLM and reduces SLO
violations by 90.28%, showcasing its robustness under bursty traffic while
maintaining acceptable inference accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight pruning helps address computational inefficiencies in CNNs, where convolutional operators act as bottlenecks. The authors aim to improve memory and execution performance through advanced pruning strategies.

Method: The study employs a column-wise N:M pruning approach at tile level, modifies execution with XNNPACK tailored to RISC-V architecture, integrates operations like im2col and data packing, and uses profiling techniques to optimize convolution implementation.

Result: Their approach improved ResNet throughput by up to 4.0x while maintaining ImageNet top-1 accuracy within 2.1% of the dense baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully enhances inference throughput significantly without compromising much on model accuracy, showcasing practical efficacy in deep learning applications.

Abstract: In deep learning frameworks, weight pruning is a widely used technique for
improving computational efficiency by reducing the size of large models. This
is especially critical for convolutional operators, which often act as
performance bottlenecks in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the
effectiveness of pruning heavily depends on how it is implemented, as different
methods can significantly impact both computational performance and memory
footprint. In this work, we propose a column-wise N:M pruning strategy applied
at the tile level and modify XNNPACK to enable efficient execution of pruned
models on the RISC-V vector architecture. Additionally, we propose fusing the
operations of im2col and data packing to minimize redundant memory accesses and
memory overhead. To further optimize performance, we incorporate AITemplate's
profiling technique to identify the optimal implementation for each
convolutional operator. Our proposed approach effectively increases ResNet
inference throughput by as much as 4.0x, and preserves ImageNet top-1 accuracy
within 2.1\% of the dense baseline.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address workload balancing, communication, and cache-related data movement in scheduling computational tasks on processors.

Method: The authors use an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to create a holistic scheduling algorithm and evaluate it experimentally.

Result: The ILP-based algorithm delivers significantly better performance compared to traditional scheduling and memory management approaches.

Conclusion: Optimizing parallelization and memory management together yields superior solutions, as demonstrated by the proposed ILP-based algorithm in experimental benchmarks.

Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling a general computational DAG on multiple
processors in a 2-level memory hierarchy. This setting is a natural
generalization of several prominent models in the literature, and it
simultaneously captures workload balancing, communication, and data movement
due to cache size limitations. We first analyze the fundamental properties of
this problem from a theoretical perspective, such as its computational
complexity. We also prove that optimizing parallelization and memory management
separately, as done in many applications, can result in a solution that is a
linear factor away from the optimum.
  On the algorithmic side, we discuss a natural technique to represent and
solve the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We develop a holistic
scheduling algorithm based on this approach, and we experimentally study its
performance and properties on a small benchmark of computational tasks. Our
results confirm that the ILP-based method can indeed find considerably better
solutions than a baseline which combines classical scheduling algorithms and
memory management policies.

### [156] [Evaluating Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for the Standardization of Transtibial Prosthetic Socket Shape Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16818)
*C. H. E. Jordaan,M. van der Stelt,T. J. J. Maal,V. M. A. Stirler,R. Leijendekkers,T. Kachman,G. A. de Jong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study tested various AI approaches to predict transtibial prosthetic socket designs based on 3D limb scans, identifying that adaptation prediction via random forest models produced the most accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transtibial prosthetic socket fitting heavily relies on prosthetist expertise and lacks standardization, motivating exploration of AI tools to enhance and regularize the design process.

Method: Data from 118 patients, including 3D scans and corresponding socket models, underwent preprocessing for alignment and standardization. AI models (3D neural network, feedforward neural network, and random forest) were used to predict socket shapes or adaptation steps, with performance assessed via surface-to-surface error measurements and error location analysis.

Result: The random forest algorithm predicting adaptations achieved the best performance, with a median error of 1.24 mm, showcasing its ability to accurately replicate adjustments made by prosthetists.

Conclusion: AI can aid in standardizing prosthetic socket design, particularly by using adaptation-focused approaches, with random forest models achieving promising results.

Abstract: The quality of a transtibial prosthetic socket depends on the prosthetist's
skills and expertise, as the fitting is performed manually. This study
investigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help
standardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were
collected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data
consists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a
corresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data
pre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and
optionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.
Afterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural
network, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final
socket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the
socket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's
performance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the
AI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.
First, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface
error between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.
Second, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are
utilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the
required adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.
The random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest
error with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first
quartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.

### [157] [Exploring the Frontiers of kNN Noisy Feature Detection and Recovery for Self-Driving Labs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16833)
*Qiuyu Shi,Kangming Li,Yao Fehlis,Daniel Persaud,Robert Black,Jason Hattrick-Simpers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for detecting and correcting noisy features in self-driving laboratories (SDLs) to improve data quality using systematic detection and recovery methods influenced by noise levels and dataset sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-driving laboratories are hindered by noise in experimental data, which compromises their ability to model and discover new materials effectively.

Method: An automated workflow was developed for detecting noisy features, correcting sample-feature pairings, and recovering accurate feature values using systematic studies on variables such as dataset size, noise intensity, and feature distributions.

Result: High-intensity noise and large datasets improved detection and recovery. Low-intensity noise posed challenges but could be mitigated with larger clean datasets. Features with continuous or dispersed distributions showed better recoverability compared to narrow or discrete distributions.

Conclusion: This model-agnostic framework improves data recovery processes in SDLs, enhancing experimental precision and offering benchmarks for kNN imputation in materials data preparation.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery.

### [158] [Efficient Neural Network Verification via Order Leading Exploration of Branch-and-Bound Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17453)
*Guanqin Zhang,Kota Fukuda,Zhenya Zhang,H. M. N. Dilum Bandara,Shiping Chen,Jianjun Zhao,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Oliva, a verification framework that improves the efficiency of neural network verification by prioritizing sub-problems likely to contain counterexamples, achieving up to 80X speedup on CIFAR10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current branch-and-bound (BaB) verification methods inefficiently explore sub-problems in random order, delaying verification conclusions.

Method: Oliva introduces a priority-based approach to explore sub-problems. It proposes two strategies: $Oliva^{GR}$ (greedy prioritization of likely counterexamples) and $Oliva^{SA}$ (simulated-annealing inspired balance between exploration and exploitation).

Result: Oliva demonstrated up to 25X speedup on MNIST and up to 80X speedup on CIFAR10 compared to state-of-the-art verification methods.

Conclusion: Oliva's priority-based approach significantly enhances verification efficiency without degrading performance, making neural network verification more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has
necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the
quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is
a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to
sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the
sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these
sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from
an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this
gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,
concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.
Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that
explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more
likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of
the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it
only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead
to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including
$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that
are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy
inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to
exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally
evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5
models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up
to 80X in CIFAR10.

visual information with its textual interpretation. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates the usefulness of TD-Interpreter which outperformed untuned GPT-4o
by a large margin on the evaluated benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in conventional RL like credit assignment, high-dimensional state representations, and stability issues when tackling complex multi-step reasoning.

Method: A novel framework that integrates hyperbolic embeddings into Transformer-based RL models, leveraging these embeddings to model hierarchical structures.

Result: The proposed hyperbolic RL improves accuracy by 32%-44% on the FrontierMath benchmark and 43%-45% on the nonlinear optimal control benchmark, with computational time reductions of 16%-32% and 16%-17%, respectively.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic Transformers show significant promise in improving multi-step reasoning capabilities in RL, outperforming traditional Transformer-enabled RL approaches.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence,
with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making
in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in
enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term
rewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks
due to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state
representations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer
architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these
challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic
Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages
hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present
theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that
include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL
with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by
(32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by
(16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in
reinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that
involve hierarchical structures.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiffCarl, a new carbon- and risk-aware reinforcement learning approach for optimizing multi-microgrid operations with an emphasis on real-time energy scheduling under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing renewable energy adoption and system complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in achieving efficient, real-time energy optimization while managing uncertainty, carbon emissions, and operational risks.

Method: The proposed method, DiffCarl, integrates a diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning framework to enhance policy expressiveness. It employs a denoising generation process to enable adaptive, carbon-, and risk-aware energy scheduling in dynamic environments.

Result: Experimental results show DiffCarl achieves 2.3-30.1% lower operational costs, 28.7% lower carbon emissions compared to carbon-unaware variants, and reduces performance variability, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: DiffCarl is a viable, efficient, and adaptable solution for real-world multi-microgrid energy systems, thanks to its flexibility, lower carbon emissions, and reduced operational costs.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware
reinforcement learning algorithm for intelligent operation of multi-microgrid
systems. With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system
complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time
energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a
diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable
adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon
emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a
denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and
enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid
environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms
classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower
operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of
its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results
highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible
design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and
objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a geometrically interpretable framework for neural networks leveraging non-compact symmetric spaces.

Method: The paper details geometric properties of layers and interactions between layers to ensure covariance and interpretability using group-theoretic concepts.

Result: The groundwork for a group-theory-based geometric interpretation of neural networks is laid out, with theoretical and practical insights.

Conclusion: The research represents a foundational step towards neural networks designed for geometric and group-theoretic consistency.

Abstract: Recent work has identified non-compact symmetric spaces U/H as a promising
class of homogeneous manifolds to develop a geometrically consistent theory of

in a twin paper under the moniker of Cartan Neural Networks, showing both the
feasibility and the performance of these geometric concepts in a machine
learning context. The current paper expands on the mathematical structures
underpinning Cartan Neural Networks, detailing the geometric properties of the
layers and how the maps between layers interact with such structures to make
Cartan Neural Networks covariant and geometrically interpretable. Together,
these twin papers constitute a first step towards a fully geometrically
interpretable theory of neural networks exploiting group-theoretic structures

*Pengjiu Xia,Yidian Huang,Wenchao Wei,Yuwen Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new probabilistic encoding method to enhance classification tasks, improving generalization and representation learning for BERT and RoBERTa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian noise in probabilistic encoding can distort distance measurements in classification, reducing reliability and performance.

Method: The proposed method introduces a confidence-aware adjustment for distance calculations and replaces KL divergence variance regularization with L2 regularization to enhance encoding reliability.

Result: The method enhances model generalization and representation learning, achieving superior performance on natural language classification tasks for BERT and RoBERTa.

Conclusion: This model-agnostic approach significantly improves classification reliability and generalization, showcasing applicability across diverse neural network architectures.

Abstract: Probabilistic encoding introduces Gaussian noise into neural networks,
enabling a smooth transition from deterministic to uncertain states and
enhancing generalization ability. However, the randomness of Gaussian noise
distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE)
method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning.
Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First,
we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations,
ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification
tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance
regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2
regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is
model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification
tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and
generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SplitMeanFlow, a novel and efficient generative model framework based on an algebraic identity, outperforming current differential methods and achieving significant speedups in applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models like Flow Matching suffer from computational inefficiencies in their iterative sampling processes. Few-step or one-step generation approaches aim to address this but rely on limiting differential formulations.

Method: The authors propose "Interval Splitting Consistency," an algebraic identity based on definite integrals, avoiding differential operators. SplitMeanFlow enforces this identity directly as a learning objective for training average velocity fields.

Result: SplitMeanFlow recovers the differential identity used in previous methods as a limiting case and achieves practical efficiency without requiring JVP computations. It has been successfully applied to speech synthesis, including real-world products like Doubao, with up to 20x faster performance.

Conclusion: SplitMeanFlow represents a general, efficient, and practical framework for generative modeling, offering simpler implementation, improved training stability, and broad hardware compatibility compared to differential approaches.

Abstract: Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art
performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative
sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or
one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps
noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by
enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous
velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a
limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first
principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite
integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term
Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential
relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals
without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we
introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic
consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the
differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit
of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This
establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning
average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is
significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,
resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware
compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been
successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as
Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P3SL proposes a framework for Split Learning that balances computational efficiency, privacy, and local model personalization for heterogeneous edge systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing Split Learning frameworks regarding personalized privacy, local model customization, and resource heterogeneity for edge devices.

Method: Introduced a personalized sequential split learning pipeline paired with bi-level optimization to allow client-specific customization of privacy and model splits without exposing sensitive information.

Result: P3SL demonstrates improved energy efficiency, privacy protection, and model accuracy across diverse edge devices in the experimental testbed.

Conclusion: The framework effectively provides tailored yet secure split learning solutions for resource-constrained, heterogeneous edge devices.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning
technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in
model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side
sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it
encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices
vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental
conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored
heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying
resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and
local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split
Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device
systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a
personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to
achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models
tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and
privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers
clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without
sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,
environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach
balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high
model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7
devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop,
using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce latency, model size, and energy consumption for large language models without compromising accuracy, crucial for better user experience and lower costs.

Method: Quantization-aware training is utilized, requiring minimal model budget increase (<0.1%), and applies directly to model components without introducing new operations.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy compared to leading quantization methods on modern benchmarks, across various model architectures and variants.

Conclusion: The approach offers a simple, versatile, and efficient quantization technique, advancing state-of-the-art methods for large language models.

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency,
model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience
at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss
of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring
mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we
demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that,
with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms
the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern
benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily
generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to
activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional
operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-centric approach to reducing the environmental impact of Federated Learning (FL) by optimizing training data volume and node selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions from AI/ML adoption necessitate innovative solutions to mitigate their ecological footprint.

Method: The authors analyze federated datasets, select optimal data subsets using quality metrics, choose low-impact nodes, and introduce an interactive system to optimize FL configurations by reducing data.

Result: Applying the methodology to time series classification showed significant reductions in FL's environmental impact.

Conclusion: The proposed data-centric methodology offers a promising avenue for minimizing environmental costs in Federated Learning.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of
energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the
need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the
key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size
of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data
continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple
locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated
Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw
data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to
the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),
computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a
data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on
reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.
Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated
datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,
and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We
develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric
factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon
emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive
recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,
minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to
time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the
environmental impact of FL tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) for adaptive control of lower-limb exoskeletons, using predictive information to enhance terrain-specific functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance mobility and autonomy for individuals with motor impairments by improving decision-making in lower-limb exoskeletons across varied terrains.

Method: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) breaking down tasks into higher-level strategies and lower-level prediction via continual learning of General Value Functions (GVFs) from multiple sensors.

Result: Incorporating GVF-based predictions improved overall network accuracy and boosted performance in terrain-specific walking tasks like even/uneven ground, ramps, and turns.

Conclusion: Predictive information from GVFs aids decision-making under uncertainty, contributing to safer development of exoskeletons for diverse walking conditions.

Abstract: Rehabilitation technology is a natural setting to study the shared learning
and decision-making of human and machine agents. In this work, we explore the
use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control
strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy
for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of
biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down
the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level
framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for
providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the
continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal
abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors,
including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated
two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy
network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control
system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As
a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs
increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were
seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns,
terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This
suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during
uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified.
This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the
future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and

### [169] [Enhancing Quantum Federated Learning with Fisher Information-Based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17580)
*Amandeep Singh Bhatia,Sabre Kais*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) algorithm leveraging Fisher information to address challenges like heterogeneous client data and privacy in federated learning settings. Experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness against other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address key challenges in federated learning, such as communication costs, data heterogeneity, processing time, and privacy concerns, by incorporating quantum models and Fisher information for decentralized training.

Method: The authors proposed a QFL algorithm that utilizes Fisher information from local client models to identify critical parameters and preserve them during model aggregation.

Result: Experimental results using the ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrated improved performance and robustness compared to traditional quantum federated averaging methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging Fisher information in QFL improves model performance and robustness, providing a promising framework for federated quantum learning applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different
sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model
without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication
between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several
challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged
processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent
years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits
has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for
fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of
quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance
model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that
Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state
carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric
and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the
aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on
local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.
This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence
the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the
aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of
QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the
benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental
results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum
federated averaging method.

### [170] [Risk In Context: Benchmarking Privacy Leakage of Foundation Models in Synthetic Tabular Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17066)
*Jessup Byun,Xiaofeng Lin,Joshua Ward,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks foundation models and baselines for synthetic tabular data generation in low-data settings, revealing high privacy risks associated with certain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing synthetic tabular data generation is necessary for addressing privacy concerns and enhancing small or imbalanced datasets.

Method: The study compares three foundation models and four baselines across 35 datasets, evaluating fidelity, utility, and privacy risks. It also introduces tweaks to improve privacy without undermining fidelity.

Result: Foundation models exhibit higher privacy risks, with LLaMA 3.3 70B showing significantly elevated true-positive rates for sensitive data leaks compared to baselines. Prompting techniques reduce risks effectively.

Conclusion: Synthesizing tabular data via foundation models requires careful strategies to mitigate privacy risks while optimizing utility and fidelity, supported by the proposed benchmark and guidance.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows,
especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models
(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of
examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic
data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent
retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows
via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no
parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,
introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity
of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a
person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three
foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four
baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate
statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.
Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.
LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at
1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly
vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and
GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three
zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary
statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up
to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a
practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.

### [172] [Federated Majorize-Minimization: Beyond Parameter Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17534)
*Aymeric Dieuleveut,Gersende Fort,Mahmoud Hegazy,Hoi-To Wai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM) for stochastic optimization in federated learning, which is extended to form \QSMM for handling data heterogeneity, partial participation, and communication limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in federated learning such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints by developing a robust stochastic optimization approach based on MM problems.

Method: The authors explore MM problems with linearly parameterized surrogate functions and introduce \SSMM and \QSMM. Unlike traditional methods, \QSMM aggregates surrogate function information rather than original parameter data.

Result: The flexible methodology is demonstrated beyond theoretical constructs, including designing an algorithm for optimal transport maps in federated scenarios.

Conclusion: The developed algorithms unify various stochastic MM procedures and adapt them effectively to federated learning, showcasing theoretical rigor and practical adaptability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified approach for designing stochastic optimization
algorithms that robustly scale to the federated learning setting. Our work
studies a class of Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, which possesses a
linearly parameterized family of majorizing surrogate functions. This framework
encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth
objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as
variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying
algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM),
which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then
extend \SSMM\ to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common
bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and
communication constraints; this yields \QSMM. The originality of \QSMM\ is to
learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the
\textit{surrogate majorizing function}, contrary to classical algorithms which
learn and aggregate the \textit{original parameter}. Finally, to showcase the
flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to
design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated
setting.

### [173] [Should Bias Always be Eliminated? A Principled Framework to Use Data Bias for OOD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17001)
*Yan Li,Guangyi Chen,Yunlong Deng,Zijian Li,Zeyu Tang,Anpeng Wu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores when biased features should be retained and introduces a framework to strategically leverage them alongside invariant representations for better OOD domain model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the limitations of existing methods that focus solely on eliminating biased features, raising the question of when bias should be retained and utilized.

Method: The authors propose a two-pronged framework: (1) leveraging invariant representations to guide bias extraction for predictions, and (2) using identified bias to understand environmental conditions and selecting bias-aware predictors.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and standard domain generalization datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, proving its robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that retaining and strategically leveraging bias in conjunction with invariant representations is critical for improving robustness in OOD domain generalization models.

Abstract: Most existing methods for adapting models to out-of-distribution (OOD)
domains rely on invariant representation learning to eliminate the influence of
biased features. However, should bias always be eliminated -- and if not, when
should it be retained, and how can it be leveraged? To address these questions,
we first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under
which biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on
this theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically
leverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The
framework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and
indirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive
ingredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the
environmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware
predictors to alleviate environment gaps. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic datasets and standard domain generalization
benchmarks. Results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, underscoring its robustness and adaptability.

### [175] [Generalized Dual Discriminator GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17684)
*Penukonda Naga Chandana,Tejas Srivastava,Gowtham R. Kurri,V. Lalitha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new class of GANs, called generalized dual discriminator GANs, is introduced, combining tunable loss ($\alpha$-loss) and allowing for a broader framework, showing improved theoretical foundation and experimental performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks and enhance their flexibility and theoretical underpinnings.

Method: Introduces dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs) and generalizes them to functions on positive reals. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these models' optimization objectives reduce to linear combinations of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence.

Result: The new models theoretically generalize existing dual-GAN approaches (e.g., beyond KL-divergence to $f$-divergence) and demonstrate advantages via experiments on 2D synthetic data and various performance metrics.

Conclusion: These generalized models expand the applicability and robustness of GANs, improving both theoretical guarantees and experimental outcomes.

Abstract: Dual discriminator generative adversarial networks (D2 GANs) were introduced
to mitigate the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks. In
D2 GANs, two discriminators are employed alongside a generator: one
discriminator rewards high scores for samples from the true data distribution,
while the other favors samples from the generator. In this work, we first
introduce dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs), which combines
the strengths of dual discriminators with the flexibility of a tunable loss
function, $\alpha$-loss. We further generalize this approach to arbitrary
functions defined on positive reals, leading to a broader class of models we
refer to as generalized dual discriminator generative adversarial networks. For
each of these proposed models, we provide theoretical analysis and show that
the associated min-max optimization reduces to the minimization of a linear
combination of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence. This generalizes
the known simplification for D2-GANs, where the objective reduces to a linear
combination of the KL-divergence and the reverse KL-divergence. Finally, we
perform experiments on 2D synthetic data and use multiple performance metrics
to capture various advantages of our GANs.

Result: The proposed model effectively forecasts time series across four multivariate datasets, demonstrating improved interpretability and performance.

Conclusion: CGF-LLM introduces a novel approach to time series forecasting by leveraging LLMs with FTS and opens new research possibilities in this domain.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to time
series forecasting (TSF) has garnered significant attention among researchers.
This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with
fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series,
marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to
convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel
application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic
understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model.
The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the
complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results
confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting
model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets.
This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using
LLMs based on FTS.

### [177] [On the Interaction of Compressibility and Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17725)
*Melih Barsbey,Antônio H. Ribeiro,Umut Şimşekli,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between neural network compressibility and adversarial robustness, showing that certain compressions create vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between compressibility and adversarial robustness in neural networks remains a challenging and open area of study.

Method: The authors developed a framework to analyze the effects of neuron-level and spectral compressibility on adversarial robustness, deriving robustness bounds and conducting theoretical and empirical analyses.

Result: It was demonstrated that compression leads to vulnerabilities through a small number of sensitive directions in the representation space, which remain despite adversarial training and transfer learning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-offs between compressibility and robustness, suggesting new design strategies for models that aim to balance efficiency with security.

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

*Ray Zirui Zhang,Christopher E. Miles,Xiaohui Xie,John S. Lowengrub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an extension of BiLO (developed in Part 1) for Bayesian inference in PDE-constrained optimization, leveraging gradient-based MCMC and LoRA for efficient sampling, avoiding prior distribution specification on neural network solutions, and improving accuracy in parameter inference and uncertainty quantification while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient and accurate methods for uncertainty quantification and inverse problems in PDE-constrained optimization, particularly improving upon Bayesian neural network approaches.

Method: The proposed method trains a neural network at the lower level to approximate local solution operators and uses gradient-based MCMC with LoRA at the upper level for efficient parameter sampling under the Bayesian inference framework.

Result: The method demonstrates improved accuracy for parameter inference and uncertainty quantification by enforcing strong PDE constraints while offering computational efficiency. Errors in gradient dynamics and posterior distribution are analyzed to link solution tolerance to accuracy.

Conclusion: The introduced method successfully delivers accurate inference and uncertainty quantification across various PDE models and offers an efficient alternative to traditional Bayesian neural network approaches.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification and inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) are central to a wide range of scientific and
engineering applications. In this second part of a two part series, we extend
Bilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) for PDE-constrained optimization
problems developed in Part 1 to the Bayesian inference framework. At the lower
level, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by
minimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural
network. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior
distribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with
existing methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the
challenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights
and does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network
solution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the
PDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method
improves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty
quantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC
sampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact
minimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between
the tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the
resulting uncertainty quantification. Through numerical experiments across a
variety of PDE models, we demonstrate that our method delivers accurate
inference and quantification of uncertainties while maintaining high
computational efficiency.

*Melih Barsbey,Lucas Prieto,Stefanos Zafeiriou,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that higher learning rates in machine learning enhance robustness to spurious correlations, compressibility, and representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of achieving robustness to spurious correlations and resource efficiency in machine learning models simultaneously.

Method: The paper investigates how higher learning rates affect machine learning models, analyzing their impact on representation properties and comparing them with other hyperparameters and regularizations.

Result: Higher learning rates promote invariant feature utilization, class separation, activation sparsity, and robustness to spurious correlations across various datasets, models, and optimizers.

Conclusion: Using large learning rates offers a favorable pathway to combine robustness and network compressibility, suggesting their broader benefits even in standard classification tasks.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tree-based model to derive interpretable treatment policies from offline reinforcement learning (RL) data, ensuring reliable evaluation while maintaining closeness to observed behavior policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of interpretability and evaluation in offline RL for safety-critical domains, such as healthcare, where black-box models and off-policy evaluation pose risks.

Method: The authors use a tree-based model to analyze observational data and derive treatment policies by focusing on the most frequently chosen actions for each patient state. This design provides natural grouping and interpretability while controlling overlap with the behavior policy.

Result: Using datasets from rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, the approach demonstrated the ability to create interpretable treatment policies that outperform current practices and standard offline RL methods.

Conclusion: Tree-based models offer a practical and interpretable alternative for policy development in offline RL, addressing key challenges while improving clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal
policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability
and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains.
Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL
policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to
large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when
using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from
the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an
interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which
is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural
grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures
interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered
controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable
off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development
standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical
judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid
arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this
framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives
to those obtained via offline RL.

Motivation: To address the research gap in integrating multiple defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks in DRL models, particularly focusing on autonomous driving.

Method: The paper introduces an ensemble-based defense architecture combining multiple strategies to enhance DRL robustness against adversarial attacks.

Result: Under FGSM attacks, the proposed method improves mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (213% increase) and reduces mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (82% decrease) in tested scenarios.

Conclusion: The ensemble-based defense architecture outperforms standalone defense strategies in mitigating adversarial attacks, showcasing significant improvements in DRL robustness for autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated
its applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare,
energy optimization, and autonomous driving. However, a critical question
remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While
existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation
enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap
regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios
specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based
defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances
the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our
ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213%
increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82%
decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all
standalone defense strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses sensor drift in electronic nose systems for gas classification by introducing a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method DRCA by improving accuracy by 18% and F1-score by 15% on a UCI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor drift reduces the performance of electronic nose systems in real-world gas classification due to environmental changes and sensor aging. Existing methods showed potential but lacked robust statistical validation and often overcorrected, resulting in loss of class-related variance.

Method: The study designed two domain adaptation tasks simulating laboratory and online training settings using the UCI dataset. Three methods, including the proposed Knowledge Distillation (KD), Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid KD-DRCA, were systematically tested across 30 random test sets.

Result: The Knowledge Distillation (KD) method consistently outperformed DRCA and KD-DRCA in compensating sensor drift, achieving up to 18% higher accuracy and 15% higher F1-scores.

Conclusion: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is the first application for addressing electronic nose drift mitigation and significantly outperforms existing methods, offering improved reliability in real-world gas classification scenarios.

Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the
performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world
deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset
reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical
experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing
class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift
compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation
tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to
predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and
predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous
training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three
methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark
method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method
KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed
that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18%
improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior
effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for
electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift
compensation in real-world environments.

*Olivia Dry,Timothy L. Molloy,Wanxin Jin,Iman Shames*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZORMS-LfD is a novel approach to learn costs, constraints, and dynamics of constrained optimal control problems without requiring gradients, offering competitive or superior computation time and performance to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods for learning from demonstrations that require smoothness and gradient computation in optimal control problems, especially in continuous-time constrained settings, which have been largely overlooked.

Method: The paper introduces Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations (ZORMS-LfD), a gradient-free approach applicable to both continuous and discrete-time constrained optimal control problems.

Result: ZORMS-LfD reduces compute time by over 80% while matching first-order methods' performance on unconstrained continuous-time problems. It outperforms Nelder-Mead on constrained continuous-time problems, achieving better loss performance.

Conclusion: ZORMS-LfD is a promising, efficient alternative for solving constrained optimal control problems in continuous and discrete time, demonstrating better scalability and flexibility compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations
(ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of
constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to
be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the
learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order
methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs,
constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls
and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time,
with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention.
We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across
a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark
problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art
first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On
constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized

### [184] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tunes a Sparse Subnetwork in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17107)
*Andrii Balashov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) by modifying a small subset of parameters (5-30%), a phenomenon termed RL-induced parameter update sparsity. This sparsity occurs naturally across various algorithms and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the assumption that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters and to explore whether adapting a small subset suffices.

Method: The paper analyzes various RL algorithms and LLMs to identify sparsity patterns in parameter updates. It examines factors like KL penalties, gradient clipping, and distribution alignment.

Result: RL fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of parameters, with consistent sparsity across models, datasets, and algorithms. Fine-tuning this subnetwork replicates full model performance.

Conclusion: RL does not alter all parameters; it focuses on small, consistently updated subnetworks, offering insights for efficient RL techniques and connecting sparsity to the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large
language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is
often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's
parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL
fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of
weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced
parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity
constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,
Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show
substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far
exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the
pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers
full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully
fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL
operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted
changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited
effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts
models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,
consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods
and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Motivation: To provide an introduction to probabilistic graphical modeling, bridging probability and graph theory for better understanding and application in machine learning.

Method: The paper reviews basic probability and graph theory, followed by exploring three key themes: graph-based representation of distributions, parameter and structure learning, and inference methods.

Result: The tutorial consolidates foundational knowledge on probabilistic graphical modeling, highlighting core concepts and techniques for practical applications.

Conclusion: Probabilistic graphical models serve as powerful tools for reasoning under uncertainty, leveraging their theoretical and practical strengths to address decision-making and prediction tasks.

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine learning that uses
probability distributions to describe the world, make predictions, and support
decision-making under uncertainty. Underlying this modeling framework is an
elegant body of theory that bridges two mathematical traditions: probability
and graph theory. This framework provides compact yet expressive
representations of joint probability distributions, yielding powerful
generative models for probabilistic reasoning.
  This tutorial provides a concise introduction to the formalisms, methods, and
applications of this modeling framework. After a review of basic probability
and graph theory, we explore three dominant themes: (1) the representation of
multivariate distributions in the intuitive visual language of graphs, (2)
algorithms for learning model parameters and graphical structures from data,
and (3) algorithms for inference, both exact and approximate.

Abstract: The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, is crucial for
effective containment and treatment, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. This study presents an AI-driven diagnostic tool developed for
deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, leveraging the pre-trained
MobileNetV2 architecture for binary classification. The model was trained on

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and preventable types of cancer, yet
its early detection remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited
settings where access to specialized healthcare is scarce. This study proposes
an AI-driven diagnostic tool optimized for embedded systems to address this
gap. Using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture, the model was
adapted for binary classification of skin lesions into "Skin Cancer" and
"Other." The TensorRT framework was employed to compress and optimize the model
for deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, balancing performance with
energy efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted across multiple
benchmarks, including model size, inference speed, throughput, and power
consumption. The optimized models maintained their performance, achieving an
F1-Score of 87.18% with a precision of 93.18% and recall of 81.91%.
Post-compression results showed reductions in model size of up to 0.41, along
with improvements in inference speed and throughput, and a decrease in energy
consumption of up to 0.93 in INT8 precision. These findings validate the
feasibility of deploying high-performing, energy-efficient diagnostic tools on
resource-constrained edge devices. Beyond skin cancer detection, the
methodologies applied in this research have broader applications in other

*Yufei He,Ruoyu Li,Alex Chen,Yue Liu,Yulin Chen,Yuan Sui,Cheng Chen,Yi Zhu,Luca Luo,Frank Yang,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARIA, a framework built on LLMs to continuously learn and adapt domain knowledge during operation through self-dialogue, knowledge management, and human feedback. It demonstrates better adaptability and is operationally effective in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with adapting to environments where rules and domain knowledge frequently change. Current approaches like offline fine-tuning fail to address these challenges effectively during real-time applications.

Method: The authors propose ARIA, an adaptive LLM framework that uses structured self-dialogue to assess uncertainty, seeks targeted human feedback, updates an internal knowledge repository, and resolves outdated or conflicting domain knowledge to improve performance.

Result: ARIA demonstrated greater adaptability and accuracy than standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents, especially in tasks like customer name screening for TikTok Pay and other dynamic knowledge tasks.

Conclusion: ARIA showcases the potential of LLMs combined with interactive and reflective learning mechanisms for dynamic environments. Its successful deployment in TikTok Pay illustrates its real-world practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules
and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance
and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and
standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to
new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose
the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework
designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test
time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue,
proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or
corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal,
timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and
resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and
clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence
name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic
knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability
and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and
existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over
150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness
for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a method to accelerate generative models while maintaining high fidelity, achieving up to 1.8x speedups with minimal fidelity loss on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiencies of diffusion models while preserving their high-quality output, aiming to overcome fidelity issues seen in prior acceleration strategies.

Method: SADA combines adaptive sparsity allocation for trajectories and principled ODE approximation schemes using gradient information to accelerate sampling processes while maintaining fidelity.

Result: SADA achieves consistent speedups (≥1.8x) with minor fidelity degradation across various frameworks like SD-2, SDXL, ControlNet, and MusicLDM, significantly outperforming existing strategies.

Conclusion: SADA effectively balances computational efficiency and output fidelity, presenting a scalable acceleration strategy adaptable to diverse generative pipelines and modalities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Anant Khandelwal,Mucong Ding,Radu Balan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PICore is an unsupervised framework to efficiently select training samples for neural operators solving PDEs, reducing training data and computation costs without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the challenges of high computational costs and the large amount of labeled training data required to train neural operators for solving PDEs.

Method: PICore employs physics-informed loss functions to select the most relevant unlabeled training samples, reducing the need for extensive simulations to label data.

Result: PICore showed up to 78% improvement in training efficiency across multiple PDE benchmarks and maintained accuracy similar to supervised methods.

Conclusion: PICore enables more efficient training of neural operators by focusing on selecting informative samples, reducing labeling and simulation costs while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings
between function spaces. However, there are two main bottlenecks in training
neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We

*Vinura Galwaduge,Jagath Samarabandu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework for creating actionable and efficient explanations for network intrusion detection systems. It evaluates its effectiveness against existing methods using three datasets and demonstrates its capability to generate global rules for enhanced intrusion defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based network intrusion detection systems lack transparency, making it difficult to understand, trust, and counteract the decisions effectively. Current explainable AI methods often fail to translate insights into actionable countermeasures, creating a gap in applicability.

Method: The authors introduce a diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework designed to generate minimal and diverse counterfactuals efficiently. The method is benchmarked against other publicly available algorithms on three modern network intrusion datasets.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed other counterfactual explanation algorithms in generating diverse and minimal explanations more efficiently. It also provides a practical approach to summarizing these explanations into global rules used to filter out attack queries effectively.

Conclusion: The framework not only enhances explainability in network intrusion detection but also bridges the gap between instance-level and global-level actionable insights, improving both the trust and operational utility of such detection systems.

Abstract: Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the
predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box"
nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders
the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and
prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI)
methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the
causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide
explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable
countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based
counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations
for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against
several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3
modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also
presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation
algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our
proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the
tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by
reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how
counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing
them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at
instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global
counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack
queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in weather predictions by introducing an implicit two-stage training method and self-attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of weather prediction, addressing limitations of deep learning methods such as representation inconsistency in multivariable integration and struggles in capturing inter-variable dependencies in weather systems.

Method: The authors propose a novel implicit two-stage training method: stage one trains encoders and decoders to learn a shared latent space while freezing the Translator; stage two freezes encoders and decoders while the Translator captures inter-variable interactions. Additionally, they integrate a self-attention mechanism for better multivariable fusion.

Result: Their approach achieves significant improvements, reducing the mean squared error (MSE) for predictions of near-surface air temperature and relative humidity by 28.82% and 23.39%, respectively, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This study offers an effective, multimodal deep learning framework for weather predictions, showcasing superior performance and addressing key challenges in the field. The authors also make their implementation publicly available, facilitating future research.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate
change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been
made by the \textbf{end-to-end methods}, thanks to deep learning techniques,
but they face limitations of \textit{representation inconsistency} in
multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency
between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating
different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \textbf{two-stage
training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue,
but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the
results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an
implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders
for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen
while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second
stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures
inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a
self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the
performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments
show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces
the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by
28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology for transforming generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into efficient classifiers for video content moderation, addressing both computational and data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance video content moderation, which traditional models struggle to handle in complex scenarios like implicit harmful content and contextual ambiguity. MLLMs are promising but face industrial adoption barriers such as high computational costs and a lack of techniques for adapting generative models for classification.

Method: The authors introduce a method to transform generative MLLMs into multimodal classifiers with minimal training data. Additionally, they propose a router-ranking cascade system integrating MLLMs with a lightweight router model to reduce computational demands.

Result: Offline experiments show a 66.50% F1 score improvement over traditional classifiers using only 2% fine-tuning data. Online evaluations highlight a 41% increase in moderated content with computational costs reduced to 1.5% via cascading deployment.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable and efficient approach to leveraging MLLMs for industrial-level video content moderation, resolving challenges in computation and classification adaptability.

Abstract: Effective content moderation is essential for video platforms to safeguard
user experience and uphold community standards. While traditional video
classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they
struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and
contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a
promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal
reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder
their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes
full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for
discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,
we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a
multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable
industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that
integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over
traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online
evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume
by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5%
of direct full-scale deployment.

*Youneng Bao,Yiping Liu,Zhuo Chen,Yongsheng Liang,Mu Li,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a joint rate-utility optimization approach for dataset distillation, achieving significantly higher compression with comparable accuracy in machine learning datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern machine learning demands large datasets and models, leading to substantial computational and storage challenges. Dataset distillation, which compresses datasets into smaller, synthetic samples, needs optimization for both storage efficiency and model performance.

Method: The proposed method parameterizes synthetic samples as latent codes decoded by lightweight networks. It jointly optimizes Shannon entropy (rate measure) and distillation loss (utility measure) using a Lagrange multiplier. Additionally, it introduces the bits per class (bpc) metric for fair, storage-precise comparisons.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 170x greater compression than standard techniques like distillation while maintaining comparable accuracy across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128 datasets.

Conclusion: The joint optimization of rate and utility leads to superior storage-performance trade-offs, making the approach effective for diverse machine learning scenarios and architectures.

Abstract: Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DistrAttention, a faster and flexible self-attention mechanism for Transformers, addressing scalability issues by leveraging data grouping and locality-sensitive hashing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability limitations of Transformers caused by the quadratic time complexity of self-attention, while retaining flexibility and full-contextual information.

Method: The proposed DistrAttention groups data along the embedding dimensionality using lightweight sampling and locality-sensitive hashing techniques, complemented by a block-wise grouping framework. It is further optimized for integration with FlashAttention-2 on GPUs.

Result: DistrAttention demonstrated 37% faster performance than FlashAttention-2 for self-attention computations, showcased competitive speed and accuracy in ViT inference, and reduced inference time with minor accuracy loss in Llama3-1B.

Conclusion: DistrAttention is an efficient, accurate, and scalable self-attention mechanism, outperforming existing methods in both inference speed and overall flexibility across various settings.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the
state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing,
computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component,
self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence
length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches
on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack
of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and
flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention
achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually
referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and
fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A
block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors
introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block
sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining
high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive
experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than
FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,
DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate
self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the
lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.

TL;DR: This paper examines the generative potential of Autoencoders, establishes a connection between VAEs and VQ-VAEs through a new training method, and explores its limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the generative capabilities of Autoencoders and clarify the relationships between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, addressing limitations in the encoding spaces and exploring improved training methods.

Method: The authors propose a new VAE-like training framework that uses clustering centers instead of traditional KL divergence or reparameterization techniques. This method aims to create compact and well-defined latent spaces while allowing interpolation and perturbation within these spaces.

Result: Experimental validation, conducted on MNIST, CelebA, and FashionMNIST datasets, shows smooth latent space interpolation. However, issues like blurriness and semantic degeneration arise, especially when scaling to multiple vectors.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of compact and dispersed encoding spaces for generative modeling. It also provides a deeper understanding of the intrinsic relationships between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, elucidating both their potentials and limitations.

Abstract: This paper explores the generative capabilities of Autoencoders (AEs) and
establishes connections between Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Vector
Quantized-Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) through a reformulated training
framework. We demonstrate that AEs exhibit generative potential via latent
space interpolation and perturbation, albeit limited by undefined regions in
the encoding space. To address this, we propose a new VAE-like training method
that introduces clustering centers to enhance data compactness and ensure
well-defined latent spaces without relying on traditional KL divergence or
reparameterization techniques. Experimental results on MNIST, CelebA, and
FashionMNIST datasets show smooth interpolative transitions, though blurriness
persists. Extending this approach to multiple learnable vectors, we observe a
natural progression toward a VQ-VAE-like model in continuous space. However,
when the encoder outputs multiple vectors, the model degenerates into a
discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which combines image fragments without learning
semantic representations. Our findings highlight the critical role of encoding
space compactness and dispersion in generative modeling and provide insights
into the intrinsic connections between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, offering a new
perspective on their design and limitations.

Abstract: Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations
(DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a
critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or
specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event
Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES
data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation
events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating
interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries
for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.
This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational
issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck
identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities,
outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves
near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex
investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to
uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling
and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights,
reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency
evaluation and diagnosis.

### [198] [Decentralized Federated Learning of Probabilistic Generative Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17285)
*Aritz Pérez,Carlos Echegoyen,Guzmán Santafé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized federated learning framework for collaboratively learning probabilistic generative classifiers by sharing local statistics and updates among neighboring nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges of decentralized federated learning, particularly in enabling collaborative learning without a central server, accommodating non-i.i.d. data distributions, and ensuring data privacy.

Method: The proposed approach uses a communication network with local nodes that share local statistics with their neighbors. Each node aggregates information from neighbors, applies a local updating rule, and iteratively learns its classifier toward convergence to a global model.

Result: Experiments verify that the algorithm consistently achieves competitive global models across varied network topologies, sizes, data distributions, and local dataset conditions.

Conclusion: The framework enables decentralized collaboration for probabilistic generative classification, proving its robustness and adaptability in diverse settings while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of increasing relevance in real world
applications, aimed at building a global model across a network of
heterogeneous users without requiring the sharing of private data. We focus on
model learning over decentralized architectures, where users collaborate
directly to update the global model without relying on a central server. In
this context, the current paper proposes a novel approach to collaboratively
learn probabilistic generative classifiers with a parametric form. The
framework is composed by a communication network over a set of local nodes,
each of one having its own local data, and a local updating rule. The proposal
involves sharing local statistics with neighboring nodes, where each node
aggregates the neighbors' information and iteratively learns its own local
classifier, which progressively converges to a global model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally
competitive model across a wide range of network topologies, network sizes,
local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

*Zhuokun Chen,Zeren Chen,Jiahao He,Mingkui Tan,Jianfei Cai,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Stitch, a novel hybrid decoding framework designed to accelerate Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning by switching dynamically between small and large language models based on token-level confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiency of CoT reasoning in large language models, which is caused by their reliance on autoregressive decoding of long token sequences, while existing acceleration methods have inherent limitations.

Method: The proposed method, R-Stitch, leverages a token-level, confidence-based approach to dynamically switch between a Small Language Model (SLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM). The SLM generates tokens by default, delegating to the LLM only when the confidence threshold is not met, avoiding inefficiencies like full-sequence rollback.

Result: Empirical evaluations on math reasoning benchmarks show that R-Stitch reduces inference latency by up to 85% with negligible impact on accuracy, demonstrating significant acceleration of CoT reasoning.

Conclusion: R-Stitch offers a practical, training-free, and model-agnostic solution to improve the computational efficiency of CoT reasoning, maintaining high answer quality while drastically reducing latency.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

*Yan Zeng,Shenglan Nie,Feng Xie,Libo Huang,Peng Wu,Zhi Geng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses imitation learning issues caused by unmeasured confounders, proposing a model using instrumental variables (IV) to mitigate biases and improve policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning often faces biases from unmeasured confounders affecting states and actions, leading to inaccurate policy estimation.

Method: Introduces a Confounded Causal Imitation Learning (C2L) model with a two-stage framework: (1) Identifies valid instrumental variables using a testing criterion based on pseudo-variables. (2) Optimizes policies either via a simulator or offline approach.

Result: Effectively identifies valid instrumental variables and improves policy learning, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: C2L successfully mitigates the effects of unmeasured confounders, offering more reliable and bias-free imitation learning policies.

Abstract: Imitation learning from demonstrations usually suffers from the confounding
effects of unmeasured variables (i.e., unmeasured confounders) on the states
and actions. If ignoring them, a biased estimation of the policy would be
entailed. To break up this confounding gap, in this paper, we take the best of
the strong power of instrumental variables (IV) and propose a Confounded Causal
Imitation Learning (C2L) model. This model accommodates confounders that
influence actions across multiple timesteps, rather than being restricted to
immediate temporal dependencies. We develop a two-stage imitation learning
framework for valid IV identification and policy optimization. In particular,
in the first stage, we construct a testing criterion based on the defined
pseudo-variable, with which we achieve identifying a valid IV for the C2L
models. Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability
conditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we
propose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator,
while the other is offline. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of
identifying the valid IV as well as learning the policy.

Conclusion: EarthLink represents a transformative development for Earth system research, fostering a shift from manual work to strategic oversight, and enabling a more collaborative, transparent, and effective scientific approach.

Abstract: Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and
complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated
analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific
discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an
interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research
workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike
static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction,
continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We
validated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate
change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex
phenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically
sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as
comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow.
Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language
interface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to
strategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step
towards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth system
research in an era of accelerating global change.

### [202] [A Learning-based Domain Decomposition Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17328)
*Rui Wu,Nikola Kovachki,Burigede Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel learning-based domain decomposition method (L-DDM) using neural operators to efficiently solve large and complex geometries in PDEs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of established numerical methods like the Finite Element Method in handling large-scale and complex geometric problems, as well as improving the scalability and application of neural network-based methods to real-world PDEs.

Method: The authors introduced an L-DDM that integrates a pre-trained neural operator as a surrogate model within a domain decomposition framework to solve large and complex domains efficiently.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated accurate solutions for elliptic PDEs with discontinuous microstructures in complex geometries, achieving resolution invariance and generalizing well to unseen microstructural patterns during training.

Conclusion: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for challenging PDE problems and proves both computationally efficient and robust for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have
driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at
much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical
methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle
with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and
geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods
have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate
nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely
limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs
involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain
decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a
single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a
surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle
large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical
result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of
domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method
by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous
microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural
operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers
resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns
unseen during training.

*Xianbiao Qi,Marco Chen,Wenjie Xiao,Jiaquan Ye,Yelin He,Chun-Guang Li,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), a modified Transformer architecture designed to work efficiently with simpler optimizers like momentum SGDW (mSGDW), achieving performance comparable to AdamW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers often require advanced adaptive optimizers like AdamW for training due to their gradient heavy-tailed distributions. This dependency motivates the need for a model that works effectively with simpler optimizers, such as mSGDW.

Method: The authors integrate normalization techniques strategically within the Transformer architecture (DNT) to stabilize gradient distributions and balance weights, activations, and their interactions. The adjustments also influence layer Jacobians.

Result: The Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT) performs better than standard Transformer models like ViT and GPT. Additionally, it is successfully trained using the simpler mSGDW optimizer, achieving comparable results to AdamW-trained models.

Conclusion: DNT addresses the gradient-related limitations in standard Transformers, enabling efficient training with mSGDW. It demonstrates strong theoretical and empirical results, offering a simpler alternative to AdamW without compromising performance.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.

*Rongwei Lu,Jingyan Jiang,Chunyang Li,Haotian Dong,Xingguang Wei,Delin Cai,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distributed SGD, a key parallel optimizer for challenging networks, suffers from significant throughput reduction due to latency and bandwidth issues. This paper introduces DeCo-SGD, which dynamically balances compression and staleness for optimal convergence and achieves up to 5.07x speed-ups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of distributed machine learning in high-latency and low-bandwidth network environments, where traditional methods like Distributed SGD experience severe performance degradation.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze the interplay between compression ratio, staleness, and convergence rate. Using this, they propose DeCo-SGD, which adaptively adjusts parameters in response to real-time network and training conditions.

Result: DeCo-SGD demonstrates considerable improvements, achieving speed-ups of up to 5.07x compared to Distributed SGD and 1.37x over methods with static strategies in challenging network environments.

Conclusion: The study establishes theoretical insights into how compression and delay impact training. DeCo-SGD proves effective in dynamically optimizing distributed training, making it highly suitable for variable network conditions.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning in high end-to-end latency and low, varying
bandwidth network environments undergoes severe throughput degradation. Due to
its low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the
mainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from
significant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing
approaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to
alleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both
challenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a
complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed
synchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance
under varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to
dynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on
static heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which
prevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical
gap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization
problem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable
noise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies
the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a
critical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect
training. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware
time minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the
compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and
training task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and
static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,
respectively.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of datasets for ordinal classification (OC) problems by introducing TOC-UCO, a public repository containing 46 preprocessed tabular ordinal datasets with guidelines for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge in OC research—the scarcity of comprehensive, well-prepared datasets for robust validation and benchmarking of novel approaches.

Method: Developed TOC-UCO, a repository of 46 ordinal datasets with consistent preprocessing, reasonable patterns, proper class distributions, and standardized train-test partition indices.

Result: TOC-UCO repository provides researchers access to preprocessed datasets, sources, preprocessing details, and train-test partitions to bolster reproducibility and benchmarking in ordinal classification research.

Conclusion: The TOC-UCO repository addresses the significant barrier of data scarcity in OC research, fostering more robust experimental validation of methodologies and advancing the field.

Abstract: An ordinal classification (OC) problem corresponds to a special type of
classification characterised by the presence of a natural order relationship
among the classes. This type of problem can be found in a number of real-world
applications, motivating the design and development of many ordinal
methodologies over the last years. However, it is important to highlight that
the development of the OC field suffers from one main disadvantage: the lack of
a comprehensive set of datasets on which novel approaches to the literature
have to be benchmarked. In order to approach this objective, this manuscript
from the University of C\'ordoba (UCO), which have previous experience on the
OC field, provides the literature with a publicly available repository of
tabular data for a robust validation of novel OC approaches, namely TOC-UCO
(Tabular Ordinal Classification repository of the UCO). Specifically, this
repository includes a set of $46$ tabular ordinal datasets, preprocessed under
a common framework and ensured to have a reasonable number of patterns and an
appropriate class distribution. We also provide the sources and preprocessing
steps of each dataset, along with details on how to benchmark a novel approach
using the TOC-UCO repository. For this, indices for $30$ different randomised
train-test partitions are provided to facilitate the reproducibility of the
experiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DynaSearcher—an innovative search agent that uses dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL) to improve search accuracy, efficiency, and factual consistency in complex information retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in current multi-step retrieval systems, such as generating factually inconsistent queries and inefficiencies during search, leading to reasoning deviations and redundancies.

Method: DynaSearcher incorporates dynamic knowledge graphs to model entity relationships explicitly, ensuring factual consistency, and employs a multi-reward RL framework to balance training objectives of retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality.

Result: DynaSearcher achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on six multi-hop question-answering datasets, performing comparably to advanced LLMs while relying on smaller models and fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization, robustness, and broad applicability across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, positioning DynaSearcher as highly effective in multi-step information search tasks.

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks.
However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical
applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate
queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning
deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose
DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs
and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system
leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search
process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual
consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for
fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy,
efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of
high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while
discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or
redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets,
matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited
computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and
larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViRN, a novel continual learning framework designed for handling long-tailed data distributions using variational inference and distributional trilateration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI systems often face challenges in adapting to new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned classes in the presence of long-tailed data distributions and class imbalance.

Method: ViRN leverages Variational Autoencoder to model class-conditional distributions and uses Wasserstein distance-based retrieval and geometric fusion for reconstructing tail-class representations.

Result: ViRN demonstrates a 10.24% average accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods on six long-tailed classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViRN effectively addresses stability and plasticity issues in continual learning, making it suitable for tasks involving long-tailed distributions, such as speech and image classification.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with long-tailed data distributions remains a
critical challenge for real-world AI systems, where models must sequentially
adapt to new classes while retaining knowledge of old ones, despite severe
class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to balance stability and plasticity,
often collapsing under extreme sample scarcity. To address this, we propose
ViRN, a novel CL framework that integrates variational inference (VI) with
distributional trilateration for robust long-tailed learning. First, we model
class-conditional distributions via a Variational Autoencoder to mitigate bias
toward head classes. Second, we reconstruct tail-class distributions via
Wasserstein distance-based neighborhood retrieval and geometric fusion,
enabling sample-efficient alignment of tail-class representations. Evaluated on
six long-tailed classification benchmarks, including speech (e.g., rare
acoustic events, accents) and image tasks, ViRN achieves a 10.24% average
accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

*Shahil Shaik,Jonathon M. Smereka,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Distributional Generalized Advantage Estimation (DGAE), extending traditional GAE with a Wasserstein-like metric for distributional reinforcement learning, and showed its effectiveness in policy gradient algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) is not designed to handle value distributions in distributional reinforcement learning, which are better suited for capturing system stochasticity and reducing noise sensitivity.

Method: The authors propose DGAE, which uses a Wasserstein-like directional metric derived from optimal transport theory combined with exponentially weighted estimation, providing low-variance advantage estimation.

Result: The proposed DGAE was integrated into three policy gradient methods and was tested across multiple OpenAI Gym environments, where it demonstrated improved performance compared to traditional GAE.

Conclusion: DGAE offers a more robust and low-variance alternative for advantage estimation in policy gradient methods, enhancing performance in distributional reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) has been used to mitigate the
computational complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) by employing an
exponentially weighted estimation of the advantage function to reduce the
variance in policy gradient estimates. Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not
designed to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can
capture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to
system noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes
the optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional
metric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies
between probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation,
we leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional
GAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a
low-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for
policy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy
updates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods.
Algorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared
with the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called 'Rubrics as Rewards' (RaR) that uses structured rubrics as interpretable reward signals for reinforcement learning, improving performance on real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of defining reliable reward signals for reinforcement learning in tasks lacking unambiguous ground truth, overcoming the limitations of opaque and error-prone preference-based reward methods.

Method: The RaR framework employs structured checklist-style rubrics as interpretable rewards, applied in conjunction with GRPO for on-policy training.

Result: RaR achieves a 28% relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to Likert-based approaches and matches or surpasses expert-written reference-derived rewards.

Conclusion: Rubric-based rewards improve alignment with human preferences and ensure dependable performance across model scales, offering a transparent alternative to traditional reward methods.

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world
tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria.
However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it
difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models.
While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on
opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious
correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework
that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals
for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$
relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based
approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals
derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured
reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better
align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model
scales.

TL;DR: The paper addresses continual generalized category discovery (C-GCD) and introduces Variational Bayes C-GCD (VB-CGCD), which significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves class alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in C-GCD, especially when new and old class data mix in unlabeled streams.

Method: The proposed VB-CGCD framework integrates variational inference with covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification and suppresses pseudo-label noise through stochastic variational updates.

Result: VB-CGCD achieves a +15.21% accuracy improvement on standard benchmarks and a 67.86% accuracy on a challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.

Conclusion: VB-CGCD offers a robust solution for C-GCD, significantly mitigating forgetting and improving performance across varied scenarios.

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge:
incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving
knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We
address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens,
revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives
performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes
C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with
covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns
class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic
variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21%
with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also
introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended
online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher
than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across
diverse scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/daihao42/VB-CGCD

### [211] [A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17417)
*Yutong Liu,Cairong Zhao,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for large language models (LLMs), providing fair comparisons, a theoretical framework for these techniques, and an evaluation of the latest MXFP4 format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require significant computational resources and memory, and PTQ offers a potential solution to reduce these overheads. Existing PTQ methods are varied and lack a unified theoretical understanding or fair experimental benchmarking.

Method: The authors review published PTQ techniques, decouple them into pre-quantization transformation (reducing outlier impact) and quantization error mitigation (addressing errors from quantization), and evaluate their components on a consistent experimental framework. They also analyze the MXFP4 data format.

Result: Optimized rotation and scaling are most effective for pre-quantization transformation. Combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms GPTQ alone in quantization error mitigation. INT4 and MXFP4 require different optimization strategies.

Conclusion: The study establishes a fair and theoretical foundation for PTQ methods, identifies effective optimization strategies, and highlights areas for further investigation, particularly around MXFP4.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can
significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model
quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have
reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same
ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In
addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is
crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an
extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive
evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge,
this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet
underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple
the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization
transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a
preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of
outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for
quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the
errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We
evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization
methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and
its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation
and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and
combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ
alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential
of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization
transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring
further investigation.

Conclusion: The study suggests that the geometry of persistence diagrams can effectively characterize gaze dynamics and offers a promising avenue for affective computing and human behavior analysis.

Abstract: We present a topological pipeline for automated multiclass emotion

*Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces C3RL, a novel framework to improve multivariate time series forecasting by combining channel-mixing (CM) and channel-independence (CI) strategies, enhancing performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting approaches either fail to capture variable-specific temporal patterns (CM strategy) or cross-variable dependencies (CI strategy), resulting in limited generalization and interpretability.

Method: C3RL employs a siamese network architecture inspired by contrastive learning, treating CM and CI inputs as transposed views. It jointly optimizes contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting.

Result: C3RL achieves best-case performance rates of 81.4% for CI-based models and 76.3% for CM-based models across extensive experiments on seven forecasting models.

Conclusion: C3RL enhances multivariate time series forecasting by effectively balancing representation learning and prediction performance, while addressing shortcomings of CM and CI strategies.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to
its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either
channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can
capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific
temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit
cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion
offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we
propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models
both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer
vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and
builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone,
while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and
prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and
forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL
boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy
and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong
generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is
accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cognitive biases and enhance fairness and long-term outcomes in critical decision-making scenarios like university admissions.

Method: Developed BGM-HAN, a model integrating hierarchical learning with enhancements to reduce biases and improve interpretability and predictive performance.

Result: The model outperformed existing methods, including traditional machine learning and large language models, on real admissions data.

Conclusion: BGM-HAN offers a robust framework to augment decision-making in scenarios rife with complex, structured data while ensuring fairness and context.

Abstract: Human decision-making in high-stakes domains often relies on expertise and
heuristics, but is vulnerable to hard-to-detect cognitive biases that threaten
fairness and long-term outcomes. This work presents a novel approach to
enhancing complex decision-making workflows through the integration of
hierarchical learning alongside various enhancements. Focusing on university
admissions as a representative high-stakes domain, we propose BGM-HAN, an
enhanced Byte-Pair Encoded, Gated Multi-head Hierarchical Attention Network,
designed to effectively model semi-structured applicant data. BGM-HAN captures
multi-level representations that are crucial for nuanced assessment, improving
both interpretability and predictive performance. Experimental results on real
admissions data demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms
both state-of-the-art baselines from traditional machine learning to large
language models, offering a promising framework for augmenting decision-making
in domains where structure, context, and fairness matter. Source code is

*Nazar Buzun,Daniil Shlenskii,Maxim Bobrin,Dmitry V. Dylov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection (HOTA), a scalable method for solving dynamical optimal transport problems without relying on explicit density modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current generative models, which rely on simplistic geometry and strong density-estimation assumptions, leading to suboptimal results in trajectories on complex manifolds.

Method: It proposes HOTA, which uses a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman framework leveraging Kantorovich potentials to explicitly tackle the dual dynamical optimal transport problem, avoiding explicit density estimation.

Result: HOTA demonstrated superior performance over baselines on standard benchmarks and custom datasets, even in cases involving non-differentiable cost functions.

Conclusion: The method effectively optimizes trajectories more feasibly and optimally, offering a robust and scalable approach to dynamical optimal transport challenges.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the
probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial
geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions,
yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in
the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection
(HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical
OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and
scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for
explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are
non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks,
as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of
feasibility and optimality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the matrix contextual bandit framework to incorporate graph information, developing a new method that improves decision-making policies in settings like online advertising and recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matrix contextual bandit methods fail to leverage graph information, limiting their ability to create effective policies in applications where user/item relationships can be modeled as graphs.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework based on the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. This framework integrates low-rank structure and graph information through solving a joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, combined with a graph-based generalized linear UCB algorithm.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superiority over popular alternatives in terms of cumulative regret bound. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets further validate the advantages of the approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating graph information into the matrix contextual bandit framework leads to better decision-making policies. This work shows theoretical and experimental evidence of its effectiveness, filling a gap in the existing literature.

Abstract: The matrix contextual bandit (CB), as an extension of the well-known
multi-armed bandit, is a powerful framework that has been widely applied in
sequential decision-making scenarios involving low-rank structure. In many
real-world scenarios, such as online advertising and recommender systems,
additional graph information often exists beyond the low-rank structure, that
is, the similar relationships among users/items can be naturally captured
through the connectivity among nodes in the corresponding graphs. However,
existing matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby
making them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill
in this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework
that builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new
framework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph
information in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a
joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the
implementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB
algorithm. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that our procedure
outperforms several popular alternatives in terms of cumulative regret bound,
owing to the effective utilization of graph information. A series of synthetic
and real-world data experiments are conducted to further illustrate the merits
of our procedure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble techniques like stacking improve predictive performance but often lack interpretability. The paper seeks to bridge this gap by creating an explainable stacking framework.

Method: The framework combines dynamic feature transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations, making stacked models both accurate and explainable.

Result: XStacking was tested on 29 datasets, showing improvements in predictive effectiveness and model interpretability.

Conclusion: XStacking effectively balances predictive accuracy with explainability, offering a scalable solution for responsible machine learning.

Abstract: Ensemble Machine Learning (EML) techniques, especially stacking, have been
shown to improve predictive performance by combining multiple base models.
However, they are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. In this
paper, we introduce XStacking, an effective and inherently explainable
framework that addresses this limitation by integrating dynamic feature
transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations. This enables
stacked models to retain their predictive accuracy while becoming inherently
explainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on 29 datasets,
achieving improvements in both the predictive effectiveness of the learning
space and the interpretability of the resulting models. XStacking offers a
practical and scalable solution for responsible ML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors compare various meta-learning methods for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, considering multiple aspects like performance, interpretability, and computational cost, and propose guidelines for creating highly effective learned RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning aims to improve machine learning systems by learning algorithms directly from data rather than manually designing them, especially for reinforcement learning (RL), where traditional methods often fall short.

Method: The study empirically evaluates multiple meta-learning approaches, including black-box function optimization through evolution and using LLMs for proposing code, on different parts of the RL pipeline.

Result: Comprehensive comparisons were conducted covering meta-train and meta-test performance, interpretability, sample cost, and training time of various meta-learning methods.

Conclusion: The findings lead to actionable guidelines for developing new RL algorithms through meta-learning, focusing on maximizing their performance and practicality.

Abstract: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on
manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the
performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise
for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from
supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.
However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different
meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box
functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical
comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned
algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to
meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the
interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.
Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL
algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as
performant as possible.

### [219] [Towards Effective Open-set Graph Class-incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17687)
*Jiazhen Chen,Zheng Ma,Sichao Fu,Mingbin Feng,Tony S. Wirjanto,Weihua Ou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses open-set challenges in graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) by proposing the OGCIL framework, focusing on catastrophic forgetting and robust detection of unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in existing GCIL methods, which wrongly assume all test samples belong to known classes, a scenario unrealistic for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed OGCIL framework utilizes a prototypical conditional variational autoencoder for pseudo-sample generation, combined with a mixing-based strategy for generating OOD samples, and introduces prototypical hypersphere classification loss for better separation and rejection of unknown classes.

Result: Experimental results on five benchmarks show that OGCIL effectively outperforms existing GCIL and open-set GNN methods, enhancing both knowledge retention and unknown class detection capabilities.

Conclusion: OGCIL provides a robust mechanism to tackle open-set scenarios in GCIL, ensuring effective learning and recognition even in evolving task environments.

Abstract: Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs)
to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class
knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods
primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed
to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge
during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a
more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two
intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs
the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which
destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,
a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding
generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust
detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional
variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old
classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle
unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node
embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further
proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class
prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all
unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly
models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a
robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN
methods.

### [220] [Joint Asymmetric Loss for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17692)
*Jialiang Wang,Xianming Liu,Xiong Zhou,Gangfeng Hu,Deming Zhai,Junjun Jiang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new asymmetric loss function called Asymmetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), integrated into an advanced optimization framework, Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL), to improve the robustness of learning with noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of symmetric losses, which often lead to underfitting. The authors seek to leverage the theoretical advantages of asymmetric losses and align them with advanced optimization frameworks like APL.

Method: The authors propose AMSE, a novel asymmetric loss, and derive conditions for its validity. By replacing the symmetric passive loss in APL with AMSE, they develop the Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL) framework.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that the JAL framework is effective in mitigating label noise compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The JAL framework demonstrates superior robustness to noisy labels, bridging the gap between theoretical advantages of asymmetric losses and their practical application in optimization frameworks like APL.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

*Taha Ceritli,Ondrej Bohdal,Mete Ozay,Jijoong Moon,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Hyeonmok Ko,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HydraOpt is a new merging technique for low-rank adapters in LLMs that reduces memory requirements while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of storing separate adapters for each task in LLMs, which increases memory demands in resource-constrained environments.

Method: HydraOpt exploits similarities between matrices in low-rank adapters, unlike other techniques producing fixed trade-offs between size and performance.

Result: HydraOpt achieves a 48% reduction in storage and limits performance drops to 0.2-1.8%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: HydraOpt offers a more balanced and efficient approach to adapter merging, making it suitable for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based
adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a
separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements,
posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile
devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they
typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we
introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the
inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike
existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and
performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and
performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage
size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving
competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing
merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse
storage efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces fractional-order dynamics to Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) through the proposed Fractional SPIKE Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), designed to improve memory and expressiveness in temporal computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the limitations of traditional Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that use simple Markovian dynamics, which fail to capture long-term dependencies observed in biological neurons with non-Markovian behavior.

Method: The proposed method, fspikeDE, incorporates fractional-order differential dynamics to SNNs. It employs an efficient gradient descent algorithm for training, leveraging adjoint sensitivity methods to solve fractional-order ODEs.

Result: fspikeDE exhibits consistent superiority over traditional SNNs across multiple benchmarks, showcasing better accuracy, energy efficiency, memory efficiency, and robustness against noise.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of integrating fractional-order dynamics into SNNs for more expressive temporal computation. It also introduces an open-source computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, enabling broad applicability.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to
create realistic models for brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness
in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological
realism. Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane
voltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
with Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time
depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network
expressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by
long-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting
non-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE
Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term
dependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order
dynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns
beyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of
fspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters
by solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using
adjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph
datasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs,
achieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training
memory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a
novel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely
applicable to various real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for statically verifying higher-order programs with assertions in the (C)LP paradigm by refining predicate properties and leveraging abstract interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static verification of higher-order assertions in (C)LP programs remains understudied despite the importance of higher-order constructs for code expressiveness and assertions for program correctness.

Method: The paper refines predicate properties in the assertion language and introduces an abstract criterion for compile-time verification, which reduces higher-order properties to first-order ones using an existing static analyzer.

Result: A prototype implementation is developed and tested within the Ciao system, demonstrating practical feasibility and effectiveness through various examples.

Conclusion: The approach provides a generalizable and systematic method for static verification of higher-order assertions, paving the way for improved correctness in higher-order (C)LP programs.

Abstract: Higher-order constructs enable more expressive and concise code by allowing
procedures to be parameterized by other procedures. Assertions allow expressing
partial program specifications, which can be verified either at compile time
(statically) or run time (dynamically). In higher-order programs, assertions
can also describe higher-order arguments. While in the context of (C)LP,
run-time verification of higher-order assertions has received some attention,
compile-time verification remains relatively unexplored. We propose a novel
approach for statically verifying higher-order (C)LP programs with higher-order
assertions. Although we use the Ciao assertion language for illustration, our
approach is quite general and we believe is applicable to similar contexts.
Higher-order arguments are described using predicate properties -- a special
kind of property which exploits the (Ciao) assertion language. We refine the
syntax and semantics of these properties and introduce an abstract criterion to
determine conformance to a predicate property at compile time, based on a
semantic order relation comparing the predicate property with the predicate
assertions. We then show how to handle these properties using an abstract
interpretation-based static analyzer for programs with first-order assertions
by reducing predicate properties to first-order properties. Finally, we report
on a prototype implementation and evaluate it through various examples within
the Ciao system.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for analyzing large-scale naturalistic driving study data to describe driving behaviors across metrics like speed, lane keeping, and headway, contextualized by demographics and roadway features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify normative driving behaviors for improving vehicle safety systems and intelligent transportation systems through insights derived from large-scale driving data.

Method: The methodology processes driving data from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) NDS using vehicle, GPS, and radar data. It also includes the development of interactive online tools for dynamic group comparisons.

Result: The paper identifies, for instance, that young female drivers on 65-mph roads speed more frequently than males and younger drivers generally maintain shorter headways.

Conclusion: The research aids in advancing transportation safety systems by providing a methodology to analyze driving behavior across various groups and datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to process large-scale naturalistic driving
studies (NDS) to describe the driving behavior for five vehicle metrics,
including speed, speeding, lane keeping, following distance, and headway,
contextualized by roadway characteristics, vehicle classes, and driver
demographics. Such descriptions of normative driving behaviors can aid in the
development of vehicle safety and intelligent transportation systems. The
methodology is demonstrated using data from the Second Strategic Highway
Research Program (SHRP 2) NDS, which includes over 34 million miles of driving
across more than 3,400 drivers. Summaries of each driving metric were generated
using vehicle, GPS, and forward radar data. Additionally, interactive online
analytics tools were developed to visualize and compare driving behavior across
groups through dynamic data selection and grouping. For example, among drivers
on 65-mph roads for the SHRP 2 NDS, females aged 16-19 exceeded the speed limit
by 7.5 to 15 mph slightly more often than their male counterparts, and younger
drivers maintained headways under 1.5 seconds more frequently than older
drivers. This work supports better vehicle systems and safer infrastructure by
quantifying normative driving behaviors and offers a methodology for analyzing

*Waseem Akram,Muhayy Ud Din,Abdelhaleem Saad,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces AquaChat, a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) for intelligent and adaptable inspection of aquaculture net pens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve the adaptability and user-specific customization for inspecting underwater aquaculture environments, as traditional methods are limited in dynamic and challenging conditions.

Method: The authors propose a multi-layered system: a high-level planning layer interprets user commands via LLMs, a mid-level task manager converts tasks to control instructions, and a low-level motion control layer executes tasks. Real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning ensure adaptability.

Result: Experiments in simulated and controlled aquatic environments showed that AquaChat offered greater task flexibility, improved inspection accuracy, and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that integrating LLMs with marine robotics can lead to innovative, intelligent systems, transforming aquaculture management by enhancing adaptability and user interaction in underwater inspections.

Abstract: Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for maintaining the
structural integrity, biosecurity, and operational efficiency of fish farming
systems. Traditional inspection approaches rely on pre-programmed missions or
manual control, offering limited adaptability to dynamic underwater conditions
and user-specific demands. In this study, we propose AquaChat, a novel Remotely
Operated Vehicle (ROV) framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs)
for intelligent and adaptive net pen inspection. The system features a
multi-layered architecture: (1) a high-level planning layer that interprets
natural language user commands using an LLM to generate symbolic task plans;
(2) a mid-level task manager that translates plans into ROV control sequences;
and (3) a low-level motion control layer that executes navigation and
inspection tasks with precision. Real-time feedback and event-triggered
replanning enhance robustness in challenging aquaculture environments. The
framework is validated through experiments in both simulated and controlled
aquatic environments representative of aquaculture net pens. Results
demonstrate improved task flexibility, inspection accuracy, and operational
efficiency. AquaChat illustrates the potential of integrating language-based AI
with marine robotics to enable intelligent, user-interactive inspection systems
for sustainable aquaculture operations.

### [227] [Sensor-Space Based Robust Kinematic Control of Redundant Soft Manipulator by Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16842)
*Yinan Meng,Kun Qian,Jiong Yang,Renbo Su,Zhenhong Li,Charlie C. L. Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a kinematic control framework for redundant soft manipulators to enable robust operation under constraints like actuator saturation and confined environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of controlling soft manipulators, which include handling unknown external loads, avoiding actuator saturation, and ensuring effective movement in restricted spaces.

Method: The method involves a dual-learning strategy: (1) reinforcement learning for open-space control and (2) generative adversarial imitation learning for learning policies in confined spaces, combined with a sim-to-real transfer mechanism for deployment.

Result: The proposed approach achieves accurate path-following and object manipulation in confined environments under unknown loading conditions, as demonstrated with a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective and robust kinematic control of soft manipulators in challenging real-world conditions through innovative training and deployment mechanisms.

Abstract: The intrinsic compliance and high degree of freedom (DoF) of redundant soft
manipulators facilitate safe interaction and flexible task execution. However,
effective kinematic control remains highly challenging, as it must handle
deformations caused by unknown external loads and avoid actuator saturation due
to improper null-space regulation - particularly in confined environments. In
this paper, we propose a Sensor-Space Imitation Learning Kinematic Control
(SS-ILKC) framework to enable robust kinematic control under actuator
saturation and restrictive environmental constraints. We employ a dual-learning
strategy: a multi-goal sensor-space control framework based on reinforcement
learning principle is trained in simulation to develop robust control policies
for open spaces, while a generative adversarial imitation learning approach
enables effective policy learning from sparse expert demonstrations for
confined spaces. To enable zero-shot real-world deployment, a pre-processed
sim-to-real transfer mechanism is proposed to mitigate the
simulation-to-reality gap and accurately characterize actuator saturation
limits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively
control a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator, achieving precise
path-following and object manipulation in confined environments under unknown
loading conditions.

*Qing Tang,Xianbiao Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic programming model to optimize freeway merging by minimizing traffic delays and crash risks through analytical characterization and control of autonomous vehicle merging behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models fail to account for reduced flow rates during congestion at freeway merges caused by intersecting traffic, necessitating improved solutions for traffic efficiency and safety.

Method: An analytical formulation deriving effective discharge rates during merging and a dynamic programming model optimizing merging location and speed, with backward induction to minimize cost.

Result: Numerical experiments validate the model using the NGSIM dataset, showing it performs better than two benchmark algorithms in terms of efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: The model successfully improves traffic flow and safety during merging processes, offering a robust solution to dynamic queue propagation challenges.

Abstract: The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue
propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally,
queuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand
and fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during
congestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a
factor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an
analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging
of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the
first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the
multi-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed
form formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue
length and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a
crash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential
collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.
Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly
minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision
variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is
formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to
find the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset
validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the
proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more
efficient and safer merging process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs can enable mobile agents to process visual inputs and follow instructions, their deployment in real-world mobile tasks faces obstacles such as error recovery, long-horizon tasks, and cold-start in unfamiliar environments.

Method: MobileUse employs a hierarchical reflection architecture for error detection and recovery across multiple temporal scales and a proactive exploration module for improved understanding of novel environments.

Result: MobileUse achieved success rates of 62.9% on AndroidWorld and 44.2% on AndroidLab benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art records.

Conclusion: MobileUse offers a robust and adaptive solution for mobile task execution, leveraging hierarchical self-monitoring and exploration to address real-world challenges, and provides an open toolkit for practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled the
development of mobile agents that can understand visual inputs and follow user
instructions, unlocking new possibilities for automating complex tasks on
mobile devices. However, applying these models to real-world mobile scenarios
remains a significant challenge due to the long-horizon task execution,
difficulty in error recovery, and the cold-start problem in unfamiliar
environments. To address these challenges, we propose MobileUse, a GUI agent
designed for robust and adaptive mobile task execution. To improve resilience
in long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments, we introduce a hierarchical
reflection architecture that enables the agent to self-monitor, detect, and
recover from errors across multiple temporal scales-ranging from individual
actions to overall task completion-while maintaining efficiency through a
reflection-on-demand strategy. To tackle cold-start issues, we further
introduce a proactive exploration module, which enriches the agent's
understanding of the environment through self-planned exploration. Evaluations
on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks demonstrate that MobileUse
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving success rates of 62.9%
and 44.2%, respectively. To facilitate real-world applications, we release an
out-of-the-box toolkit for automated task execution on physical mobile devices,

Conclusion: The study offers an effective fatigue detection approach tailored for sensor-constrained scenarios, enhancing applicability in practical safety-critical fields.

Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such

rely on high-end sensors and controlled environments, limiting their
applicability in real world settings. This paper formally defines a practical
yet underexplored problem setting for real world fatigue detection, where
systems operating with context-appropriate sensors aim to leverage knowledge
from differently instrumented sources including those using impractical sensors
deployed in controlled environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
heterogeneous and multi-source fatigue detection framework that adaptively
utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while benefiting from
the diverse configurations present in source domains. Our experiments,
conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and two publicly
available datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved
generalization of our approach, paving the practical way for effective fatigue
monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: ResChebyKAN effectively enhances inertial positioning accuracy by combining advanced nonlinear modeling and improved dependency capturing strategies, showcasing a significant improvement over current benchmarks.

Abstract: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has become a key technology for achieving
low-cost and precise positioning. However, traditional CNN-based inertial
positioning methods struggle to capture the nonlinear motion characteristics
and long-term dependencies in IMU data. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel inertial positioning network with a generic backbone called
ResChebyKAN, which leverages the nonlinear approximation capabilities of
Chebyshev polynomials to model complex motion patterns. Additionally, we
introduce an Efficient Kernel-based Self-Attention (EKSA) module to effectively
capture contextual information and enhance long-term dependency modeling.
Experimental results on public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, RNIN-VIO, OxIOD,
IMUNet, and TLIO) demonstrate that our method reduces the absolute trajectory
error by 3.79% to 42.32% compared to existing benchmark methods. Furthermore,
we release a preprocessed dataset and empirically show that removing the
gravity component from acceleration data significantly improves inertial
positioning performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an RL-based shared control method for omnidirectional wheelchairs, ensuring user comfort and reducing cognitive load. This first real-world implementation shows improved navigation safety and smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current shared control methods for omnidirectional wheelchairs result in unintuitive user behavior and fail to maximize omnidirectional driving potential.

Method: The proposed approach uses reinforcement learning, mapping 2D user inputs to 3D motions while prioritizing user comfort. Training was conducted in Isaac Gym, and simulation tests were performed in Gazebo.

Result: The method achieved collision-free navigation with improved wheelchair orientation and better or competitive smoothness compared to non-learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the RL-based shared control's viability for omnidirectional wheelchairs, including successful sim-to-real implementation.

Abstract: Smart electric wheelchairs can improve user experience by supporting the
driver with shared control. State-of-the-art work showed the potential of
shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots.
However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive
behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional
driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which
takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and
reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and
tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and
reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort.
We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly
orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared
to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real
transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world
implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility
platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for learning model-free policies using 3D point clouds and proprioceptive touch for manipulating clusters of deformable objects, demonstrating zero-shot transfer success from simulation to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges include synthesizing realistic models, addressing perception uncertainties, and creating efficient spatial abstractions for manipulating deformable object clusters.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework is proposed, integrating a distributional state representation with kernel mean embeddings, using 3D point clouds and touch indicators for whole-arm contact-aware manipulation. It also introduces an occlusion heuristic for clearing deformables in exposure tasks.

Result: The framework performs well in power line clearance tasks, enabling agents to use creative multi-arm link strategies for de-occlusion, with successful policy transfer from simulation to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates an effective, model-free manipulation approach for deformable objects, achieving efficient training, real-time inference, and robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Manipulating clusters of deformable objects presents a substantial challenge
with widespread applicability, but requires contact-rich whole-arm
interactions. A potential solution must address the limited capacity for
realistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of
efficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for
learning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and
proprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body
contact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our
reinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state
representation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training
efficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel
context-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region
for exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario
and observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple
arm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy
transfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion
patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration method using spherical targets under noisy and corrupt conditions for outdoor multi-robot systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration for outdoor environments, especially for multi-robot systems, by addressing challenges such as target degradation and sensor noise.

Method: The method leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for image segmentation, a novel error-correction algorithm for 2D ellipse extraction, and a hierarchical weighted sum to handle noisy point clouds for robust sphere detection.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method robustly detects corrupted spheres and outperforms other targets, validated across different sensors and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is robust, reliable, and superior for LiDAR-camera calibration under various corruption types, usable in demanding outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel spherical target-based LiDAR-camera extrinsic
calibration method designed for outdoor environments with multi-robot systems,
considering both target and sensor corruption. The method extracts the 2D
ellipse center from the image and the 3D sphere center from the pointcloud,
which are then paired to compute the transformation matrix. Specifically, the
image is first decomposed using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Then, a novel
algorithm extracts an ellipse from a potentially corrupted sphere, and the
extracted center of ellipse is corrected for errors caused by the perspective
projection model. For the LiDAR pointcloud, points on the sphere tend to be
highly noisy due to the absence of flat regions. To accurately extract the
sphere from these noisy measurements, we apply a hierarchical weighted sum to
the accumulated pointcloud. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the
sphere can be robustly detected even under both types of corruption,
outperforming other targets. We evaluated our method using three different
types of LiDARs (spinning, solid-state, and non-repetitive) with cameras
positioned in three different locations. Furthermore, we validated the
robustness of our method to target corruption by experimenting with spheres
subjected to various types of degradation. These experiments were conducted in
both a planetary test and a field environment. Our code is available at

Result: The optimized leg structure reduced peak joint torques and energy consumption by over 20%, supported by dynamic simulation experiments in ADAMS.

Conclusion: This study validates the proposed design's efficiency, providing theoretical and technical support for next-generation heavy-load construction robots.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the construction industry, issues such as harsh
working environments, high-intensity and high-risk tasks, and labor shortages
have become increasingly prominent. This drives higher demands for construction
robots in terms of low energy consumption, high mobility, and high load
capacity. This paper focuses on the design and optimization of leg structures
for construction robots, aiming to improve their dynamic performance, reduce
energy consumption, and enhance load-bearing capabilities. Firstly, based on
the leg configuration of ants in nature, we design a structure for the robot's
leg. Secondly, we propose a novel structural optimization method. Using the
Lagrangian approach, a dynamic model of the leg was established. Combining the
dynamic model with the leg's motion trajectory, we formulated multiple dynamic
evaluation metrics and conducted a comprehensive optimization study on the
geometric parameters of each leg segment. The results show that the optimized
leg structure reduces peak joint torques and energy consumption by over 20%.
Finally, dynamic simulation experiments were conducted using ADAMS. The results
demonstrate a significant reduction in the driving power of each joint after
optimization, validating the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed
strategy. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support
for the design of heavy-load, high-performance construction robots.

Motivation: Traditional construction methods fail to meet modern efficiency and quality demands, especially in curtain wall installation.

Method: The researchers integrated a Denavit-Hartenberg model, hydraulic cylinder dynamics, and a Stribeck friction model, accompanied by systematic excitation signals and hierarchical parameter identification.

Result: Experimental validation showed residual standard deviations under 0.4 Nm between theoretical and measured torques, confirming precision in dynamic parameter identification.

Conclusion: The work enhances the intelligence level of curtain wall installation operations, addressing shortcomings in traditional construction approaches.

Abstract: In the construction industry, traditional methods fail to meet the modern
demands for efficiency and quality. The curtain wall installation is a critical
component of construction projects. We design a hydraulically driven robotic
arm for curtain wall installation and a dynamic parameter identification
method. We establish a Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) model based on measured robotic
arm structural parameters and integrate hydraulic cylinder dynamics to
construct a composite parametric system driven by a Stribeck friction model. By
designing high-signal-to-noise ratio displacement excitation signals for
hydraulic cylinders and combining Fourier series to construct optimal
excitation trajectories that satisfy joint constraints, this method effectively
excites the characteristics of each parameter in the minimal parameter set of
the dynamic model of the robotic arm. On this basis, a hierarchical progressive
parameter identification strategy is proposed: least squares estimation is
employed to separately identify and jointly calibrate the dynamic parameters of
both the hydraulic cylinder and the robotic arm, yielding Stribeck model curves
for each joint. Experimental validation on a robotic arm platform demonstrates
residual standard deviations below 0.4 Nm between theoretical and measured
joint torques, confirming high-precision dynamic parameter identification for
the hydraulic-driven curtain wall installation robotic arm. This significantly
contributes to enhancing the intelligence level of curtain wall installation
operations.

Conclusion: The proposed NSGA-III-FO algorithm effectively addresses multi-objective trajectory planning challenges, offering practical and efficient solutions for robotic curtain wall installation tasks in complex construction environments.

Abstract: In the context of labor shortages and rising costs, construction robots are
regarded as the key to revolutionizing traditional construction methods and
improving efficiency and quality in the construction industry. In order to
ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in
complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory
optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the
changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective
trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall
installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation,
integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its
physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper
proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO)
that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the
convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively
balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed
algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive
trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better
convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets
of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the
efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving
multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation
tasks.

Conclusion: Astribot Suite is a comprehensive step towards realizing intelligent robots capable of general-purpose and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Building general-purpose intelligent robots has long been a fundamental goal
of robotics. A promising approach is to mirror the evolutionary trajectory of
humans: learning through continuous interaction with the environment, with
early progress driven by the imitation of human behaviors. Achieving this goal
presents three core challenges: (1) designing safe robotic hardware with
human-level physical capabilities; (2) developing an intuitive and scalable
whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection; and (3) creating

### [241] [Falconry-like palm landing by a flapping-wing drone based on the human gesture interaction and distance-aware flight planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17144)
*Kazuki Numazato,Keiichiro Kan,Masaki Kitagawa,Yunong Li,Johannes Kubel,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a falconry-inspired system for flapping-wing drones, enabling safe palm landing interactions with humans using trajectory planning methods focused on physical and psychological safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of studies on practical human-drone interaction with biomimetic flapping-wing drones, such as enabling dynamic landings on humans.

Method: Designed a palm-landing trajectory planning system considering safety factors like velocity and distance, using a commercial flapping-wing drone and experimental validation.

Result: The proposed system successfully achieved safe and smooth hand landings, showcasing effective human-done contact-based interaction for the first time.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel physical interaction framework between humans and flapping-wing drones, opening possibilities for applications in constrained environments or crowded spaces.

Abstract: Flapping-wing drones have attracted significant attention due to their
biomimetic flight. They are considered more human-friendly due to their
characteristics such as low noise and flexible wings, making them suitable for
human-drone interactions. However, few studies have explored the practical
interaction between humans and flapping-wing drones. On establishing a physical
interaction system with flapping-wing drones, we can acquire inspirations from
falconers who guide birds of prey to land on their arms. This interaction
interprets the human body as a dynamic landing platform, which can be utilized
in various scenarios such as crowded or spatially constrained environments.
Thus, in this study, we propose a falconry-like interaction system in which a
flapping-wing drone performs a palm landing motion on a human hand. To achieve
a safe approach toward humans, we design a trajectory planning method that
considers both physical and psychological factors of the human safety such as
the drone's velocity and distance from the user. We use a commercial flapping
platform with our implemented motion planning and conduct experiments to
evaluate the palm landing performance and safety. The results demonstrate that
our approach enables safe and smooth hand landing interactions. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time to achieve a contact-based interaction
between flapping-wing drones and humans.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing autonomous driving by improving multi-agent trajectory prediction quality using a two-stage framework. It achieves state-of-the-art results in interactive trajectory prediction benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating high-quality predictions for low-probability trajectory modes in multi-agent scenarios, a critical aspect for autonomous vehicles.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) marginal prediction using trajectory type classification for mode diversity, and (2) joint prediction guided by key waypoints for better leveraging initial trajectory data.

Result: Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate JAM's competitive performance, outperforming other frameworks in benchmark comparisons.

Conclusion: JAM framework advances the state-of-the-art in interactive trajectory prediction, facilitating future research with publicly available code.

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of road participants is a critical task in
autonomous driving. In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality
generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle
this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework
named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware
marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction
process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to
learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information
for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint
prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals
from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We
explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in
better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial
predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world
Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show
that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the
framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction
frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory
prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/LinFunster/JAM to
facilitate future research.

### [243] [Reconfigurable Tendon-Driven Robots: Eliminating Inter-segmental Coupling via Independently Lockable Joints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17163)
*Botao Lin,Shuang Song,Jiaole Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) with innovative lockable joints to combat challenges like inter-segment coupling in traditional tendon-driven robots (TDRs), enhancing control while reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tendon-driven robots face challenges like intensified inter-segment coupling and complex control requirements as the number of segments increases.

Method: This study proposes a reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) with lockable joints controlled via antagonistic tendons, eliminating constant power supplies, inter-segment coupling, and the need for complex control systems.

Result: The RTR expands workspace, avoids inter-segment coupling, operates efficiently with fewer motors, and is validated through simulations, kinematics, statics modeling, and experiments.

Conclusion: The RTR design demonstrates effective reconfigurability, and its compact system achieves improved mobility and control in complex environments with fewer actuation resources.

Abstract: With a slender redundant body, the tendon-driven robot (TDR) has a large
workspace and great maneuverability while working in complex environments. TDR
comprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of
driving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances
dexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces
intensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control
requires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a
reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable
joints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through
a pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a
continuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively
actuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates
the inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex
coordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated
and compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further
revealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and
validation experiments have been conducted. Demonstrations have been performed
using a seven-joint RTR prototype to show its reconfigurability and moving
ability in complex environments with an actuator pack comprising only six
motors.

*Po-Yen Wu,Cheng-Yu Kuo,Yuki Kadokawa,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework to optimize tool usage for task completion while prolonging tool lifespan, validated in both simulated and real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robots learning tool-use strategies in uncertain environments, particularly balancing task efficiency with tool reliability.

Method: The method combines Finite Element Analysis and Miner's Rule to estimate tool lifespan, integrates Remaining Useful Life (RUL) into RL rewards, and introduces Adaptive Reward Normalization for stable policy learning.

Result: The framework successfully extends tool lifespan by up to 8.01x in simulations and is effectively transferable to real-world tasks like object-moving and door-opening.

Conclusion: By incorporating lifespan optimization into reinforcement learning, robots can achieve task efficiency while maintaining tool integrity, showcasing practical value in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely
on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are
not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive
to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot
learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's
lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a
factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based
on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide
policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL
can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward
Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on
estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across
simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and
Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies
consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer
effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of
learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA-Touch integrates tactile sensing into Vision-Language-Action models via two innovations: a tactile-language model for planning and a diffusion-based controller for precise manipulation. This improves efficiency and precision without fine-tuning the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models lack tactile sensing capabilities, limiting their performance in contact-rich tasks. Large multi-modal datasets needed for integration are absent.

Method: The authors introduce a pipeline leveraging a pretrained tactile-language model for semantic feedback and a diffusion-based controller to refine actions using tactile signals.

Result: Real-world experiments validate the approach, showing enhanced task planning efficiency and execution precision in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating tactile feedback via VLA-Touch presents a promising path for improving robot interaction in physical, contact-rich environments without needing to fine-tune existing models.

Abstract: Tactile feedback is generally recognized to be crucial for effective
interaction with the physical world. However, state-of-the-art
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use
tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks.
Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the
absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that
enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without
fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a
pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides
semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a
diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile
signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task
planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision. Code is open-sourced

Result: The proposed architecture outperformed state-of-the-art methods in robotic manipulation tasks on the Habitat Benchmark.

Conclusion: Active inference, when applied hierarchically, is effective and scalable for modern robotics benchmarks, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in active inference for robotic control, its

gap by introducing a fully hierarchical active inference architecture for
goal-directed behavior in realistic robotic settings. Our model combines a
high-level active inference model that selects among discrete skills realized
via a whole-body active inference controller. This unified approach enables
flexible skill composition, online adaptability, and recovery from task

*Tianshu Ruan,Aniketh Ramesh,Rustam Stolkin,Manolis Chiou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores how high-level semantics improve human-robot teams in disaster missions, reducing workload, increasing situational awareness, and enhancing trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the benefits of high-level semantics in enhancing Human-Robot Teams and Interaction, especially in high-stress and complex environments like disaster response missions.

Method: A semantics-based framework was applied to a mock disaster response mission to evaluate how semantic information affects operator workload, trust, and situational awareness.

Result: High-level semantics alleviate human operator workload, increase trust in situational awareness, improve reaction time for adjusting robot autonomy, and encourage teleoperation in systems with high trust.

Conclusion: Integrating high-level semantics into robot systems significantly benefits human-robot interaction by improving decision-making, reducing stress, and fostering trust in complex missions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of high-level semantics (evaluation
of the environment) on Human-Robot Teams (HRT) and Human-Robot Interaction
(HRI) in the context of mobile robot deployments. Although semantics has been
widely researched in AI, how high-level semantics can benefit the HRT paradigm
is underexplored, often fuzzy, and intractable. We applied a semantics-based
framework that could reveal different indicators of the environment (i.e. how
much semantic information exists) in a mock-up disaster response mission. In
such missions, semantics are crucial as the HRT should handle complex
situations and respond quickly with correct decisions, where humans might have
a high workload and stress. Especially when human operators need to shift their
attention between robots and other tasks, they will struggle to build
Situational Awareness (SA) quickly. The experiment suggests that the presented
semantics: 1) alleviate the perceived workload of human operators; 2) increase
the operator's trust in the SA; and 3) help to reduce the reaction time in
switching the level of autonomy when needed. Additionally, we find that
participants with higher trust in the system are encouraged by high-level
semantics to use teleoperation mode more.

Result: LOVMM demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization and multi-task learning abilities in simulated household environments, achieving higher success rates in tabletop manipulation tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LOVMM is a promising approach for addressing open-vocabulary mobile manipulation challenges in real-world, diverse household scenarios, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM) that involves the handling of
novel and unseen objects across different workspaces remains a significant
challenge for real-world robotic applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel Language-conditioned Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation framework, named
LOVMM, incorporating the large language model (LLM) and vision-language model
(VLM) to tackle various mobile manipulation tasks in household environments.
Our approach is capable of solving various OVMM tasks with free-form natural
language instructions (e.g. "toss the food boxes on the office room desk to the
trash bin in the corner", and "pack the bottles from the bed to the box in the
guestroom"). Extensive experiments simulated in complex household environments
show strong zero-shot generalization and multi-task learning abilities of
LOVMM. Moreover, our approach can also generalize to multiple tabletop

TL;DR: The paper studies confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models and proposes methods to improve trustworthiness through better uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to make robot behavior trustworthy by ensuring not only task success but also the reliable quantification of confidence in task outcomes.

Method: The study benchmarks VLA models across datasets, introduces prompt ensembles for confidence averaging, analyzes calibration over task timelines, and proposes action-wise Platt scaling for independent recalibration.

Result: The findings reveal no inherent tension between task performance and calibration, show improved confidence calibration through proposed methods, and identify points for risk-aware interventions.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational tools and insights necessary for enhancing both performance and trustworthiness of VLAs through robust uncertainty quantification methods.

Abstract: Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but
also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this
end, we present the first systematic study of confidence calibration in
vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations
and natural-language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We begin
with extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between
task success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants,
finding that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Next, we
introduce prompt ensembles for VLAs, a lightweight, Bayesian-inspired algorithm
that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions and consistently
improves calibration. We further analyze calibration over the task time
horizon, showing that confidence is often most reliable after making some
progress, suggesting natural points for risk-aware intervention. Finally, we
reveal differential miscalibration across action dimensions and propose
action-wise Platt scaling, a method to recalibrate each action dimension
independently to produce better confidence estimates. Our aim in this study is
to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render
VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty
quantification.

Conclusion: This dataset advances the training of perception systems for recognizing affordances and assists with studies on task preparation and collaboration for service robots.

Abstract: Affordances - i.e. possibilities for action that an environment or objects in
it provide - are important for robots operating in human environments to
perceive. Existing approaches train such capabilities on annotated static
images or shapes. This work presents a novel dataset for affordance learning of
common household tasks. Unlike previous approaches, our dataset consists of
video sequences demonstrating the tasks from first- and third-person
perspectives, along with metadata about the affordances that are manifested in
the task, and is aimed towards training perception systems to recognize
affordance manifestations. The demonstrations were collected from several
participants and in total record about seven hours of human activity. The
variety of task performances also allows studying preparatory maneuvers that
people may perform for a task, such as how they arrange their task space, which
is also relevant for collaborative service robots.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndoorBEV, a mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method to enhance object detection in complex indoor 3D point clouds for robotic applications by utilizing a mask-centric approach rather than bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing robotic perception in complex indoor environments with diverse object shapes and clutter where traditional bounding box methods struggle.

Method: IndoorBEV uses a 3D-to-2D projection to create a BEV map, employs a compact encoder and a window-based backbone for feature extraction, and leverages a query-based decoder to predict object classes and instance masks.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved capabilities in detecting both static and dynamic objects with diverse shapes using a custom indoor dataset.

Conclusion: IndoorBEV offers a robust solution for indoor scene understanding, benefiting robotic tasks like navigation, motion prediction, and planning.

Abstract: Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents
significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object
shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where
traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we
propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor
mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles
naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to
distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results
is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion
prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and
a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A
query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently
predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric
formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic
objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding
box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom
indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects
  and dynamic elements like robots and miscellaneous items, showcasing its
potential for robust indoor scene understanding.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular algorithm to enhance terrain-aware planning for multi-UAV systems, enabling better 3D reconstructions by addressing key limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mCPP algorithms inadequately consider the 3D structural aspects of regions of interest, leading to poor reconstruction of vertical and occluded surfaces.

Method: The authors extend the DARP algorithm to DARP-3D, integrating terrain-aware adjustments for altitude and camera orientation to improve path planning.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests show that DARP-3D consistently achieves better 3D reconstruction quality compared to baseline methods, particularly for vertical features.

Conclusion: DARP-3D improves multi-UAV path planning for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. It is validated through simulations and real-world testing, with the algorithm openly available for broader use.

Abstract: Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) algorithms in popular commercial
software typically treat a Region of Interest (RoI) only as a 2D plane,
ignoring important3D structure characteristics. This leads to incomplete
3Dreconstructions, especially around occluded or vertical surfaces. In this
paper, we propose a modular algorithm that can extend commercial
two-dimensional path planners to facilitate terrain-aware planning by adjusting
altitude and camera orientations. To demonstrate it, we extend the well-known
DARP (Divide Areas for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning) algorithm
and produce DARP-3D. We present simulation results in multiple 3D environments
and a real-world flight test using DJI hardware. Compared to baseline, our
approach consistently captures improved 3D reconstructions, particularly in
areas with significant vertical features. An open-source implementation of the
algorithm is available here:https://github.com/konskara/TerraPlan

Conclusion: InstructVLA successfully bridges human-like intuitive reasoning with robotic policy learning, excelling in multimodal tasks and manipulation performance for various simulated and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal
reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing
vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow
their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible
reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading
manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,
Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal
training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual
reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated
650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves
30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce
SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and
high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA
by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA
surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling
by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both
simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's
potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with
efficient policy learning.

*Abdel-Raouf Dannaoui,Johann Laconte,Christophe Debain,Francois Pomerleau,Paul Checchin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of robust lidar-based relocalization in dynamic outdoor environments by presenting a dataset and evaluation framework for short-term environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address the underexplored issue of short-term environmental changes impacting autonomous systems' localization in dynamic outdoor conditions.

Method: A short-term, multi-temporal dataset collected weekly over two months is used. The dataset includes high-density point clouds, panoramic images, and trajectory data, allowing for noise-affected scan-to-map alignment analysis using two ICP variants: Point-to-Point and Point-to-Plane.

Result: Point-to-Plane ICP shows superior accuracy and stability compared to Point-to-Point ICP, particularly in environments with sparse features or dense vegetation.

Conclusion: The paper provides a valuable dataset and framework for evaluating localization robustness and highlights the importance of local geometry and environmental factors in designing resilient robotic systems.

Abstract: Robust relocalization in dynamic outdoor environments remains a key challenge
for autonomous systems relying on 3D lidar. While long-term localization has
been widely studied, short-term environmental changes, occurring over days or
weeks, remain underexplored despite their practical significance. To address
this gap, we present a highresolution, short-term multi-temporal dataset
collected weekly from February to April 2025 across natural and semi-urban
settings. Each session includes high-density point cloud maps, 360 deg
panoramic images, and trajectory data. Projected lidar scans, derived from the
point cloud maps and modeled with sensor-accurate occlusions, are used to
evaluate alignment accuracy against the ground truth using two Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) variants: Point-to-Point and Point-to-Plane. Results show
that Point-to-Plane offers significantly more stable and accurate registration,
particularly in areas with sparse features or dense vegetation. This study
provides a structured dataset for evaluating short-term localization
robustness, a reproducible framework for analyzing scan-to-map alignment under
noise, and a comparative evaluation of ICP performance in evolving outdoor
environments. Our analysis underscores how local geometry and environmental
variability affect localization success, offering insights for designing more
resilient robotic systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating clinical expertise of therapists with robotics for enhanced neurorehabilitation through a framework enabling human-human interaction via robotic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neurorehabilitation lacks adaptable robotic systems that fully utilize trained therapists' expertise, prompting a need to harmonize manual therapy with robotics.

Method: Researchers propose a novel framework combining robotics with social psychology principles, a unified taxonomy, and seamless technological facilitation for human-human interaction in rehabilitation.

Result: The paper consolidates rationale and approaches from multidisciplinary teams to promote a new robot-mediated human-human interaction method linking therapists and patients via robotics.

Conclusion: Integrating robotic precision with therapists' clinical insights bridges gaps in conventional and robotic neurorehabilitation, offering a pathway for advanced therapeutic interaction.

Abstract: Neurorehabilitation conventionally relies on the interaction between a
patient and a physical therapist. Robotic systems can improve and enrich the
physical feedback provided to patients after neurological injury, but they
under-utilize the adaptability and clinical expertise of trained therapists. In
this position paper, we advocate for a novel approach that integrates the
therapist's clinical expertise and nuanced decision-making with the strength,
accuracy, and repeatability of robotics: Robot-mediated physical Human-Human
Interaction. This framework, which enables two individuals to physically
interact through robotic devices, has been studied across diverse research
groups and has recently emerged as a promising link between conventional manual
therapy and rehabilitation robotics, harmonizing the strengths of both
approaches. This paper presents the rationale of a multidisciplinary
team-including engineers, doctors, and physical therapists-for conducting
research that utilizes: a unified taxonomy to describe robot-mediated
rehabilitation, a framework of interaction based on social psychology, and a
technological approach that makes robotic systems seamless facilitators of
natural human-human interaction.

*Antoine Groudiev,Fabian Schramm,Éloïse Berthier,Justin Carpentier,Frederike Dümbgen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper extends the Kernel Sum of Squares (KernelSOS) framework to tackle control and estimation problems with challenging local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in solving optimization problems with poor local minima by combining sum of squares methods and kernel methods.

Method: The paper utilizes the KernelSOS framework for both control and estimation problems and applies it to trajectory optimization using black-box simulators.

Result: KernelSOS proves competitive with other sum of squares approaches in estimation, handles non-polynomial and non-parametric issues, and performs well in trajectory optimization settings.

Conclusion: KernelSOS demonstrates versatility and effectiveness, particularly when serving as an initialization method for local solvers or as a standalone solution in control and estimation tasks.

Abstract: Global optimization has gained attraction over the past decades, thanks to
the development of both theoretical foundations and efficient numerical
routines to cope with optimization problems of various complexities. Among
recent methods, Kernel Sum of Squares (KernelSOS) appears as a powerful
framework, leveraging the potential of sum of squares methods from the
polynomial optimization community with the expressivity of kernel methods
widely used in machine learning. This paper applies the kernel sum of squares
framework for solving control and estimation problems, which exhibit poor local
minima. We demonstrate that KernelSOS performs well on a selection of problems
from both domains. In particular, we show that KernelSOS is competitive with
other sum of squares approaches on estimation problems, while being applicable
to non-polynomial and non-parametric formulations. The sample-based nature of
KernelSOS allows us to apply it to trajectory optimization problems with an
integrated simulator treated as a black box, both as a standalone method and as
a powerful initialization method for local solvers, facilitating the discovery
of better solutions.

### [260] [Event Detection for Active Lower Limb Prosthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17649)
*J. D. Clark,P. Ellison*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores how cruciate ligament stretch in a bicondylar knee design affects event detection in gait cycles, with potential advantages for improving powered prosthetic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance event detection for prosthetics and better replicate natural knee kinematics by addressing limitations in simplified pin joint models.

Method: The researchers used bicondylar knee analogues constrained by artificial ligaments, recording ligament stretch during treadmill gait cycles at three speeds using LVDTs.

Result: Speed-dependent cruciate ligament stretch was observed during specific gait cycle stages, which may serve as predictive markers for initial contact and other static events.

Conclusion: The bicondylar knee design effectively captures kinematic nuances and could improve event detection accuracy, benefiting the control of powered prosthetics.

Abstract: Accurate event detection is key to the successful design of semi-passive and
powered prosthetics. Kinematically, the natural knee is complex, with
translation and rotation components that have a substantial impact on gait
characteristics. When simplified to a pin joint, some of this behaviour is
lost. This study investigates the role of cruciate ligament stretch in event
detection. A bicondylar knee design was used, constrained by analogues of the
anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. This offers the ability to
characterize knee kinematics by the stretch of the ligaments. The ligament
stretch was recorded using LVDTs parallel to the ligaments of the Russell knee
on a bent knee crutch. Which was used to capture data on a treadmill at 3
speeds. This study finds speed dependence within the stretch of the cruciate
ligaments, prominently around 5\% and 80\% of the gait cycle for the posterior
and anterior. The cycle profile remains consistent with speed; therefore, other
static events such as the turning point feature at around 90\% and 95\% of the
cycle, for the posterior and anterior, respectively, could be used as a
predictive precursor for initial contact. Likewise at 90\% and 95\%, another
pair of turning points that in this case could be used to predict foot flat.
This concludes that the use of a bicondylar knee design could improve the
detection of events during the gait cycle, and therefore could increase the
accuracy of subsequent controllers for powered prosthetics.

### [261] [Safety Assurance for Quadrotor Kinodynamic Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17679)
*Theodoros Tavoulareas,Marzia Cescon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses safety issues in autonomous drone navigation by proposing a method that combines a geometric planner with a safety assurance filter to ensure collision-free and safe operational trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of autonomous drones in civilian applications raises concerns about ensuring safe operation to prevent physical harm, pollution, and risks to human life.

Method: The method involves a two-step process: using a sampling-based geometric planner for high-level collision-free path planning and a low-level safety assurance filter integrated with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for safe trajectory tracking.

Result: The proposed approach effectively ensures safety in a restricted 3D simulation environment using a Crazyflie 2.0 drone model.

Conclusion: By integrating runtime safety assurance into kinodynamic motion planning, the approach offers a robust safety guarantee for drone operations, paving the way for safer autonomous systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous drones have gained considerable attention for applications in
real-world scenarios, such as search and rescue, inspection, and delivery. As
their use becomes ever more pervasive in civilian applications, failure to
ensure safe operation can lead to physical damage to the system, environmental
pollution, and even loss of human life. Recent work has demonstrated that
motion planning techniques effectively generate a collision-free trajectory
during navigation. However, these methods, while creating the motion plans, do
not inherently consider the safe operational region of the system, leading to
potential safety constraints violation during deployment. In this paper, we
propose a method that leverages run time safety assurance in a kinodynamic
motion planning scheme to satisfy the system's operational constraints. First,
we use a sampling-based geometric planner to determine a high-level
collision-free path within a user-defined space. Second, we design a low-level
safety assurance filter to provide safety guarantees to the control input of a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed with the purpose of trajectory
tracking. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a restricted 3D simulation
environment using a model of the Crazyflie 2.0 drone.

### [262] [CA-Cut: Crop-Aligned Cutout for Data Augmentation to Learn More Robust Under-Canopy Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17727)
*Robel Mamo,Taeyeong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel data augmentation method, Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut), aimed at enhancing model robustness for visual under-canopy navigation by simulating real-world occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual under-canopy navigation methods rely on deep learning models that require extensive, costly data collection for real-world reliability, with current augmentation techniques being insufficient for complex under-canopy scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes the Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut) augmentation technique that strategically masks regions around crop rows in images to train models to capture high-level contextual features even in the presence of occlusions.

Result: Experiments with a public cornfield dataset show that CA-Cut improves prediction accuracy, enhances generalizability, and reduces error by up to 36.9%.

Conclusion: The proposed CA-Cut augmentation method effectively boosts the performance and robustness of visual navigation models in complex environments, outperforming traditional augmentation techniques.

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with
deep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from
crop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they
require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world
field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant
human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this
challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during
model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to
diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we
hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to
suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with
frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we
propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)
which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed
around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level
contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our
extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that
masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and
significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual
navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward
crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and
generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction
in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the
number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks
to maximize overall performance.

### [263] [Evaluating Uncertainty and Quality of Visual Language Action-enabled Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17049)
*Pablo Valle,Chengjie Lu,Shaukat Ali,Aitor Arrieta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel metrics to evaluate Visual Language Action (VLA) models beyond task success rates, focusing on task quality and model confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices rely only on binary task success rates, which fail to assess the quality of task execution and confidence in VLA models.

Method: The authors proposed eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics, tested through 908 executions of robotic tasks, and compared their correlation to human expert judgments.

Result: Several proposed metrics were strongly correlated with human assessments, effectively distinguishing task execution qualities, even for unsuccessful tasks.

Conclusion: This study underscores the need for enhanced evaluation frameworks for VLA models, advocating better monitoring and adaptability in robotic systems.

Abstract: Visual Language Action (VLA) models are a multi-modal class of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems that integrate visual perception, natural language
understanding, and action planning to enable agents to interpret their
environment, comprehend instructions, and perform embodied tasks autonomously.
Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds
of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to
capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its
decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality
metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We
assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908
successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four
representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually
labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our
proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics
show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their
utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found
that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and
low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when
test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current
evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way
for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled
robotic systems.

*Danushka Liyanage,Nelum Attanayake,Zijian Luo,Rahul Gopinath*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of statistical reachability estimators in fuzzing by proposing synthetic ground truth benchmarks and testing on real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of accurate measurement tools for estimating achievable coverage during fuzz testing, which is critical for software reliability.

Method: The authors propose a synthetic program generation framework for creating reliable ground truth benchmarks and use statistical methods to evaluate estimators' reliability on real-world programs.

Result: The study provides a protocol and evaluation framework for verifying the reliability of current and future reachability estimators in fuzzing.

Conclusion: The research contributes to improving fuzzing practices by introducing tools and benchmarks to measure reachability estimators more accurately, benefiting software testing overall.

Abstract: Background: Fuzzers are often guided by coverage, making the estimation of
maximum achievable coverage a key concern in fuzzing. However, achieving 100%
coverage is infeasible for most real-world software systems, regardless of
effort. While static reachability analysis can provide an upper bound, it is
often highly inaccurate. Recently, statistical estimation methods based on
species richness estimators from biostatistics have been proposed as a
potential solution. Yet, the lack of reliable benchmarks with labeled ground
truth has limited rigorous evaluation of their accuracy.
  Objective: This work examines the reliability of reachability estimators from
two axes: addressing the lack of labeled ground truth and evaluating their
reliability on real-world programs.
  Methods: (1) To address the challenge of labeled ground truth, we propose an
evaluation framework that synthetically generates large programs with complex
control flows, ensuring well-defined reachability and providing ground truth
for evaluation. (2) To address the criticism from use of synthetic benchmarks,
we adapt a reliability check for reachability estimators on real-world
benchmarks without labeled ground truth -- by varying the size of sampling
units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate.
  Results: These two studies together will help answer the question of whether
current reachability estimators are reliable, and defines a protocol to
evaluate future improvements in reachability estimation.

*Taher A. Ghaleb,Dulina Rathnayake*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates six Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating GitHub Actions CI configurations, finding that the current models show limitations when generating precise YAML-based outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of manually writing error-prone YAML configurations for CI services and explore whether LLMs can automate this task.

Method: Six LLMs (three general-purpose and three code-pretrained models) were evaluated using a newly constructed labeled dataset pairing natural language descriptions with best-practice YAML configurations.

Result: Zero-shot prompting resulted in similarity scores as high as 69% but only yielded 3% perfect matches. Code-pretrained models slightly underperformed compared to general-purpose ones.

Conclusion: LLMs currently face limitations in precisely generating executable CI configurations. Improving LLM alignment with configuration languages is essential for advancing automation in CI tools.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions, require
developers to write YAML-based configurations, which can be tedious and
error-prone. Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
automate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI
configurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study
evaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural
language descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models
(GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code
Llama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind,
constructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with
corresponding best-practice YAML configurations. Zero-shot prompting achieves
up to 69% similarity with the ground truth, with only 3% perfect matches.
Code-pretrained models slightly underperform compared to general-purpose ones
in YAML-based CI tasks, revealing LLM limitations for CI configuration
generation. Analyzing GPT-4o outputs reveals issues like missing or renamed
steps, misinterpreted descriptions, and unnecessary additions that may affect
structural and contextual correctness, indicating a gap between generation
quality and the precision required for executable CI configurations. Our
research offers insights for improving LLM alignment with configuration
languages and guiding future efforts on CI automation and tooling support.

Motivation: To address challenges in software testing, static analysis, and malware detection caused by prevalent JavaScript obfuscation.

Method: Integrates Gemini to identify core prelude functions with JSIR for deterministic code transformations, recovering semantic details and program behavior.

Result: CASCADE is deployed in Google's environment, showing marked efficiency improvements and reducing reverse engineering efforts.

Conclusion: CASCADE effectively overcomes limitations of traditional deobfuscation techniques, proving reliable and flexible in enhancing code analysis and comprehension.

Abstract: Software obfuscation, particularly prevalent in JavaScript, hinders code
comprehension and analysis, posing significant challenges to software testing,
static analysis, and malware detection. This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel
hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with
the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate
Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to
identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the
most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code
transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original
strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method
overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques,
eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving
reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production
environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation
efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.

Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum software requires improved methods for verification and validation, particularly in unit testing, to ensure reliability and scalability.

Method: The authors analyzed 1,796,880 mutated quantum circuits using empirical studies, involving classical and quantum tests (e.g., Statevector, Swap, and the new Inverse test) to compare their performance.

Result: Quantum-centric tests, especially the Statevector and Inverse tests, were found to outperform statistical tests by reducing false positives and negatives, and improving precision and efficiency.

Conclusion: Adopting quantum-centric testing strategies can significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of quantum software, paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of quantum software presents significant challenges
for software verification and validation, particularly in the context of unit
testing. This work presents a comprehensive study on quantum-centric unit
tests, comparing traditional statistical approaches with tests specifically
designed for quantum circuits. These include tests that run only on a classical
computer, such as the Statevector test, as well as those executable on quantum
hardware, such as the Swap test and the novel Inverse test. Through an
empirical study and detailed analysis on 1,796,880 mutated quantum circuits, we
investigate (a) each test's ability to detect subtle discrepancies between the
expected and actual states of a quantum circuit, and (b) the number of
measurements required to achieve high reliability. The results demonstrate that
quantum-centric tests, particularly the Statevector test and the Inverse test,
provide clear advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, reducing both
false positives and false negatives compared to statistical tests. This work
contributes to the development of more robust and scalable strategies for
testing quantum software, supporting the future adoption of fault-tolerant
quantum computers and promoting more reliable practices in quantum software

TL;DR: This paper studies the needs and challenges faced by developers in prompt programming for foundation models, creating a taxonomy of tasks and questions, and comparing it with available tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in knowledge about the tasks and questions developers face during prompt programming, and to evaluate if existing tools meet their needs.

Method: The study involved developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks and 51 questions by interviewing 16 prompt programmers, observing 8 developers, and surveying 50 developers, then comparing the taxonomy to 48 research and commercial tools.

Result: The study identified that prompt programming is poorly supported, with all tasks done manually and 16 of the 51 questions unanswered, highlighting inadequacies in current tools.

Conclusion: The paper highlights significant gaps in prompt programming tools and outlines opportunities for creating better support for developers.

Abstract: Prompting foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have
enabled new AI-powered software features (e.g., text summarization) that
previously were only possible by fine-tuning FMs. Now, developers are embedding
prompts in software, known as prompt programs. The process of prompt
programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet,
the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the
answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With
the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is
unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We
address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt
programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task
and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make
prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48
research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not
well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions --
including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on
this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.

TL;DR: This study highlights setbacks and solutions for a distributed real-time analytics system project facing integration challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges in integrating distributed components in systems reliant on edge computing and machine learning.

Method: The authors conduct a root cause analysis focusing on technical, organizational, and psychological barriers encountered during final-stage integration.

Result: The project achieved minimal functionality—only six minutes—due to technical and organizational flaws, far below the desired outcome.

Conclusion: Simulation-driven engineering, structured cycles, and early mock-based deployments are essential for reducing risk and complexity in such projects.

Abstract: This experience report analyses a one year project focused on building a
distributed real-time analytics system using edge computing and machine
learning. The project faced critical setbacks due to a big-bang integration
approach, where all components developed by multiple geographically dispersed
partners were merged at the final stage. The integration effort resulted in
only six minutes of system functionality, far below the expected 40 minutes.
Through root cause analysis, the study identifies technical and organisational
barriers, including poor communication, lack of early integration testing, and
resistance to topdown planning. It also considers psychological factors such as
a bias toward fully developed components over mockups. The paper advocates for
early mock based deployment, robust communication infrastructures, and the
adoption of topdown thinking to manage complexity and reduce risk in reactive,
distributed projects. These findings underscore the limitations of traditional
Agile methods in such contexts and propose simulation-driven engineering and
structured integration cycles as key enablers for future success.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-step approach, Seed&Steer, to enhance Large Language Model (LLM)-based unit test generation by decoupling initialization and assertion challenges. It shows improvements in compilation rates and code coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in automated unit test generation using LLMs, specifically overcoming the limitations of initialization complexity and assertion generation to enhance test compilation success and coverage metrics.

Method: Seed&Steer, a two-step approach, integrates traditional unit testing tools like EvoSuite to guide LLMs in creating method invocations and branching cues. This combination supports diverse execution paths and improves assertion generation.

Result: The approach improves the compilation pass rate by ~7%, successfully compiles hundreds of previously failing cases, and achieves up to 73% branch and line coverage in Java projects with coverage improvements up to 1.26* compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Seed&Steer effectively combines traditional and LLM-based techniques to advance automated unit test generation, with measurable improvements in compilation success and test coverage.

Abstract: Unit tests play a vital role in the software development lifecycle. Recent
advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly
improved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and
industry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by
decoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their
respective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic
Complexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation,
revealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the
latter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose
Seed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing
techniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages
conventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations
with high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in
constructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help
LLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception
cases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on
five real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show
that Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%,
successfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. It
also achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of
varying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*. Our
code, dataset, and experimental scripts will be publicly released to support
future research and reproducibility.

### [272] [How Do Code Smells Affect Skill Growth in Scratch Novice Programmers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17314)
*Ricardo Hidalgo Aragón,Jesús M. González-Barahona,Gregorio Robles*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates the relationship between computational-thinking (CT) skills and design-level code smells in Scratch projects by using data analytics on approximately 2 million public projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the significance of code smells in block-based programming environments like Scratch, especially in their connection to computational-thinking skills among novices.

Method: The study analyzes a random sample of ~2 million Scratch projects using open-source linters to extract CT scores and code smell data. It employs data pre-processing, descriptive analytics, robust correlation tests, cross-validation, and machine-learning models, with contextual qualitative checks.

Result: The research intends to create the first large-scale association map between CT skills and code smells. This aims to inform educational practices, establish benchmarks for interventions, and offer publicly available datasets and reproducible tools.

Conclusion: The work strengthens both educational theory and practical tools by demonstrating how design flaws in programming influence the development of computational skills in early learners.

Abstract: Context. Code smells, which are recurring anomalies in design or style, have
been extensively researched in professional code. However, their significance
in block-based projects created by novices is still largely unknown.
Block-based environments such as Scratch offer a unique, data-rich setting to
examine how emergent design problems intersect with the cultivation of
computational-thinking (CT) skills. Objective. This research explores the
connection between CT proficiency and design-level code smells--issues that may
hinder software maintenance and evolution--in programs created by Scratch
developers. We seek to identify which CT dimensions align most strongly with
which code smells and whether task context moderates those associations.
Method. A random sample of aprox. 2 million public Scratch projects is mined.
Using open-source linters, we extract nine CT scores and 40 code smell
indicators from these projects. After rigorous pre-processing, we apply
descriptive analytics, robust correlation tests, stratified cross-validation,
and exploratory machine-learning models; qualitative spot-checks contextualize
quantitative patterns. Impact. The study will deliver the first large-scale,
fine-grained map linking specific CT competencies to concrete design flaws and
antipatterns. Results are poised to (i) inform evidence-based curricula and
automated feedback systems, (ii) provide effect-size benchmarks for future
educational interventions, and (iii) supply an open, pseudonymized dataset and
reproducible analysis pipeline for the research community. By clarifying how
programming habits influence early skill acquisition, the work advances both
computing-education theory and practical tooling for sustainable software
maintenance and evolution.

### [273] [Roseau: Fast, Accurate, Source-based API Breaking Change Analysis in Java](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17369)
*Corentin Latappy,Thomas Degueule,Jean-Rémy Falleri,Romain Robbes,Lina Ochoa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Roseau, a tool for technology-agnostic API modeling and analysis, which improves upon traditional tools like JApiCmp and Revapi by supporting both source code and bytecode and enabling large-scale longitudinal API evolution studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing tools like JApiCmp and Revapi, which depend on binary JARs and thus hinder large-scale longitudinal studies and commit-level detection of API breaking changes.

Method: The paper proposes a novel static analysis tool, Roseau, which constructs technology-agnostic API models with rich semantic analyses and supports both source code and bytecode inputs for analyzing API evolution and detecting breaking changes (BCs).

Result: Roseau achieves an F1 accuracy of 0.99, outperforming JApiCmp (F1: 0.86) and Revapi (F1: 0.91). It demonstrates high performance, analyzing breaking changes between versions in under two seconds for libraries with extensive codebases.

Conclusion: Roseau is a superior tool for API evolution studies, enabling faster and more accurate detection of breaking changes and supporting large-scale and longitudinal studies, illustrated through experiments on popular libraries and a comprehensive analysis of the Guava API.

Abstract: Understanding API evolution and the introduction of breaking changes (BCs) in
software libraries is essential for library maintainers to manage backward
compatibility and for researchers to conduct empirical studies on software
library evolution. In Java, tools such as JApiCmp and Revapi are commonly used
to detect BCs between library releases, but their reliance on binary JARs
limits their applicability. This restriction hinders large-scale longitudinal
studies of API evolution and fine-grained analyses such as commit-level BC
detection. In this paper, we introduce Roseau, a novel static analysis tool
that constructs technology-agnostic API models from library code equipped with
rich semantic analyses. API models can be analyzed to study API evolution and
compared to identify BCs between any two versions of a library (releases,
commits, branches, etc.). Unlike traditional approaches, Roseau can build API
models from source code or bytecode, and is optimized for large-scale
longitudinal analyses of library histories. We assess the accuracy,
performance, and suitability of Roseau for longitudinal studies of API
evolution, using JApiCmp and Revapi as baselines. We extend and refine an
established benchmark of BCs and show that Roseau achieves higher accuracy (F1
= 0.99) than JApiCmp (F1 = 0.86) and Revapi (F1 = 0.91). We analyze 60 popular
libraries from Maven Central and find that Roseau delivers excellent
performance, detecting BCs between versions in under two seconds, including in
libraries with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We further illustrate
the limitations of JApiCmp and Revapi for longitudinal studies and the novel
analysis capabilities offered by Roseau by tracking the evolution of Google's
Guava API and the introduction of BCs over 14 years and 6,839 commits, reducing
analysis times from a few days to a few minutes.

*Tianlin Li,Yunxiang Wei,Zhiming Li,Aishan Liu,Qing Guo,Xianglong Liu,Dongning Sun,Yang Liu*

TL;DR: This paper explores training data detection (TDD) for CodeLLMs to address risks of sensitive code inclusion, creating a benchmark dataset and assessing TDD methods under various mutation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of CodeLLMs raises concerns about privacy and intellectual property due to the reproduction of sensitive code snippets trained on proprietary datasets.

Method: The authors introduce CodeSnitch, a benchmark dataset, and evaluate 7 state-of-the-art TDD methods on 8 CodeLLMs, using mutation strategies grounded in code clone detection taxonomy.

Result: The study systematically evaluates existing TDD methods' effectiveness and robustness using the benchmark and mutation strategies, identifying strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: It provides insights into improving TDD methodologies for code, highlighting challenges specific to code's structured syntax and similarity criteria.

Abstract: Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them
indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models
occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code
snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data,
and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible
and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become
a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural
language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely
underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured
syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To
address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven
state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance
across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a
function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three
programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded
from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design
targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three
distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the
well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study
provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers
insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection
methods in the future.

### [275] [AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542)
*Lara Khatib,Noble Saji Mathews,Meiyappan Nagappan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AssertFlip, a method using large language models (LLMs) to generate Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) by first creating passing tests and then flipping them to detect bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bug reproduction often lacks proper tests when bugs are first reported, making debugging and fixing bugs more difficult.

Method: AssertFlip employs a two-step approach: it first uses LLMs to create passing tests for buggy behavior and then inverts these tests so they fail when the bug exists.

Result: AssertFlip demonstrated a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset, outperforming other methods on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: The results validate that AssertFlip is a more effective technique for generating BRTs by leveraging LLMs to target passing tests first, then converting them to failing ones.

Abstract: Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process,
yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable
tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and
resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we
introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug
Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing
methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first
generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to
fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing
passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that
AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a
benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass
success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.

### [276] [CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548)
*Lingxiao Tang,He Ye,Zhongxin Liu,Xiaoxue Ren,Lingfeng Bao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeReasoner improves code reasoning capabilities by addressing dataset quality and fine-tuning limitations, achieving significant gains over prior methods and even surpassing GPT-4o in specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code reasoning is critical for tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair, but current methods using supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize and show limited improvements.

Method: A two-stage method is proposed: 1) constructing datasets focusing on Python execution logic, followed by instruction tuning with knowledge from a teacher model, and 2) using GRPO reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning and generalization.

Result: CodeReasoner achieves a 27.1% to 40.2% performance improvement on code reasoning benchmarks with a 7B model, matches GPT-4o in key areas, and outperforms GPT-4o when scaled to 14B.

Conclusion: Addressing data and training limitations yields substantial enhancement in executing reasoning tasks, confirming the importance of dataset construction and structured training stages.

Abstract: Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs)
in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's
execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether
a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for
downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior
approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code
reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize
across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low
quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which
struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we
propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a
two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets
that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply
instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a
powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through
GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on
three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves
performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the
7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction.
When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks.
Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight
the importance of reasoning chains.

### [277] [Contextual Code Retrieval for Commit Message Generation: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17690)
*Bo Xiong,Linghao Zhang,Chong Wang,Peng Liang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces C3Gen, a method to improve commit message generation (CMG) by incorporating additional contextual code snippets from the repository, leading to more informative and practical commit messages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMG methods rely solely on code diffs, which lack the full context necessary to produce high-quality and comprehensive commit messages.

Method: This paper proposes C3Gen, a contextual code retrieval-based approach that retrieves commit-relevant code snippets and integrates them into the input for CMG models, enhancing the available context.

Result: C3Gen demonstrates effectiveness through experiments across models, objectively and subjectively, showing that it generates more comprehensive and contextually-rich commit messages. A human evaluation further supports its practical value.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual code into commit message generation significantly improves the output's quality and practicality, providing insights and addressing concerns about current CMG evaluation metrics.

Abstract: A commit message describes the main code changes in a commit and plays a
crucial role in software maintenance. Existing commit message generation (CMG)
approaches typically frame it as a direct mapping which inputs a code diff and
produces a brief descriptive sentence as output. However, we argue that relying
solely on the code diff is insufficient, as raw code diff fails to capture the
full context needed for generating high-quality and informative commit
messages. In this paper, we propose a contextual code retrieval-based method
called C3Gen to enhance CMG by retrieving commit-relevant code snippets from
the repository and incorporating them into the model input to provide richer
contextual information at the repository scope. In the experiments, we
evaluated the effectiveness of C3Gen across various models using four objective
and three subjective metrics. Meanwhile, we design and conduct a human
evaluation to investigate how C3Gen-generated commit messages are perceived by
human developers. The results show that by incorporating contextual code into
the input, C3Gen enables models to effectively leverage additional information
to generate more comprehensive and informative commit messages with greater
practical value in real-world development scenarios. Further analysis
underscores concerns about the reliability of similaritybased metrics and
provides empirical insights for CMG.

TL;DR: The paper examines the connection between code issues (e.g., code smells) and learning challenges in object-oriented programming, proposing a conceptual map to address these educational difficulties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-oriented programming concepts are challenging for students, and addressing code-related issues can potentially aid in developing better educational resources.

Method: Qualitative analysis was used to categorize learning difficulties, combined with a literature review linking these challenges to code smell indicators and SOLID principle violations.

Result: A conceptual map was developed to link code-related issues with learning difficulties. It was evaluated by an expert for relevance and applicability to student code analysis.

Conclusion: The study provides a useful model for understanding and addressing learning challenges in object-oriented programming, with potential applicability in educational contexts.

Abstract: Object-Oriented programming is frequently challenging for undergraduate
Computer Science students, particularly in understanding abstract concepts such
as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Although the literature
outlines various methods to identify potential design and coding issues in
object-oriented programming through source code analysis, such as code smells
and SOLID principles, few studies explore how these code-level issues relate to
learning difficulties in Object-Oriented Programming. In this study, we explore
the relationship of the code issue indicators with common challenges
encountered during the learning of object-oriented programming. Using
qualitative analysis, we identified the main categories of learning
difficulties and, through a literature review, established connections between
these difficulties, code smells, and violations of the SOLID principles. As a
result, we developed a conceptual map that links code-related issues to
specific learning challenges in Object-Oriented Programming. The model was then
evaluated by an expert who applied it in the analysis of the student code to
assess its relevance and applicability in educational contexts.

TL;DR: The study used forecasting from 22 biostasis experts, revealing consensus on biomarkers and highlighting challenges in preservation and revival methods, with brain emulation viewed as most feasible for revival.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved questions in biostasis, such as reliable biomarkers, technical barriers, and feasibility of revival methods.

Method: Collaborative forecasting exercise involving 22 experts from neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care with expertise in biostasis.

Result: Findings include agreement that synaptic connectivity is a reliable biomarker, three preservation failure modes, skepticism about near-term revival, and differing views on revival methods like brain emulation and nanotechnology.

Conclusion: Experts' input identifies barriers, research priorities, and estimates on preservation quality and revival challenges, offering a roadmap for advancing biostasis.

Abstract: Biostasis has the potential to extend human lives by offering a bridge to
powerful life extension technologies that may be developed in the future.
However, key questions in the field remain unresolved, including which
biomarkers reliably indicate successful preservation, what technical obstacles
pose the greatest barriers, and whether different proposed revival methods are
theoretically feasible. To address these gaps, we conducted a collaborative
forecasting exercise with 22 practitioners in biostasis, including individuals
with expertise in neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care. Our results
reveal substantial consensus in some areas, for example that synaptic
connectivity can serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for information
preservation quality. Practitioners identified three most likely failure modes
in contemporary biostasis: inadequate preservation quality even under ideal
conditions, geographic barriers preventing timely preservation, and poor
procedural execution. Regarding revival strategies, most respondents believe
that provably reversible cryopreservation of whole mammalian organisms is most
likely decades away, with provably reversible human cryopreservation expected
even later, if it is ever achieved. Among revival strategies from contemporary
preservation methods, whole brain emulation was considered the most likely to
be developed first, though respondents were divided on the metaphysical
question of whether it could constitute genuine revival. Molecular
nanotechnology was viewed as nearly as likely to be technically feasible, and
compatible with both pure cryopreservation and aldehyde-based methods. Taken
together, these findings delineate current barriers to high-quality
preservation, identify future research priorities, and provide baseline
estimates for key areas of uncertainty.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting (ABCD) algorithm for automatic detection of faulty EEG channels, achieving significant accuracy improvements in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent issue of noise compromising EEG signal quality in BCI systems, particularly caused by non-biological artifacts.

Method: The paper employs the ABCD algorithm, which uses blink propagation patterns to identify and eliminate faulty EEG channels. It also leverages SNR topographies, source localization plots, and compares classification accuracy results of motor imagery data.

Result: The ABCD algorithm achieves an average classification accuracy of 93.81%, outperforming traditional approaches like ICA (79.29%) and ASR (84.05%) across 31 subjects and 63 sessions.

Conclusion: Using blink patterns to detect and exclude problematic EEG channels proves effective for improving BCI systems, enhancing real-time or offline signal quality by reducing noise.

Abstract: In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, noise presents a persistent
challenge, often compromising the quality of EEG signals essential for accurate
data interpretation. This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for
achieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address
the issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by
non-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line
interference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of
problematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting
(ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify
channels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR
topographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the
impact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery
(MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm,
reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%]
(confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions),
significantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction
(ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]). These results underscore the critical role of
channel selection and the potential of using blink patterns for detecting bad
EEG channels, offering valuable insights for improving real-time or offline BCI
systems by reducing noise and enhancing signal quality.

*Mohammad Reza Rahmani,Mohammad Hossein Yassaee,Mohammad Reza Aref*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the theoretical limits of covariance matrix estimation in a distributed setting, introducing a novel Conditional Strong Data Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) to analyze communication and error trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and accurate estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices is crucial in various domains, especially under distributed settings with communication constraints.

Method: The authors use the C-SDPI coefficient, along with mathematical tools like the doubling trick and operator Jensen inequality, to formulate lower bounds and protocols for distributed covariance estimation.

Result: They establish minimax lower bounds for estimation error using communication-constrained protocols and demonstrate an almost optimal protocol that is broadly applicable. They also show interaction in protocols reduces communication requirements significantly.

Conclusion: The study highlights both theoretical insights and practical methods for covariance estimation under constraints, contributing to broader applicability and efficiency in distributed data analysis protocols.

Abstract: Estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices is a key task across many
fields. This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance
estimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is
constrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each
observe different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random
vector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using
a limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight
minimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and
Frobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong
data processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data
Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI
coefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional
SDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent
channel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient
over the state input.
  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality,
we compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to
establish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs
among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on
this, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and
communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.
Unlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite
samples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we
extend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can
significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive
schemes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian model-based approach to assist decision-makers in selecting preferred solutions from a Pareto set in multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-makers often struggle to efficiently choose preferred solutions from the large Pareto set in multi-objective optimization problems.

Method: The paper employs a Bayesian model for estimating the decision-maker’s utility function through pairwise comparisons, integrated with a principled elicitation strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: The proposed method finds high-utility solutions with fewer queries, demonstrating effectiveness through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives.

Conclusion: This interactive or a posteriori approach simplifies the decision-making process by generating a reduced menu of solutions, and its open-source implementation promotes community adoption.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify
preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization
problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's
utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a
principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance
exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions.
The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after
estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization
techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a
reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making
process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our
method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with
a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our
method to support its adoption by the broader community.

### [283] [The surprising strength of weak classifiers for validating neural posterior estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17026)
*Vansh Bansal,Tianyu Chen,James G. Scott*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the problem of validating neural posterior estimates from Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and proposes a conformal variant of the classifier two-sample test (C2ST) that improves test performance, even for weak classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the accuracy of neural posterior estimates from NPE is challenging, as existing methods have shortcomings. The widely used classifier two-sample test (C2ST) requires a near-optimal classifier to be reliable, which is often infeasible in practice.

Method: The paper introduces a conformal variant of C2ST that leverages classifier scores (even from weak or overfitted classifiers) to calculate exact finite-sample p-values. Theoretical analysis ensures finite-sample Type-I error control and controlled degradation of power with classifier error.

Result: The conformal C2ST demonstrates superior empirical performance over classical discriminative tests across various benchmarks, proving its robustness and reliability.

Conclusion: The conformal C2ST establishes itself as a practical and theoretically justified tool for evaluating neural posterior estimates, even when using weak classifiers, highlighting their underappreciated potential in Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) has emerged as a powerful approach for
amortized Bayesian inference when the true posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ is
intractable or difficult to sample. But evaluating the accuracy of neural
posterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from
major limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier
two-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples
from the true posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation
$q(\theta \mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its
theoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a
near-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,
difficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still
be useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.
Building on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a
conformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores
-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample
p-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:
(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that
degrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot
is that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and
reliable tests. Empirically, the Conformal C2ST outperforms classical
discriminative tests across a wide range of benchmarks. These results reveal
the under appreciated strength of weak classifiers for validating neural
posterior estimates, establishing the conformal C2ST as a practical,
theoretically grounded diagnostic for modern simulation-based inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating neural posterior estimates are insufficient due to reliance on classifier-based tests or divergence measures, which face practical limitations.

Method: CoLT employs a localization function to adaptively identify areas where discrepancies between the true posterior and the neural posterior are the largest without relying on exhaustive comparisons, leveraging simulation-based inference settings.

Result: CoLT outperforms existing methods in accurately detecting discrepancies between the true posterior and neural posterior estimates, offering rigorous guarantees and pinpointing problematic regions.

Conclusion: CoLT is presented as a practical, scalable, and theoretically robust method that enhances the validation of neural posterior estimates, making it a state-of-the-art approach for this purpose.

Abstract: We consider the problem of validating whether a neural posterior estimate \(
q(\theta \mid x) \) is an accurate approximation to the true, unknown true
posterior \( p(\theta \mid x) \). Existing methods for evaluating the quality
of an NPE estimate are largely derived from classifier-based tests or
divergence measures, but these suffer from several practical drawbacks. As an
alternative, we introduce the \emph{Conditional Localization Test} (CoLT), a
principled method designed to detect discrepancies between \( p(\theta \mid x)
\) and \( q(\theta \mid x) \) across the full range of conditioning inputs.
Rather than relying on exhaustive comparisons or density estimation at every \(
x \), CoLT learns a localization function that adaptively selects points
$\theta_l(x)$ where the neural posterior $q$ deviates most strongly from the
true posterior $p$ for that $x$. This approach is particularly advantageous in
typical simulation-based inference settings, where only a single draw \( \theta
\sim p(\theta \mid x) \) from the true posterior is observed for each
conditioning input, but where the neural posterior \( q(\theta \mid x) \) can
be sampled an arbitrary number of times. Our theoretical results establish
necessary and sufficient conditions for assessing distributional equality
across all \( x \), offering both rigorous guarantees and practical
scalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoLT not only performs better
than existing methods at comparing $p$ and $q$, but also pinpoints regions of
significant divergence, providing actionable insights for model refinement.
These properties position CoLT as a state-of-the-art solution for validating
neural posterior estimates.

*Dirk van der Hoeven,Julia Olkhovskaia,Tim van Erven*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of estimating a discrete distribution in KL divergence with probabilistic bounds. It proves lower bounds for all estimators and introduces an efficient estimator achieving near-optimal bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the estimation of discrete distributions in KL divergence and provide high-probability performance guarantees.

Method: Analyzed KL divergence bounds theoretically, and introduced a novel estimator using Online to Batch conversion and suffix averaging. Also examined the maximum likelihood estimator for this problem.

Result: Derived worst-case lower bounds on estimation accuracy, established the performance of a new efficient estimator, and showed guarantees for the maximum likelihood estimator with large sample sizes.

Conclusion: The introduced estimator achieves near-optimal performance in KL divergence, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for estimating discrete distributions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a discrete distribution $p$ with
support of size $K$ and provide both upper and lower bounds with high
probability in KL divergence. We prove that in the worst case, for any
estimator $\widehat{p}$, with probability at least $\delta$, $\text{KL}(p \|
\widehat{p}) \geq C\max\{K,\ln(K)\ln(1/\delta) \}/n $, where $n$ is the sample
size and $C > 0$ is a constant. We introduce a computationally efficient
estimator $p^{\text{OTB}}$, based on Online to Batch conversion and suffix
averaging, and show that with probability at least $1 - \delta$ $\text{KL}(p \|
\widehat{p}) \leq C(K\log(\log(K)) + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)) /n$.
  Furthermore, we also show that with sufficiently many observations relative
to $\log(1/\delta)$, the maximum likelihood estimator $\bar{p}$ guarantees that
with probability at least $1-\delta$ $$
  1/6 \chi^2(\bar{p}\|p) \leq 1/4 \chi^2(p\|\bar{p}) \leq \text{KL}(p|\bar{p})
\leq C(K + \log(1/\delta))/n\,, $$ where $\chi^2$ denotes the

*Rashika Raina,Nidhi Simmons,David E. Simmons,Michel Daoud Yacoub,Trung Q. Duong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the calibration of machine learning models for outage prediction in resource allocation systems, analyzing theoretical properties and providing simulation-based validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need for accurate and well-calibrated predictions in next-generation communication systems where machine learning models help achieve reliability targets.

Method: Theoretical derivations establish properties of outage probability and its calibration conditions, complemented by simulations using calibration techniques like Platt scaling and isotonic regression.

Result: Findings highlight the limits and behaviors of perfectly calibrated ML predictors, such as their inability to improve minimum achievable outage probability through post-processing calibration.

Conclusion: Calibration guides threshold choice for desired outage probability. Well-calibrated models form part of predictors that improve outage probability performance while adhering to a monotonicity accuracy-confidence condition.

Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models
are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated
confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This
paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor
within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish
key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under
perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources
grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected
output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,
when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall
expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated
predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to
achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability
requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot
improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new
information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that
well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that
necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition
that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to
occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous
simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt
scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is
trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.
Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with
temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver
mobility.

TL;DR: The paper develops a new differentially private kernel ERM algorithm using random projection and achieves optimal privacy and utility balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to improve privacy-preserving learning algorithms, focusing on kernel methods within the ERM framework.

Method: They introduced random projection in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and derived dimension-free generalization bounds.

Result: Their method achieves minimax-optimal excess risk and outperforms existing dimension reduction techniques like random Fourier features.

Conclusion: Random projection is effective for balancing privacy and utility, suggesting its importance in designing privacy-oriented algorithms.

Abstract: Differential privacy has become a cornerstone in the development of
privacy-preserving learning algorithms. This work addresses optimizing
differentially private kernel learning within the empirical risk minimization
(ERM) framework. We propose a novel differentially private kernel ERM algorithm
based on random projection in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space using
Gaussian processes. Our method achieves minimax-optimal excess risk for both
the squared loss and Lipschitz-smooth convex loss functions under a local
strong convexity condition. We further show that existing approaches based on
alternative dimension reduction techniques, such as random Fourier feature
mappings or $\ell_2$ regularization, yield suboptimal generalization
performance. Our key theoretical contribution also includes the derivation of
dimension-free generalization bounds for objective perturbation-based private
linear ERM -- marking the first such result that does not rely on noisy
gradient-based mechanisms. Additionally, we obtain sharper generalization
bounds for existing differentially private kernel ERM algorithms. Empirical
evaluations support our theoretical claims, demonstrating that random
projection enables statistically efficient and optimally private kernel
learning. These findings provide new insights into the design of differentially
private algorithms and highlight the central role of dimension reduction in
balancing privacy and utility.

### [288] [Debiased maximum-likelihood estimators for hazard ratios under machine-learning adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17686)
*Takashi Hayakawa,Satoshi Asai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper tackles the limitations of hazard ratios from Cox models in observational data and proposes a machine learning framework that improves causal interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods using Cox models have difficulty interpreting hazard ratios due to baseline hazard issues and uncontrolled observational data dynamics.

Method: The authors use machine learning to model risk set changes with or without latent variables and apply Neyman orthogonality for debiased maximum-likelihood estimation.

Result: The proposed method identifies causal hazard ratios with minimal bias and offers computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This novel framework advances causal inference in epidemiology where uncontrolled, observational data prevail.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that hazard ratios between treatment groups
estimated with the Cox model are uninterpretable because the indefinite
baseline hazard of the model fails to identify temporal change in the risk set
composition due to treatment assignment and unobserved factors among multiple,
contradictory scenarios. To alleviate this problem, especially in studies based
on observational data with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time
measurement of many covariates, we propose abandoning the baseline hazard and
using machine learning to explicitly model the change in the risk set with or
without latent variables. For this framework, we clarify the context in which
hazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on
Neyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of
hazard ratios. Computing the constructed estimators is more efficient than
computing those based on weighted regression with marginal structural Cox
models. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method identifies the
ground truth with minimal bias. These results lay the foundation for developing
a useful, alternative method for causal inference with uncontrolled,
observational data in modern epidemiology.

### [289] [Sequential Bayesian Design for Efficient Surrogate Construction in the Inversion of Darcy Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17713)
*Hongji Wang,Hongqiao Wang,Jinyong Ying,Qingping Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes SBD-LAS, a method to efficiently solve inverse problems involving PDEs like Darcy flow equation by using locally accurate surrogates and a sequential Bayesian design strategy, achieving better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems governed by PDEs are computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems like those modeled by the Darcy flow equation. Traditional methods require numerous evaluations of forward solvers, making them resource-intensive and slow. A more efficient, accurate approach is needed.

Method: The researchers propose a locally accurate surrogate model focused on high-probability regions of the true likelihood, in order to solve PDEs' inverse problems. Instead of using globally accurate models requiring vast amounts of data, their approach demands lower computational complexity. They further employ a sequential Bayesian design strategy to guide the model, treating the posterior evolution process as a Gaussian process.

Result: The proposed SBD-LAS framework demonstrates improved inversion accuracy and faster computational performance in three experimental scenarios based on the Darcy flow equation.

Conclusion: By targeting high-probability regions and using a sequential Bayesian approach, the SBD-LAS framework enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of solving inverse problems in PDEs, making it a promising tool for applications in engineering and computational science.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) play a
crucial role in various fields, including computational science, image
processing, and engineering. Particularly, Darcy flow equation is a fundamental
equation in fluid mechanics, which plays a crucial role in understanding fluid
flow through porous media. Bayesian methods provide an effective approach for
solving PDEs inverse problems, while their numerical implementation requires
numerous evaluations of computationally expensive forward solvers. Therefore,
the adoption of surrogate models with lower computational costs is essential.
However, constructing a globally accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional
complex problems demands high model capacity and large amounts of data. To
address this challenge, this study proposes an efficient locally accurate
surrogate that focuses on the high-probability regions of the true likelihood
in inverse problems, with relatively low model complexity and few training data
requirements. Additionally, we introduce a sequential Bayesian design strategy
to acquire the proposed surrogate since the high-probability region of the
likelihood is unknown. The strategy treats the posterior evolution process of
sequential Bayesian design as a Gaussian process, enabling algorithmic
acceleration through one-step ahead prior. The complete algorithmic framework
is referred to as Sequential Bayesian design for locally accurate surrogate
(SBD-LAS). Finally, three experiments based the Darcy flow equation demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both inversion accuracy and
computational speed.

Motivation: The motivation is to create a machine learning-based method capable of efficiently predicting magnetic properties without relying on computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations.

Method: A graph-based framework is employed using graph neural networks followed by fully connected layers, trained on Monte Carlo simulation data to predict magnetization curves.

Result: The model successfully reproduces features of magnetization curves such as plateaus, critical points, and geometric frustration, leveraging both local and global structural information.

encoded as a graph and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) followed by
fully connected layers. The model is trained on Monte Carlo simulation data and
accurately reproduces key features of the magnetization curve, including
plateaus, critical transition points, and the effects of geometric frustration.
It captures both local motifs and global symmetries, demonstrating that GNNs
can infer magnetic behavior directly from structural connectivity. The proposed
approach enables efficient prediction of magnetization without the need for
additional Monte Carlo simulations.

Motivation: To leverage large atomic-resolution datasets with machine learning techniques for understanding physical phenomena within honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples.

Method: Machine learning models predict magnetic properties, while Variational Autoencoders are used to generate synthetic images and reduce segmentation errors. The methodology is divided into two stages for refined analysis.

Result: Machine learning models provide accurate predictions of magnetic moments/directions, identify frustrated vertices, and correlate structural-functional aspects of spin-ice configurations.

Conclusion: The approach enables automated analysis of spin-ice configurations and the design of optimized structures with controlled frustration patterns.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution
facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze
subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic
images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we
automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations
of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine
learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and
directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an
emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate
high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract
latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation
errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification
and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively
correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This
facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled
frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.

TL;DR: HuiduRep, a self-supervised framework, improves spike sorting in noisy and dynamic neural signals by learning robust features and outperforming existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in spike sorting caused by low SNR, electrode drift, and cross-session variability, which impair accurate brain activity decoding.

Method: Developed HuiduRep, a self-supervised representation learning framework combining contrastive learning and a denoising autoencoder to extract robust features, and integrated it into a clustering-based spike sorting pipeline.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show HuiduRep’s robustness and its ability to match or outperform leading tools like KiloSort4 and MountainSort5.

Conclusion: HuiduRep demonstrates self-supervised spike representation learning's effectiveness as a robust and generalizable approach for extracellular neural recording analysis.

Abstract: Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near
neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity
at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its
source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it
remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and
cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust
self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative
and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining
contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent
representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we
develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without
supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that
HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a
foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analytical methods for power and timing prediction rely on driver characterization and load simplifications, lacking precision for complex signal pathways. This paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging neural networks.

Method: The approach integrates two pre-trained neural models for waveform prediction and delay estimation, using a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture tailored to netlist-aware node encoding. Recursive propagation ensures multi-stage prediction accuracy.

Result: The framework achieves SPICE-level accuracy with RMSE below 0.0098 in diverse industrial circuits.

Conclusion: The neural framework provides a scalable and adaptable alternative to conventional power and timing prediction methods while maintaining fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of
multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based
analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load
simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard
cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform
prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and
propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical
parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method
accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without
requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,
we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from
each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across
the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete
waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction
utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level
encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality
constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary
delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate
SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse
industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally
adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines,
demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection and tracking of multiple targets in MIMO radar by overcoming inefficiencies from uniform power allocation.

Method: Extends a single-target planning algorithm to multi-target scenarios using POMCP trees for each target and adaptive waveform design via optimization.

Result: Simulations show enhanced detection and tracking performance, especially for low-SNR targets, compared to uniform power allocation approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive radar system demonstrates improved efficiency and effectiveness in multi-target scenarios, showcasing potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for
joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target
algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend
it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree,
enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with
varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's
future angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated
range and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform
design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to
enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring
sufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to
prioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the
effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar
improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate
tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These
results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive,
efficient multi-target radar systems.

Result: The model achieved 65.0% top-1 accuracy on the USPTO-50K benchmark, outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and delivered accurate multistep retrosynthetic routes. Human assessments validated the chemical plausibility of its predictions.

Conclusion: RetroDFM-R improves the reliability, explainability, and practical utility of retrosynthesis planning, establishing itself as a robust framework for both academic and real-world applications.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning, essential in organic synthesis and drug discovery,
has greatly benefited from recent AI-driven advancements. Nevertheless,
existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and
explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often
lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither
consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we
introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed
specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement
learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly
enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind
human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical
utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts
multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world
drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generic toolchain to port variational quantum algorithm definitions between simulators, and demonstrates its applicability using three quantum problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the complexity and error-prone process of comparing performance and results in variational quantum algorithms across different software simulators and environments, due to large parameter spaces.

Method: The researchers used a generic description of the problem—both Hamiltonian and ansatz—to consistently port problem definitions to different simulators, running three use case scenarios on HPC systems and software simulators.

Result: The toolchain successfully translated problem definitions across simulators, but performance was found limited by long runtimes relative to memory footprint, with restricted parallelism that was somewhat alleviated using job arrays.

Conclusion: The parser tool effectively explores performance in HPC contexts and facilitates result comparison for variational algorithm simulations, though scalability remains a challenge.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are of special importance in the research on
quantum computing applications because of their applicability to current Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The main building blocks of these
algorithms (among them, the definition of the Hamiltonian and of the ansatz,
the optimizer) define a relatively large parameter space, making the comparison
of results and performance between different approaches and software simulators
cumbersome and prone to errors. In this paper, we employ a generic description
of the problem, in terms of both Hamiltonian and ansatz, to port a problem
definition consistently among different simulators. Three use cases of
relevance for current quantum hardware (ground state calculation for the
Hydrogen molecule, MaxCut, Travelling Salesman Problem) have been run on a set
of HPC systems and software simulators to study the dependence of performance
on the runtime environment, the scalability of the simulation codes and the
mutual agreement of the physical results, respectively. The results show that
our toolchain can successfully translate a problem definition between different
simulators. On the other hand, variational algorithms are limited in their
scaling by the long runtimes with respect to their memory footprint, so they
expose limited parallelism to computation. This shortcoming is partially
mitigated by using techniques like job arrays. The potential of the parser tool
for exploring HPC performance and comparisons of results of variational
algorithm simulations is highlighted.

Motivation: The paper addresses noise as a fundamental challenge in quantum computing that hinders achieving quantum supremacy, and the need for accurate noise characterization to manage quantum systems efficiently.

Method: The QuBound framework utilizes historical performance decomposition to isolate noise sources, integrates a novel encoder for circuit and noise data, and employs an LSTM network to predict computational performance bounds.

Conclusion: QuBound provides an efficient and reliable tool for predicting performance bounds in quantum systems, paving the way for better system management and the realization of quantum advantages.

Abstract: Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting
devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential
quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses
significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact
is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the
next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient
and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job
scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of
jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional
objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum
device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is
vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and
scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely
QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical
performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to
embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art
learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value
instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing
approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our
QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds.
Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits
with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is
over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.

*Wei-You Liao,Yuxuan Du,Xinbiao Wang,Tian-Ci Tian,Yong Luo,Bo Du,Dacheng Tao,He-Liang Huang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces predictive surrogates as efficient classical models to emulate quantum processors, enabling reduced reliance on quantum hardware and broadening their applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum processors' high fabrication costs limit their availability and widespread application, necessitating a cost-effective solution for efficient utilization.

Method: The paper proposes predictive surrogates, classical learning models with provable efficiency, to emulate mean-value behavior of quantum processors; it demonstrates their utility with examples like variational quantum eigensolvers.

Result: Experiments on a simulated 20-qubit quantum processor show predictive surrogates drastically reduce measurement overhead and outperform conventional methods in some cases.

Conclusion: Predictive surrogates offer a scalable and practical means to amplify the utility of quantum processors, potentially expanding their real-world applications.

Abstract: The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in
scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating
large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable
future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we
introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning
models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor
with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two
predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum
processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential
in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a
quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling
efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of
transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet
symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the
predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of
magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,
quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish
predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of
advanced quantum processors.

*Die Hu,Shuyue Hu,Chunjiang Mu,Shiqi Fan,Chen Chu,Jinzhuo Liu,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The study analyzes how heterogeneity fades in large-scale multi-agent systems, with agents converging towards unified behavior through smooth regret-matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impacts of heterogeneity on equilibrium formation in large-scale multi-agent systems and achieve a theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning.

Method: The paper employs modeling of system states as probability distributions of regrets and analyzes their evolution using the continuity equation to study changes in agent behavior.

Result: The analysis shows that the variance of regret distribution diminishes over time, indicating a universal phenomenon where heterogeneity disappears and agents reach consensus.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate convergence to quantal response equilibria, advancing the understanding of equilibrium selection in diverse multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the behavior of large-scale multi-agents in
games remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper
examines the role of heterogeneity in equilibrium formation by analyzing how
smooth regret-matching drives a large number of heterogeneous agents with
diverse initial policies toward unified behavior. By modeling the system state
as a probability distribution of regrets and analyzing its evolution through
the continuity equation, we uncover a key phenomenon in diverse multi-agent
settings: the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, leading
to the disappearance of heterogeneity and the emergence of consensus among
agents. This universal result enables us to prove convergence to quantal
response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative multi-agent settings.
Our work advances the theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning and
offers a novel perspective on equilibrium selection in diverse game-theoretic
scenarios.

*Damiano Azzolini,Fabrizio Riguzzi,Theresa Swift*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new probabilistic logic programming framework using interval-based belief functions to address epistemic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to overcome the limitation of the Distribution Semantics relying on point-probabilities, making it hard to include epistemic uncertainty in reasoning systems.

Method: The authors propose Capacity Logic Programs that extend the Distribution Semantics using belief functions, which utilize interval probabilities.

Result: The newly proposed framework addresses epistemic uncertainty and retains practical applicability, supported by specific properties and examples.

Conclusion: This extension of the Distribution Semantics provides a useful and practical tool for reasoning under uncertainty, especially involving hierarchical and epistemic scenarios.

Abstract: Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the Distribution Semantics is a
leading approach to practical reasoning under uncertainty. An advantage of the
Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or
Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely
ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution
Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic
uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications
from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures
as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval
probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs
based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief
functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable
to practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems perform poorly on Jamaican Patois music, limiting accessibility and downstream applications.

Method: More than 40 hours of Jamaican Patois music were manually transcribed and used to fine-tune state-of-the-art ASR models, with performance scaling laws developed using Whisper models.

work, we take a data-centric approach to this problem by curating more than 40

*Xinwei Cao,Zijian Fan,Torbjørn Svendsen,Giampiero Salvi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces two innovative methods for phoneme-level pronunciation assessment in MDD systems—GOP-SA and GOP-AF—enabling usage of modern CTC-trained ASR models, improving accuracy and overcoming pre-segmentation constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improvement in phoneme-level pronunciation assessment for MDD systems using modern methodologies, while addressing the limitations of needing pre-segmented phonetic speech input for accuracy.

Method: Proposed self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) and a more general alignment-free method (GOP-AF) to utilize modern CTC-trained ASR models and account for all possible alignments. Addressed practical issues like numerical stability and normalization.

Result: Experiments on CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets showed that GOP-AF depends on acoustic model peakiness and phoneme context. GOP-AF-based feature vectors achieved state-of-the-art results on Speechocean762 for phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully utilize modern ASR models to overcome segmentation-related limitations in MDD systems, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in pronunciation evaluation.

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in
modern computer aided language learning (CALL) systems. Within MDD,
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve
their pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of
pronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic
units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use
modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first
propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR
models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes
all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a
theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves
potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the
method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We
provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762
datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the
dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount
of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with
recent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors
derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of different Voice-based AI architectures (STT, LLM, TTS) in large-scale job interviews, revealing strengths in specific configurations while noting weak correlations between objective quality and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill the gap in systematic evaluations of various STT x LLM x TTS configurations, as they are becoming increasingly prominent in AI systems yet lack standardized benchmarks, particularly in production environments.

Method: Using data from 300,000 job interviews conducted by AI, the authors developed an automated evaluation framework employing LLM-as-a-Judge to measure conversational quality, technical accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities within multimodal configurations.

Result: The study finds that Google STT coupled with GPT-4.1 delivers the best results in conversational and technical quality metrics. However, these metrics show weak correlation with user satisfaction, indicating that other factors influence user experience.

Conclusion: The paper suggests practical guidance for choosing components in multimodal AI systems and introduces a validated methodology for evaluating voice-based AI. It highlights a mismatch between technical quality and user satisfaction, requiring further exploration of user experience factors.

Abstract: Voice-based conversational AI systems increasingly rely on cascaded
architectures combining speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and
text-to-speech (TTS) components. However, systematic evaluation of different
component combinations in production settings remains understudied. We present
a large-scale empirical comparison of STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data from
over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. We develop an automated evaluation
framework using LLM-as-a-Judge to assess conversational quality, technical
accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities. Our analysis of four production
configurations reveals that Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 significantly
outperforms alternatives in both conversational and technical quality metrics.
Surprisingly, we find that objective quality metrics correlate weakly with user
satisfaction scores, suggesting that user experience in voice-based AI systems
depends on factors beyond technical performance. Our findings provide practical
guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversational AI systems and
contribute a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions.

*Peter Plantinga,Briac Cordelle,Dominique Louër,Mirco Ravanelli,Denise Klein*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The study evaluates various pretrained models to find effective methods for using speech samples as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is disagreement in the literature regarding the best methods to collect and analyze speech data for PD diagnosis.

Method: Pretrained models with different data types, pretraining objectives, and language features were tested for their effectiveness in PD detection.

Result: Text-only models perform as well as vocal-feature models, multilingual Whisper outperforms self-supervised models, and AudioSet pretraining shows selective benefits depending on speech type.

Conclusion: Language plays a critical role in using speech-based methods for early detection of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Using speech samples as a biomarker is a promising avenue for detecting and
monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is
considerable disagreement in the literature about how best to collect and
analyze such data. Early research in detecting PD from speech used a sustained
vowel phonation (SVP) task, while some recent research has explored recordings
of more cognitively demanding tasks. To assess the role of language in PD
detection, we tested pretrained models with varying data types and pretraining
objectives and found that (1) text-only models match the performance of
vocal-feature models, (2) multilingual Whisper outperforms self-supervised
models whereas monolingual Whisper does worse, and (3) AudioSet pretraining
improves performance on SVP but not spontaneous speech. These findings together
highlight the critical role of language for the early detection of Parkinson's
disease.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The study applies sparse autoencoders to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) from speech by uncovering interpretable internal representations, emphasizing clinically relevant biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for Parkinson's detection are effective but lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with novel mask-based activation were used to analyze small biomedical datasets, extracting dictionary representations linked to PD speech characteristics.

Result: The method identified associations between PD speech deficits and spectral markers, and correlated spectral flux with MRI-based volumetric measurements of the putamen.

Conclusion: SAEs can uncover interpretable and clinically relevant biomarkers, advancing speech-based approaches for neurological disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Speech holds promise as a cost-effective and non-invasive biomarker for
neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). While deep learning
systems trained on raw audio can find subtle signals not available from
hand-crafted features, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption. To
address this, we apply sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to uncover interpretable
internal representations from a speech-based PD detection system. We introduce
a novel mask-based activation for adapting SAEs to small biomedical datasets,
creating sparse disentangled dictionary representations. These dictionary
entries are found to have strong associations with characteristic articulatory
deficits in PD speech, such as reduced spectral flux and increased spectral
flatness in the low-energy regions highlighted by the model attention. We
further show that the spectral flux is related to volumetric measurements of
the putamen from MRI scans, demonstrating the potential of SAEs to reveal
clinically relevant biomarkers for disease monitoring and diagnosis.

*Isha Pandey,Pranav Gaikwad,Amruta Parulekar,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper addresses high-quality speech generation challenges in low-resource Indian languages and evaluates various duration prediction strategies in speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of limited data and diverse linguistic structures in low-resource languages, especially Indian languages, prompts the need for improved speech generation methods.

Method: The authors use a non-autoregressive Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) speech model with different duration prediction strategies and evaluate these strategies using publicly available Indian language data for tasks like zero-shot generation.

Result: The study shows that different duration predictors have trade-offs: infilling predictors enhance intelligibility for some languages, while speaker-prompted predictors retain speaker characteristics better in others.

Conclusion: Duration prediction remains valuable for adapting speech generation architectures in low-resource, multilingual contexts, and selecting appropriate strategies is crucial for specific languages and tasks.

Abstract: High-quality speech generation for low-resource languages, such as many
Indian languages, remains a significant challenge due to limited data and
diverse linguistic structures. Duration prediction is a critical component in
many speech generation pipelines, playing a key role in modeling prosody and
speech rhythm. While some recent generative approaches choose to omit explicit
duration modeling, often at the cost of longer training times. We retain and
explore this module to better understand its impact in the linguistically rich
and data-scarce landscape of India. We train a non-autoregressive Continuous
Normalizing Flow (CNF) based speech model using publicly available Indian
language data and evaluate multiple duration prediction strategies for
zero-shot, speaker-specific generation. Our comparative analysis on
speech-infilling tasks reveals nuanced trade-offs: infilling based predictors
improve intelligibility in some languages, while speaker-prompted predictors
better preserve speaker characteristics in others. These findings inform the
design and selection of duration strategies tailored to specific languages and
tasks, underscoring the continued value of interpretable components like
duration prediction in adapting advanced generative architectures to
low-resource, multilingual settings.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHNS, a clustering-based method for sampling hard negatives in supervised contrastive learning for speaker verification, achieving significant improvements over baseline and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classification-based methods for speaker verification face limitations, and contrastive learning shows promise particularly by leveraging similar but different-class samples (hard negatives). An effective way to exploit hard negatives is needed.

Method: The method, CHNS, is based on clustering embeddings of similar speakers to create an optimal balance of hard and easy negatives in contrastive learning. This approach adjusts the batch composition dynamically to enhance training efficacy.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the VoxCeleb dataset with lightweight models shows CHNS outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art approaches by up to 18% in relative EER and minDCF.

Conclusion: CHNS enhances speaker verification performance by effectively leveraging hard negatives, providing a significant improvement over traditional contrastive and classification-based approaches.

Abstract: In speaker verification, contrastive learning is gaining popularity as an
alternative to the traditionally used classification-based approaches.
Contrastive methods can benefit from an effective use of hard negative pairs,
which are different-class samples particularly challenging for a verification
model due to their similarity. In this paper, we propose CHNS - a
clustering-based hard negative sampling method, dedicated for supervised
contrastive speaker representation learning. Our approach clusters embeddings
of similar speakers, and adjusts batch composition to obtain an optimal ratio
of hard and easy negatives during contrastive loss calculation. Experimental
evaluation shows that CHNS outperforms a baseline supervised contrastive
approach with and without loss-based hard negative sampling, as well as a
state-of-the-art classification-based approach to speaker verification by as
much as 18 % relative EER and minDCF on the VoxCeleb dataset using two
lightweight model architectures.

TL;DR: Modern speech technologies often overlook implicit and contextual aspects of communication, so this paper introduces a structured framework and the concept of Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS) to improve speech intelligence and interaction systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech technologies like ASR and TTS are insufficient in capturing implicit signals and contextual cues critical to human communication.

Method: The paper introduces Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5) to represent the evolution of dialogue systems. It proposes the BoSS framework, utilizing cognitive theories and machine learning, to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics.

Result: The study evaluates BoSS-related attributes across five dimensions and finds current spoken language models (SLMs) struggle to interpret beyond-semantic signals effectively.

Conclusion: Advancing research in BoSS is essential to enable more context-aware and human-like communications in machine interfaces.

Abstract: Human communication involves more than explicit semantics, with implicit
signals and contextual cues playing a critical role in shaping meaning.
However, modern speech technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and Text-to-Speech (TTS) often fail to capture these beyond-semantic
dimensions. To better characterize and benchmark the progression of speech
intelligence, we introduce Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5),
a hierarchical framework illustrated the evolution of spoken dialogue systems
from basic command recognition to human-like social interaction. To support
these advanced capabilities, we propose Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS), which
refers to the set of information in speech communication that encompasses but
transcends explicit semantics. It conveys emotions, contexts, and modifies or
extends meanings through multidimensional features such as affective cues,
contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics, thereby enhancing the
understanding of communicative intentions and scenarios. We present a
formalized framework for BoSS, leveraging cognitive relevance theories and
machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics. We
evaluate BoSS-related attributes across five different dimensions, reveals that
current spoken language models (SLMs) are hard to fully interpret
beyond-semantic signals. These findings highlight the need for advancing BoSS
research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for Spatial Semantic Segmentation of sound scenes (S5), improving the synergy between sound event detection and source separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes lack fine-grained temporal information, limiting effective separation of audio sources.

Method: The paper proposes fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer for sound class detection, using another instance for detailed sound detection to guide separation, and implementing an iterative refinement process for progressive improvement.

Result: The approach achieves significant improvements in audio tagging and source separation, securing second place in the DCASE Challenge 2025 Task 4.

Conclusion: The proposed advancements successfully enhance the ability to segment and separate complex acoustic mixtures, with implementation details shared publicly on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate
identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their
sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a
two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source
separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal
information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy
between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions
are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active
sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned
Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation
module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by
recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These
advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source
separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in
Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints
are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve speech analysis for clinical applications by using articulatory-phonological features to enhance diagnosis and therapy.

Method: Developed a multimodal deep learning model that integrates real-time MRI (rtMRI) and speech signals. Evaluated four configurations: rtMRI only, audio only, middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based fusion.

Result: The contrastive learning-based fusion achieves an average F1-score of 0.81, showing a significant performance improvement over unimodal approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework confirms the effectiveness of contrastive representation learning in multimodal articulatory phonological analysis and improves robustness in speech technologies.

Abstract: Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features plays a vital
role in understanding human speech production and developing robust speech
technologies, particularly in clinical contexts where targeted phonemic
analysis and therapy can improve disease diagnosis accuracy and personalized
rehabilitation. In this work, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework
that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals
to classify three key articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of
articulation, and voicing. We perform classification on 15 phonological classes
derived from the aforementioned articulatory dimensions and evaluate the system
with four audio/vision configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio signals,
multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion.
Experimental results on the USC-TIMIT dataset show that our contrastive
learning-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average
F1-score of 0.81, representing an absolute increase of 0.23 over the unimodal
baseline. The results confirm the effectiveness of contrastive representation
learning for multimodal articulatory analysis. Our code and processed dataset

Result: The authors demonstrate the MPC platform's application to a Bayesian neural network performing inference in a CIFAR-10 classification task, achieving seven orders of magnitude improvement in metrics including energy efficiency, area consumption, and speed compared to standard 28nm CMOS implementations.

Conclusion: The MPC platform represents a promising advance in physical AI, paving the way for reliable, energy-efficient, and uncertainty-aware computation.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring
reliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks
offer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without
inherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical
domains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have
emerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty
quantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed
for deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This
poses a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic
processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this
challenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an
energy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic
magnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven
strategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and
their dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing
for AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW
stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic
functionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we
implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its
functionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS
implementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement
in the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,
energy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's
potential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems.

### [315] [Analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptography in User Equipment in 5G and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17074)
*Sanzida Hoque,Abdullah Aydeger,Engin Zeydan,Madhusanka Liyanage*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms in 5G communication environments, highlighting efficiency and overhead differences among specific algorithm combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic systems, necessitating the shift to PQC to secure critical communication systems like 5G networks.

Method: Implemented PQC algorithms in 5G networks using a full emulation stack and evaluated metrics such as latency, computational overhead, and real-world network performance.

Result: ML-KEM and ML-DSA provide optimal efficiency for latency-sensitive tasks, while SPHINCS+ and HQC combinations impose higher computational and transmission costs.

Conclusion: Efficient PQC integration in 5G is feasible, but careful selection of algorithms is required based on application-specific requirements like latency and security.

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of classical
public-key cryptographic systems, prompting the transition to post-quantum
cryptography (PQC). While PQC has been analyzed in theory, its performance in
practical wireless communication environments remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed implementation and performance evaluation of NIST-selected
PQC algorithms in user equipment (UE) to UE communications over 5G networks.
Using a full 5G emulation stack (Open5GS and UERANSIM) and PQC-enabled TLS 1.3
via BoringSSL and liboqs, we examine key encapsulation mechanisms and digital
signature schemes across realistic network conditions. We evaluate performance
based on handshake latency, CPU and memory usage, bandwidth, and retransmission
rates, under varying cryptographic configurations and client loads. Our
findings show that ML-KEM with ML-DSA offers the best efficiency for
latency-sensitive applications, while SPHINCS+ and HQC combinations incur
higher computational and transmission overheads, making them unsuitable for
security-critical but time-sensitive 5G scenarios.

*Radowanul Haque,Aftab Ali,Sally McClean,Naveed Khan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ExplainVulD uses graph-based techniques and dual-channel embeddings to improve vulnerability detection in C/C++ code, while addressing class imbalance and providing explainable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming challenges in detecting security vulnerabilities, such as class imbalance in datasets, high false positive rates, and lack of explainability in existing methods.

Method: ExplainVulD constructs Code Property Graphs, uses dual-channel embeddings for semantic and structural information, employs an edge-aware attention mechanism, and applies a class-weighted cross-entropy loss for training.

Result: ExplainVulD achieves 88.25% accuracy and a 48.23% F1 score on the ReVeal dataset, showing significant improvements over both the ReVeal model and static analysis tools.

Conclusion: ExplainVulD not only enhances vulnerability detection performance but also offers explainable outputs, aiding transparency and trust in security workflows.

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging,
particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable
functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise
for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in
development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability,
limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents
ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code.
The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using
dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information.
These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates
edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class
imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss.
ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23
percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results
represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in
F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The
framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0
to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond
improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by
identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting
transparency and trust in security triage.

### [317] [Revisiting Pre-trained Language Models for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16887)
*Youpeng Li,Weiliang Qi,Xuyu Wang,Fuxun Yu,Xinda Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines 17 pre-trained language models (PLMs) for vulnerability detection (VD) using new datasets and evaluates their performance under different setups and perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in assessing the effectiveness of PLMs for detecting real-world software vulnerabilities and improve evaluation setups for VD tasks.

Method: Evaluated 17 PLMs using new datasets under fine-tuning and prompt engineering, analyzing robustness against code transformations and different training-testing configurations.

Result: PLMs with syntactic and semantic pre-training tasks performed better for VD, but face challenges in real-world scenarios, including handling code perturbations and limited context windows.

Conclusion: Thorough evaluations of PLMs are necessary for realistic VD applications, and future efforts should aim to address current challenges for improved practical utilization.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated
promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness
in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the
security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for
vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data
preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the
accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD,
an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and
large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the
performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their
effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing
settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction,
and semantic-preserving transformations.
  Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks
designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both
general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code
corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios,
such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies,
handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and
identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the
truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a
non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance
of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and
outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for
realistic VD applications.

Motivation: To address the need for more practical and interactive frameworks in cybersecurity education that bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.

Method: Integrating Digital Twins with a custom penetration testing toolkit called Red Team Knife (RTK) and Large Language Models to simulate realistic cyber environments and provide enhanced training support.

Result: Initial findings indicate that the combined DT and LLM framework significantly enhances cybersecurity training effectiveness and relevance.

Conclusion: This research shows that integrating DTs and LLMs in cybersecurity education can revolutionize training, making it more aligned with industry demands and enabling hands-on learning experiences in threat analysis and defense.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability
to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology),
and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time
monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how
integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating
realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive
framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core
of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing
toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide
learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance,
exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of
Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing
intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and
adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM
framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on
skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations.
Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the
effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between
theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research
demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to
meet evolving industry demands.

*Shams Shaikh,Trima P. Fernandes e Fizardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reviews the vulnerabilities of HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments and explores alternative methods like confidential computing for enhancing cryptographic trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address growing concerns about the security of cryptographic key management in cloud environments given incidents of breaches and systemic vulnerabilities.

Method: Analyzed notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identified common attack vectors, and evaluated new models like confidential computing and decentralized key management.

Result: Findings reveal that HSMs and TPMs are challenged in cloud-native settings and call for adaptive and layered security architectures.

Conclusion: While HSMs and TPMs still contribute to security, modern cloud ecosystems need alternative and layered approaches to ensure robust cryptographic trust.

Abstract: As organizations rapidly migrate to the cloud, the security of cryptographic
key management has become a growing concern. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard
for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by
cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud
deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations,
allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections.
These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding
cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes
notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack
vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in
distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as
confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key
management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role,
modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By
evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips
cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce
cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape.

### [320] [CASPER: Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi Scheme Detecter with More Negative Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16840)
*Weijia Yang,Tian Lan,Leyuan Liu,Wei Chen,Tianqing Zhu,Sheng Wen,Xiaosong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes CASPER, a framework utilizing contrastive learning to detect smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain transactions, achieving improved performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain pose significant fraud risks, and current detection relies heavily on supervised methods requiring extensive labeled data, which is scarce.

Method: CASPER employs a contrastive learning framework to create effective representations of smart contract code using mostly unlabeled datasets, reducing data dependency and operational costs.

Result: CASPER outperformed baseline methods significantly, achieving a 20% improvement in F1 score with 25% labeled data in blockchain fraud detection experiments.

Conclusion: CASPER demonstrated the potential for scalable and cost-efficient fraud detection, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in identifying smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital currency trading, fueled by the integration of
blockchain technology, has led to both innovation and the emergence of smart
Ponzi schemes. A smart Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation in
smart contract that uses funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier
investors. Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning
typically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of
labeled data. However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model
training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning
framework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more
negative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in
blockchain transactions. By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER
can learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using
unlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system
complexity. We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the
baseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. More
impressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly
20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions. These
results highlight CASPER's potential for effective and cost-efficient detection
of smart Ponzi schemes, paving the way for scalable fraud detection solutions
in the future.

*Álvaro Ruiz-Ródenas,Jaime Pujante Sáez,Daniel García-Algora,Mario Rodríguez Béjar,Jorge Blasco,José Luis Hernández-Ramos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SynthCTI is a data augmentation framework enhancing threat intelligence tasks by generating synthetic CTI sentences, addressing challenges like class imbalance and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges faced by automated CTI mining processes, especially the lack of high-quality labeled data and class imbalance.

Method: SynthCTI employs a clustering-based strategy to extract semantic contexts and uses LLMs to generate synthetic CTI sentences, balancing lexical diversity and semantic fidelity.

Result: SynthCTI improves performance on publicly available CTI datasets, achieving significant macro-F1 score gains—for instance, ALBERT's score improved by 48.6%.

Conclusion: SynthCTI effectively mitigates data limitations in CTI classification tasks, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones without augmentation, thus underlining its utility.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining involves extracting structured
insights from unstructured threat data, enabling organizations to understand
and respond to evolving adversarial behavior. A key task in CTI mining is
mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. However, this process
is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and substantial effort.
Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality
labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few
examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT
have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture
rather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI,
a data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI
sentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. Our method uses a
clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and
guide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse
and semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI
datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity.
Incorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for
example, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\%), and
SecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412). Notably, smaller models augmented
with SynthCTI outperform larger models trained without augmentation,
demonstrating the value of data generation methods for building efficient and
effective CTI classification systems.

### [322] [Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259)
*Eyal German,Sagiv Antebi,Daniel Samira,Asaf Shabtai,Yuval Elovici*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset to evaluate membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) trained on tabular data. The study finds that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that make them highly vulnerable to MIAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aimed to address the privacy risks involved when large language models (LLMs) are trained on tabular data, which often contains sensitive and structured information. Existing MIA methods focus on text, but no systematic study existed for tabular data.

Method: The authors developed Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset, to conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs trained on tabular data. Data were encoded in six formats, and evaluations covered multiple configurations of fine-tuning.

Result: The study found that LLMs significantly memorize tabular data, with vulnerability levels influenced by encoding format. Results revealed high AUROC scores (approaching 90%) for MIA attacks, even with minimal fine-tuning (e.g., three epochs).

Conclusion: Findings underline the susceptibility of LLMs trained on tabular data to privacy attacks. The Tab-MIA dataset provides a systematic way to evaluate and develop privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs handling structured data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which,
unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information
(PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks
arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and
exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While
existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and
threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its
limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and
column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset
for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used.
Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different
encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation
of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across
multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization
behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables.
Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across
encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when
fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with
AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic
evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing
privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.

### [323] [CompLeak: Deep Learning Model Compression Exacerbates Privacy Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16872)
*Na Li,Yansong Gao,Hongsheng Hu,Boyu Kuang,Anmin Fu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CompLeak, a framework to assess privacy risks posed by model compression methods in deep learning, using membership inference attacks as a lens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that while model compression is essential for resource efficiency in deep learning, its impact on privacy risks has not been adequately studied or understood.

Method: The authors propose CompLeak, a privacy risk evaluation framework with three variants – CompLeakNR, CompLeakSR, and CompLeakMR – to assess leakage risks under various compression schemes such as pruning, quantization, and weight clustering.

Result: Experiments on seven different model architectures, including BERT and GPT-2, and six benchmark datasets demonstrate significant privacy risks associated with compressed models, highlighting variations in privacy vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study reveals that model compression amplifies privacy leakage risks and underscores the need to consider privacy evaluation in model compression practices.

Abstract: Model compression is crucial for minimizing memory storage and accelerating
inference in deep learning (DL) models, including recent foundation models like
large language models (LLMs). Users can access different compressed model
versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing
compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between
resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by
compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood.
  In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we
propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three
widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and
weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of
Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has
three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and
original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a
single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models
influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one
compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a
reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta
information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple
compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model,
CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed
versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct
extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to
foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark
datasets.

*Md Min-Ha-Zul Abedin,Tazqia Mehrub*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of static malware detection using various machine learning models and preprocessing techniques on the EMBER dataset. Boosting models like LightGBM and XGBoost show superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to identify effective machine learning approaches for static malware detection using feature-rich representations of Portable Executable files from the EMBER dataset.

Method: Eight classification models are evaluated under three preprocessing schemes (original, PCA, LDA) using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC, supported by exploratory data analysis methods like mutual information ranking and outlier detection.

Result: Boosting models (LightGBM, XGBoost) performed the best overall, showing minimal sensitivity to PCA and optimal generalization. LDA improved KNN but hindered ensemble models. TabNet underperformed under feature reduction.

Conclusion: Boosting models remain the most effective for high-dimensional static malware detection, and dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on the model type. Insights from this study offer benchmarks for system development and deployment.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning
algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains
feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight
classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees,
HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three
preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on
accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive
performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost,
show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal
sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance
but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising
in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural
sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed
exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or
t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local
Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features
in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most
reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that
dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type.
This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and
preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights
that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.

Abstract: In the era of synthetic media, deepfake manipulations pose a significant
threat to information integrity. To address this challenge, we propose

data. Our design addresses both the computational constraints of XR platforms
while adhering to the stringent privacy requirements in sensitive settings.
Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark deepfake datasets demonstrate
that TrustDefender achieves 95.3% detection accuracy, coupled with efficient
proof generation underpinned by rigorous cryptography, ensuring seamless
integration with high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By
fusing advanced computer vision models with provable security mechanisms, our
work establishes a foundation for reliable AI in immersive and

*April Herwig,Matthew J. Colbrook,Oliver Junge,Péter Koltai,Julia Slipantschuk*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper develops algorithms to compute the spectral properties of transfer operators free from spectral pollution, with broad applications like protein folding modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of spectral pollution in computing Koopman and transfer operators' spectral properties, and to provide provably accurate methods.

Method: Development of algorithms for transfer operators and extension to Hardy-Hilbert space, validated with case studies.

Result: Algorithms demonstrate high accuracy and flexibility in removing spectral pollution and analyzing diverse systems, even showcasing subtle spectral phenomena.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer reliable spectral estimation for transfer operators and reveal complexities in defining the Koopman spectrum.

Abstract: Koopman operator theory enables linear analysis of nonlinear dynamical
systems by lifting their evolution to infinite-dimensional function spaces.
However, finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman and transfer
(Frobenius--Perron) operators are prone to spectral pollution, introducing
spurious eigenvalues that can compromise spectral computations. While recent
advances have yielded provably convergent methods for Koopman operators,
analogous tools for general transfer operators remain limited. In this paper,
we present algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators
without spectral pollution, including extensions to the Hardy-Hilbert space.
Case studies--ranging from families of Blaschke maps with known spectrum to a
molecular dynamics model of protein folding--demonstrate the accuracy and
flexibility of our approach. Notably, we demonstrate that spectral features can
arise even when the corresponding eigenfunctions lie outside the chosen space,
highlighting the functional-analytic subtleties in defining the "true" Koopman
spectrum. Our methods offer robust tools for spectral estimation across a broad
range of applications.

*Lijie Zheng,Ji He,Shih Yu Chang,Yulong Shen,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses physical layer security by maximizing secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks while considering propulsion energy constraints using a two-layer optimization framework combining SDR and LLM-guided reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or ignore the trade-off between energy consumption and security in UAV networks.

Method: A hierarchical optimization framework consisting of a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for secrecy precoding in the inner layer and a Large Language Model-guided heuristic reinforcement learning approach for trajectory optimization in the outer layer.

Result: The proposed method improves both secrecy rate and energy efficiency, showing robustness across different UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances security and energy efficiency, addressing realistic constraints and outperforming existing methods in heterogeneous UAV networks.

Abstract: This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the
secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy
constraints. Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or
overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where
UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve
ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex
coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical
optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex
(d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV
positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided
heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for
trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics
policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware,
security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM

baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness
across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

### [328] [StreamME: Simplify 3D Gaussian Avatar within Live Stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17029)
*Luchuan Song,Yang Zhou,Zhan Xu,Yi Zhou,Deepali Aneja,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: StreamME is a method for fast 3D avatar reconstruction from live video streams without pre-cached data using on-the-fly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of fast and efficient 3D avatar reconstruction for real-time applications while minimizing data dependency.

Method: StreamME utilizes a modified 3D Gaussian Splatting approach, replacing MLPs with geometry and employing point simplification strategies for optimized performance.

Result: The proposed method achieves fast adaptation to facial expressions with high efficiency, enhancing privacy and reducing bandwidth requirements in various VR and online conference settings.

Conclusion: StreamME enables seamless real-time 3D avatar reconstruction with applications in animation, toonify, and relighting, demonstrating its versatility and potential practical use.

Abstract: We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The
StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video
streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the
reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast
training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our
approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating
the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which
significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further
ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification
strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more
sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining
rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method
protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or
online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream
application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our

### [329] [GhostUMAP2: Measuring and Analyzing (r,d)-Stability of UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17174)
*Myeongwon Jung,Takanori Fujiwara,Jaemin Jo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper identifies the instability in UMAP's stochastic optimization process and introduces an (r,d)-stability framework to evaluate and improve projection stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability caused by stochastic elements in UMAP projections, which can lead to unreliable representations of neighboring structures.

Method: The authors introduce ghosts, or duplicates of data points, to assess projection stability, using an (r,d)-stability measure and an adaptive dropping scheme to reduce runtime and computational cost.

Result: The method enables a runtime reduction of up to 60% while retaining approximately 90% of unstable points, demonstrating effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully improves the stability analysis of UMAP projections and provides a practical tool for interactive exploration of projection stability.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP), the impact of its stochastic optimization process on the results
remains underexplored. We observed that it often produces unstable results
where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather
than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we
introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic
positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic
elements, specifically initial projection positions and negative sampling,
impact UMAP results, we introduce "ghosts", or duplicates of data points
representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a
data point's projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle
of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius
d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we
develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared
to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable
points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive
exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of
real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our
framework.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper reviews controllable video generation methods, focusing on how additional non-textual conditions can enhance user-directed content creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitations of text-only video generation inputs, which fail to capture complex user intent, driving the necessity for more precise and multi-modal control methods.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review of controllable video generation, analyzing theoretical foundations, recent advancements, and methods categorized by control signals like single-condition, multi-condition, and universal mechanisms.

Result: The review identifies approaches integrating text and non-text controls such as camera motion and depth maps, enhancing the applicability of video generation models.

Conclusion: By improving controllability in video synthesis, the paper emphasizes the potential for more user-specific, refined, and practical AIGC-driven video creation systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation
has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular,
the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand
for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user
intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video
generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,
multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it
challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current
models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of
additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human
pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable
video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical
applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we
provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both
theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by
introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation
models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,
analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the
denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods
based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition
generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

### [331] [Budget Allocation Policies for Real-Time Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16874)
*Raz Beck,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses Real-Time Multi-Agent Pathfinding (RT-MAPF), exploring strategies to allocate planning budgets for agents effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize real-time path planning for agents in constrained situations by exploring budget allocation strategies.

Method: The authors analyzed different policies for distributing planning budgets across agents in windowed MAPF algorithms like PrP and MAPF-LNS2.

Result: Policies that allocate planning budgets over agents were found more effective than shared-budget strategies in solving over-constrained problems.

Conclusion: Distributing planning budgets across agents allows better problem-solving and shorter makespan in RT-MAPF setups.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for a set of
agents such that each agent reaches its desired destination while avoiding
collisions with the other agents. Many MAPF solvers are designed to run
offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them.
Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot
wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to
move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must
commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time,
referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively
call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without
explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and
explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed
versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and
MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents
draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained
situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the
agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.

*Chengxuan Xia,Qianye Wu,Sixuan Tian,Yilun Hao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper presents a dynamic coordination framework for multi-agent large language models (LLMs) that improves adaptability and performance over static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent LLM frameworks often rely on rigid workflows, fixed roles, and limited communication, making them less effective in complex, open-ended scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation, allowing agents to reallocate tasks, exchange critiques, and compete on ambiguous subtasks for better results.

Result: The framework demonstrates significant improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency when compared to static and partially adaptive baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive coordination and structured competition enhance the performance of multi-agent LLM systems in collaborative tasks, highlighting their promise for complex applications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for
collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often
rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication,
reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper
proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core
mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent
evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence
and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and
crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of
the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular
architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage,
coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our
findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and
structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.

*Mariam ALMutairi,Hyungmin Kim*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework combining blockchain technology and decentralized LLM-powered multi-agent negotiation to improve medical supply chains' resilience during crises like pandemics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and adaptability in medical supply chains exposed during global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Method: The framework merges blockchain for transparent enforcement with decentralized agents powered by large language models (LLMs) for adaptive negotiation, connected through a cross-layer communication protocol.

Result: A simulated pandemic scenario demonstrated enhanced negotiation efficiency, fairer resource allocation, improved supply chain responsiveness, and higher auditability.

Conclusion: This innovative integration of blockchain and LLM-driven agents provides a scalable, robust solution for critical supply chain coordination during uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed
critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including
inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor
adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid
framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large
language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the
resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this
system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and
healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and
decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical
allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports
adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain
layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions
via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer
communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional
enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates
the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency,
fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This
research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust
guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a
robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under
uncertainty.

*Hugh Adams,Srijoni Majumdar,Evangelos Pournaras*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method for participatory budgeting, aimed at improving voter decision-making and ensuring fair compromises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like choice overload in participatory budgeting and support fair distribution of public funds by aiding voters and policymakers with decision-making.

Method: The study employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach with a novel branching neural network for scalable and decentralized optimization of voter actions.

Result: Experimental evaluation with real-world data demonstrates that fair compromise is achievable, particularly through selecting projects with smaller costs.

Conclusion: The approach provides ethical decision support, benefiting both voters and policymakers, and identifies design strategies for fairer participatory budgeting.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and
addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it
is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds.
Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can
lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to
decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying
voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This
novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of
election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a
novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a
branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of
multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are
found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter
preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world
participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is
achievable through projects with smaller cost.

*Yue Han,Elliot Anshelevich*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper explores the compatibility of four objectives in the metric facility location problem and demonstrates the existence of solutions that are near-optimal for multiple objectives simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether it is possible to achieve simultaneous near-optimized solutions for multiple conflicting objectives in facility location or committee selection problems, rather than optimizing each objective separately.

Method: The authors analyze how different objectives for clients—minimizing sum or maximum distances—interact, and investigate the existence of solutions that balance pairwise trade-offs in arbitrary metric spaces.

Result: The study finds that it is feasible, in many cases, to select facilities in a way that yields solutions that are close-to-optimum for multiple objectives simultaneously.

Conclusion: The research concludes that compromise solutions can often be achieved in facility location problems, enabling high-quality outcomes for several competing objectives.

Abstract: We study a version of the metric facility location problem (or, equivalently,
variants of the committee selection problem) in which we must choose $k$
facilities in an arbitrary metric space to serve some set of clients $C$. We
consider four different objectives, where each client $i\in C$ attempts to
minimize either the sum or the maximum of its distance to the chosen
facilities, and where the overall objective either considers the sum or the
maximum of the individual client costs. Rather than optimizing a single
objective at a time, we study how compatible these objectives are with each
other, and show the existence of solutions which are simultaneously
close-to-optimum for any pair of the above objectives. Our results show that
when choosing a set of facilities or a representative committee, it is often
possible to form a solution which is good for several objectives at the same
time, instead of sacrificing one desideratum to achieve another.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: AI systems integrating weather data boost taxi drivers' revenue by 107.3%, outperforming route-only optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's broader potential in transportation beyond route optimization.

Method: Compared traditional methods, route-only AI, and weather-aware AI systems using simulated data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions.

Result: Weather-aware AI systems showed way higher economic benefits, increasing annual fleet revenue significantly and indicating untapped market potential.

Conclusion: Future AI solutions should integrate multifaceted approaches like weather intelligence to maximize operational efficiency.

Abstract: While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve
taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture
only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive
weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction
with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance
against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation
data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that
weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\%
improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the
largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between
meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals
annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback
periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current
AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by
focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents
an untapped \$8.9 billion market opportunity. Our results indicate that future
AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple
operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing isolated
functions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework to improve breast cancer detection from mammograms, offering better robustness and interpretability compared to conventional AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models for mammogram analysis often focus on single-view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting their diagnostic utility for breast cancer detection.

Method: The proposed framework combines a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone for both local feature extraction and capturing global dependencies. It incorporates a gated attention-based fusion module to dynamically handle multi-view data, even in cases with missing information.

Result: The framework outperforms baseline models, achieving high metrics such as an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830 in binary BI-RADS classification, while also performing competitively in more complex tasks.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework demonstrates the potential of multitask learning to improve diagnostic accuracy and offers a valuable tool for clinically meaningful mammography interpretation, though challenges in complex tasks remain.

Abstract: Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for
effective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to
subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches
fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting
their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four
standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS
scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,
combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual
State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To
improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based
fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively
handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across
diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models
against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and
multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently
outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,
the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.
For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of
0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.
These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and
underscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for
improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography
analysis.

TL;DR: This paper reviews advances in medical image harmonization, particularly for MRI, addressing site-related biases. It highlights methods, challenges, and future directions, emphasizing deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address significant heterogeneity in medical imaging datasets caused by site effects, which impair model generalizability and reduce the reliability of analysis.

Method: The paper categorizes and reviews harmonization strategies across the imaging pipeline, such as acquisition/reconstruction methods, image-level and feature-level corrections, and traveling-subject-based techniques. It emphasizes deep learning approaches.

Result: The review synthesizes and evaluates current methodologies for mitigating site-related biases in medical imaging, linking them to their effectiveness and limitations in preserving biological signals.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while progress has been made, significant challenges remain in image harmonization, such as standardization and generalizability, and suggests future research avenues.

Abstract: Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience
research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across
different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit
substantial heterogeneity, known as "batch effects" or "site effects". These
non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals,
reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the
generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization
aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving
meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and
consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts,
methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and
future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging
pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition
and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level
methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an
exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis
on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges
that remain and outline promising avenues for future research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmartPath-R1, a multimodal large language model designed for computational pathology, addressing complex diagnostic tasks with multiscale and multitask capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models in pathology are restricted in reasoning capabilities and primarily limited to simple visual question answering at the region-of-interest level. There is a need for more versatile tools that address comprehensive diagnostic tasks such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, and whole-slide-image classification.

Method: The proposed framework, SmartPath-R1, employs scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning to eliminate reliance on chain-of-thought supervision. Additionally, it utilizes a mixture-of-experts mechanism for multiscale and multitask analysis.

Result: SmartPath-R1 was trained and evaluated using a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples. It demonstrated effectiveness across 72 diverse tasks, validating its robustness and superiority.

Conclusion: SmartPath-R1 signifies a notable advancement in the development of AI systems for precision pathology, capable of robust reasoning and handling varied diagnostic tasks effectively.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate
pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic
analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks
that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However,
current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained
reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive
chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to
simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest
(ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as
ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI)
classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present
SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both
ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning
capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and
task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for
chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM.
Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through
a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks.
We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI
samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks
validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work
represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Pixel Anchor Module and a self-attention-based Top_k strategy to improve lesion segmentation in prostate cancer medical imaging, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prostate cancer lesion segmentation faces challenges due to semantic confusion caused by high similarity between lesion and non-lesion regions, making it difficult for existing methods to accurately identify lesion areas.

Method: The proposed method includes a Pixel Anchor Module to identify sparse feature anchors for enhanced global context capture, a self-attention-based Top_k selection for refining anchor identification, and a focal loss function to address class imbalance.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the PI-CAI dataset, with 69.73% IoU and 74.32% Dice scores, significantly improving the detection of prostate cancer lesions.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses semantic confusion in medical image segmentation, improving lesion identification and advancing accuracy in prostate cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and
progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in
formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic
homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image
segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics,
resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a
sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global
contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion
regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to
further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a
focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more
precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU
and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion
detection.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Mammo-Mamba,' an AI-powered CAD framework combining Selective State-Space Models, transformer-based attention, and expert-driven feature refinement for efficient and accurate multi-view mammogram classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer remains a major cause of mortality among women, and accurate mammogram interpretation is essential for early detection. However, current Transformer-based models are computationally intensive, necessitating efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors propose Mammo-Mamba, which integrates Selective State-Space Models, a Sequential Mixture of Experts mechanism, and content-adaptive feature refinement into the MambaVision backbone for mammogram classification.

Result: Mammo-Mamba demonstrated superior classification performance across key metrics when tested on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, while retaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed Mammo-Mamba framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing Transformer-based CAD models for mammogram analysis by balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality among women, despite recent advances in Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) systems. Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms
is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view
mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures,
their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image
patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this
challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective
State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven
feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the
MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE)
mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified
MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution
mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These
blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model
to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,
effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.
Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior
classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining

### [342] [MCM: Mamba-based Cardiac Motion Tracking using Sequential Images in MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17678)
*Jiahui Yin,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan,Yan Pang,Declan O'Regan,Hadrien Reynaud,Qingjie Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for cardiac motion tracking that uses sequential imaging, achieving smoother and more consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cardiac motion tracking often lack smoothness and consistency due to their use of single image pairs, ignoring the continuous nature of cardiac motion.

Method: The authors developed a Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) using a bi-directional Mamba block, a scanning mechanism, and a motion decoder to enhance temporal coherence without additional computational load.

Result: The proposed method was tested on two public datasets, showing superior performance quantitatively and qualitatively compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method achieves smooth and consistent cardiac motion tracking by leveraging sequential image data and structured state-space dynamics, thereby setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing
methods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame
and a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these
methods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield
inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a
novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly
incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and
temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba
block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates
the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion
decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target
frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking
advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method
learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without
increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two
public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and
state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods. The code is

*Mohammad Saleh Refahi,Gavin Hearne,Harrison Muller,Kieran Lynch,Bahrad A. Sokhansanj,James R. Brown,Gail Rosen*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper evaluates embedding-based similarity search methods for genomic analysis using gene embeddings, exploring alternatives to traditional alignment-heavy tools such as BLAST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of DNA data and limitations of heuristic-based methods like BLAST necessitate scalable, efficient solutions for genome similarity search.

Method: Evaluation of two vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, specifically applied to bioinformatics gene embeddings with benchmarks measuring their performance.

Result: Findings show computational advantages (better memory and runtime efficiency) and improved retrieval quality for novel sequences.

Conclusion: Embedding-based methods provide a promising alternative to traditional tools, advancing the detection and understanding of novel and divergent genomic sequences.

Abstract: The exponential growth of DNA sequencing data has outpaced traditional
heuristic-based methods, which struggle to scale effectively. Efficient
computational approaches are urgently needed to support large-scale similarity
search, a foundational task in bioinformatics for detecting homology,
functional similarity, and novelty among genomic and proteomic sequences.
Although tools like BLAST have been widely used and remain effective in many
scenarios, they suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and
poor performance on divergent sequences.
  In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn
latent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns
beyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art
vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene
embeddings. Unlike prior studies, our analysis focuses on
bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting
novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking
known homologs. Our results highlight both computational advantages (in memory
and runtime efficiency) and improved retrieval quality, offering a promising
alternative to traditional alignment-heavy tools.

components: a direct translation of the original Okada model into PyTorch, and
a convenient wrapper interface for efficiently computing gradients and Hessians
with respect to either observation station coordinates or fault parameters.
This differentiable framework is well suited for fault parameter inversion,
including gradient-based optimization, Bayesian inference, and integration with

TL;DR: BCI technology aims to improve communication between the brain and external devices. A new method, frequency-phase-space encoding, coupled with high-density EEG recordings, significantly enhances information transfer rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual BCI systems suffer from limited information transfer rates due to insufficient spatial resolution in conventional EEG recordings, restricting practical application.

Method: The study introduces a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method and employs high-density EEG systems with configurations ranging from 64 to 256 channels to utilize richer spatiotemporal dynamics.

Result: The new encoding method significantly increased theoretical ITRs by up to 195.56% in tests with high-density EEG setups. In practical use, the BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm.

Conclusion: The research highlights high-density EEG's key role in utilizing spatiotemporal information, paving the way for faster and more efficient BCI systems.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology establishes a direct communication
pathway between the brain and external devices. Current visual BCI systems
suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use.
Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains
underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of
recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of
brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding
method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG)
recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase
encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode
configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50%
over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding
200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and
103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm.
This study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of
high-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli.

TL;DR: HypoChainer is introduced as a visualization framework combining human expertise, large language models (LLMs), and knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve hypothesis generation and validation for scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern scientific discovery struggles with managing the immense complexity of biological systems, cognitive limitations in researchers, costly experimentation, and unreliable hypothesis generation methods.

Method: HypoChainer integrates three stages: (1) exploration and contextualization using retrieval-augmented LLMs and GNN predictions, (2) formation of hypothesis chains with iterative refinement via LLM and KG involvement, and (3) prioritization of hypotheses through KG evidence and visual analytics.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness via case studies and expert interviews, showcasing scalable and interpretable tools for enhancing breakthroughs in biomedical and drug research.

Conclusion: HypoChainer holds promise to revolutionize hypothesis-driven research by blending AI tools and human expertise for structured and reliable scientific discovery.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery faces growing challenges in integrating vast and
heterogeneous knowledge critical to breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug
development. Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is
constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems,
and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models,
especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction
generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for
validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering
and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in
structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we
propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates
human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance
hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages:
First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented
LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN
predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain
formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions
and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG
suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are
filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates
for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in
reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in
two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support
interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.

Motivation: To explore whether eye and head tracking can provide insights into practitioner skill development and complement traditional clinical training evaluations.

Method: 24 practitioners underwent simulated baby delivery training sessions, during which metrics like pupillary response rate, fixation duration, and angular velocity were calculated.

Result: Head-related features achieved F1 score of 0.85 and AUC of 0.86, while pupil-related features achieved F1 score of 0.77 and AUC of 0.85.

Conclusion: Eye and head tracking offer a promising tool for implicit skill assessment and complementary clinical training evaluations using commodity eye-tracking glasses.

Abstract: We examined eye and head movements to gain insights into skill development in
clinical settings. A total of 24 practitioners participated in simulated baby
delivery training sessions. We calculated key metrics, including pupillary
response rate, fixation duration, or angular velocity. Our findings indicate
that eye and head tracking can effectively differentiate between trained and
untrained practitioners, particularly during labor tasks. For example,
head-related features achieved an F1 score of 0.85 and AUC of 0.86, whereas
pupil-related features achieved F1 score of 0.77 and AUC of 0.85. The results
lay the groundwork for computational models that support implicit skill
assessment and training in clinical settings by using commodity eye-tracking
glasses as a complementary device to more traditional evaluation methods such
as subjective scores.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reality Proxy, a system enabling users to interact with abstract representations (proxies) of physical objects in Mixed Reality (MR), sidestepping real-world constraints and enhancing usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address difficulties in interacting with crowded, distant, or occluded real-world objects in Mixed Reality environments by decoupling such interactions from physical constraints.

Method: They introduce a system, Reality Proxy, which replaces direct interaction with physical objects using their proxies equipped with AI-driven semantic attributes and spatial relationships, facilitating intuitive and advanced interactions in MR.

Result: Reality Proxy demonstrated versatility in multiple use cases such as office data retrieval, spatial navigation, and managing multiple drones. Expert evaluations highlighted its utility and usability.

Conclusion: Proxy-based abstractions in MR systems are a promising interaction paradigm, capable of improving usability and enabling novel interactions without the need for new gestures or menu systems.

Abstract: Interacting with real-world objects in Mixed Reality (MR) often proves
difficult when they are crowded, distant, or partially occluded, hindering
straightforward selection and manipulation. We observe that these difficulties
stem from performing interaction directly on physical objects, where input is
tightly coupled to their physical constraints. Our key insight is to decouple
interaction from these constraints by introducing proxies-abstract
representations of real-world objects. We embody this concept in Reality Proxy,
a system that seamlessly shifts interaction targets from physical objects to
their proxies during selection. Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality
Proxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical
spatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel
and previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming,
attribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object
selections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate
Reality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office
information retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control.
An expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting
that proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction
paradigm for future MR systems.

### [349] [Explainable AI for Collaborative Assessment of 2D/3D Registration Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17597)
*Sue Min Cho,Alexander Do,Russell H. Taylor,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces an AI framework for verifying 2D/3D registration quality in surgical navigation, with explainability features to support human decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for reliable quality assurance in surgical imaging alignment, as current methods fail to prevent potential errors that could lead to severe surgical complications.

Method: The AI framework uses explainable AI (XAI) to assess and verify the quality of 2D/3D registrations in surgery, and the research involves testing different combinations of human and AI decision-making systems.

Result: The results showed explainability features improve user trust, but AI-only systems still outperform in performance. Human-AI collaboration requires further development to achieve optimal outcomes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while XAI has potential to support human operators in surgery, further innovations are needed to enhance its practical application in ensuring robust 2D/3D registration quality.

Abstract: As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated
imaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex
sub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for
patient safety. This shift introduces new "operator-type" roles tasked with
verifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of
the procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant
placement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based
surgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D
data. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they
occasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can
lead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical
need for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone
have been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D
registration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial
intelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality
verification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's
decision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed
decision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with
a rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered
evaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,
human-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features
modestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not
exceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work
extending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements
holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.

TL;DR: This paper examines how smartphone-based respiration biosignal feedback and mindfulness skill estimation impact the usability of digital mindfulness apps, incorporating algorithms developed to track respiration and estimate mindfulness skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve long-term user engagement in smartphone-based mindfulness apps, addressing this through innovative use of biosignal feedback and skill estimation.

Method: It involves developing a smartphone accelerometer-based respiration tracking algorithm, creating a quantitative framework for estimating mindfulness skills, and testing these on 261 mindfulness sessions in controlled and real-world settings.

Result: The paper demonstrates that respiration feedback improves app usability, the tracking model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.6 breaths per minute, and skill estimation framework delivers 80-84% F1 scores in monitoring skill progression.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating respiration tracking and mindfulness skill estimation into a commercial app enhances the effectiveness of smartphone-based mindfulness training through accurate data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Mindfulness training is widely recognized for its benefits in reducing
depression, anxiety, and loneliness. With the rise of smartphone-based
mindfulness apps, digital meditation has become more accessible, but sustaining
long-term user engagement remains a challenge. This paper explores whether
respiration biosignal feedback and mindfulness skill estimation enhance system
usability and skill development. We develop a smartphone's accelerometer-based
respiration tracking algorithm, eliminating the need for additional wearables.
Unlike existing methods, our approach accurately captures slow breathing
patterns typical of mindfulness meditation. Additionally, we introduce the
first quantitative framework to estimate mindfulness skills-concentration,
sensory clarity, and equanimity-based on accelerometer-derived respiration
data. We develop and test our algorithms on 261 mindfulness sessions in both
controlled and real-world settings. A user study comparing an experimental
group receiving biosignal feedback with a control group using a standard app
shows that respiration feedback enhances system usability. Our respiration
tracking model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute,
closely aligning with ground truth data, while our mindfulness skill estimation
attains F1 scores of 80-84% in tracking skill progression. By integrating
respiration tracking and mindfulness estimation into a commercial app, we
demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness
training.

*Minsoo Kim,Jip Kim*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The study introduces a specialized deep neural network approach to bypass complex computations of traditional optimal transmission switching methods in power systems, ensuring scalability and physical feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational complexity of mixed-integer formulations in conventional optimal transmission switching methods makes them impractical for large power grids, necessitating scalable solutions.

Method: The proposed method uses a dispatch-aware deep neural network that incorporates a differentiable DC optimal power flow layer, predicts transmission line states, and optimizes based on generation cost to ensure physical feasibility.

Result: The dispatch-aware neural network produces feasible topology and dispatch solutions in the same duration required for basic DC optimal power flow computations, outperforming traditional methods in scalability.

Conclusion: The novel approach effectively balances computational efficiency and economic advantages in large-scale grid optimization by integrating physical constraints into the learning process.

Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by
selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation
increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with
this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates
DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and
passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting
generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints
are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a
customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible
from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once
trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch
pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer
solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully
captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Hybrid models for probabilistic building energy modeling show promise, with residual learning using neural networks achieving best average performance and ensuring intuitive results for out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in hybrid approaches for building energy modeling by incorporating uncertainty and systematically comparing methods within a probabilistic framework.

Method: Evaluate five hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy modeling in a real-world case, focusing on quantile predictions of thermodynamics.

Result: Residual learning with neural networks performs best on average. Quantile Conformal Prediction effectively calibrates indoor temperature quantile predictions.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches are promising, but residual learning provides the best and most physically intuitive results, especially in uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of
building energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been
explored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely
data-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths
of both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as
learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between
simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world
measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven
models, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the
data-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain.
First, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting
the inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and
occupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a
probabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating
five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy
modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a
real-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the
performance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types,
but residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on
average. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces
physically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data.
Second, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating
quantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset and tasks to evaluate LLMs' ability to track ingredient states in cooking recipes, showing promising results in understanding cooking processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that LLMs face in understanding real-world phenomena like cooking, as they lack intermediate ingredient state information in recipes.

Method: The authors propose a novel dataset with annotated ingredient state changes in Japanese recipes and design three tasks for evaluating LLMs' ability to recognize ingredient states over cooking procedures.

Result: Experiments with Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B show that incorporating ingredient state knowledge significantly enhances LLMs' comprehension of cooking, performing comparably to commercial LLMs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of ingredient state annotations for improving LLMs' understanding of domain-specific procedures like cooking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural
texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of
cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients
are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states
and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a
method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the
domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well
LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We
first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate
annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and
controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to
evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify
ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used
LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state
knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving
performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

Motivation: To analyze the trends, patterns, and priorities in disaster informatics research during the specified period, especially in the context of COVID-19's influence on global research.

Method: The study utilized pre-trained language models, generative AI, and bibliometric analysis on a large-scale dataset to assess topics, collaboration networks, and institutional and geographic contributions.

Result: Key findings include regional and language-based collaboration networks, focused authorship topics, diversified institutional interests, and a research shift prioritizing public health due to COVID-19. Research also emphasized resilience and cross-sectoral data-sharing strategies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the evolution of disaster informatics, encourages the use of multidimensional resilience strategies, and offers actionable insights for stakeholders to improve capacities in handling global disaster risks.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic analysis of the
disaster informatics literature published between January 2020 to September
2022. Leveraging a large-scale corpus and advanced techniques such as
pre-trained language models and generative AI, we identify the most active
countries, institutions, authors, collaboration networks, emergent topics,
patterns among the most significant topics, and shifts in research priorities
spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight (1) countries that
were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active,
with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and
institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to
collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or
two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific
topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics,
and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster
informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate
that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and
cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened
awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality
assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and
summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to
comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the
trends in disaster informatics, our analysis offers strategic insights for
policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster
informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MADD, a framework to model disinformation dissemination more realistically, incorporating dynamic bots and evaluating correction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies oversimplify user and network modeling, neglect the dynamic behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of disinformation correction methods.

Method: The authors propose MADD, which integrates the Barabasi Albert Model and Stochastic Block Model for network topology, uses real-world user attributes, and includes dynamic bots for simulations.

Result: MADD successfully simulates realistic dissemination scenarios with six disinformation topics, showing different impacts of fact-based and narrative-based corrections.

Conclusion: MADD improves understanding of social bots' roles in disinformation ecosystems and enables quantitative evaluation of correction strategies.

Abstract: In the human-bot symbiotic information ecosystem, social bots play key roles
in spreading and correcting disinformation. Understanding their influence is
essential for risk control and better governance. However, current studies
often rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook the dynamic
behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. To
fill these gaps, we propose MADD, a Multi Agent based framework for
Disinformation Dissemination. MADD constructs a more realistic propagation
network by integrating the Barabasi Albert Model for scale free topology and
the Stochastic Block Model for community structures, while designing node
attributes based on real world user data. Furthermore, MADD incorporates both
malicious and legitimate bots, with their controlled dynamic participation
allows for quantitative analysis of correction strategies. We evaluate MADD
using individual and group level metrics. We experimentally verify the real
world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure, and we
simulate the dissemination of six disinformation topics, demonstrating the
differential effects of fact based and narrative based correction strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in predicting changes in social media behavior, such as network shifts and friend recommendations, with the goal of enhancing user experience and mitigating risks.

Method: The study utilizes open-source large language models like Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and Gemma-7B-IT alongside GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa in a joint embedding and prompt-engineering setup.

Result: GPT-2 in a Cross-modal configuration demonstrated superior predictive performance with the lowest perplexity of 8.21, outperforming both RoBERTa and BERT.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the utility of advanced AI models and Cross-modal configurations in forecasting social media evolution, providing actionable insights for risk prevention and enhancing digital interactions.

Abstract: Social media platforms serve as a significant medium for sharing personal
emotions, daily activities, and various life events, ensuring individuals stay
informed about the latest developments. From the initiation of an account,
users progressively expand their circle of friends or followers, engaging
actively by posting, commenting, and sharing content. Over time, user behavior
on these platforms evolves, influenced by demographic attributes and the
networks they form. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages
open-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through
prompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint
embedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on
social media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of
these models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including
network changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities.
Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2
achieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration,
outperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of
leveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach
addresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations
and activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user
behavior. By anticipating future interactions and activities, this research
aims to provide early warnings about potential negative outcomes, enabling
users to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in the long term.

### [357] [Weak Links in LinkedIn: Enhancing Fake Profile Detection in the Age of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16860)
*Apoorva Gulati,Rajesh Kumar,Vinti Agarwal,Aditya Sharma*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study focuses on evaluating and enhancing the robustness of text-based fake profile detectors on LinkedIn against large language model (LLM)-generated profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing ease of creating realistic fake profiles using LLMs like GPT, which threatens the efficacy of traditional fake profile detectors.

Method: The researchers assessed existing detectors' robustness against GPT-generated profiles and introduced GPT-assisted adversarial training to improve detection performance.

Result: Existing detectors showed poor performance with LLM-generated profiles, with False Accept Rates of 42-52%. The proposed GPT-assisted training improved it to 1-7%, while maintaining False Reject Rates of 0.5-2%.

Conclusion: GPT-assisted adversarial training significantly enhances the robustness of fake profile detectors, especially when using combined numerical and textual embeddings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake
profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for
text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of
existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in
detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the
existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate:
42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure,
restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False
Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on
combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness,
followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using
textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based
GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors
such as the one proposed in this study.

*Charlotte Jennings,Andrew Broad,Lucy Godson,Emily Clarke,David Westhead,Darren Treanor*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews the integration of histopathology and molecular data for cancer survival prediction, finding promising yet methodologically limited results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness and challenges of combining histopathology (WSIs) and molecular data for cancer survival prediction.

Method: A systematic review of 48 studies across 19 cancer types, analyzing data using frameworks like CHARMS and PROBAST+AI, and adhering to SWiM and PRISMA workflows.

Result: Multimodal models generally outperformed unimodal approaches, with reported c-indices ranging from 0.550 to 0.857. However, studies exhibited high biases, limited external validation, and minimal focus on clinical utility.

Conclusion: Multimodal WSI-omics approaches have potential but require better methodological rigor, diverse datasets, and clinical evaluation for real-world relevance.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning integrating histopathology and molecular data
shows promise for cancer prognostication. We systematically reviewed studies
combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict
overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL
(12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data
extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed
SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745).
  Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all
used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression
(n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged
0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However,
all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little
focus on clinical utility.
  Multimodal WSI-omics survival prediction is a fast-growing field with
promising results but needs improved methodological rigor, broader datasets,
and clinical evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGNITE, a comprehensive, publicly available dataset for studying the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), focusing on tissue segmentation, nuclei detection, and PD-L1 positive cell identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in available NSCLC digital pathology datasets, including lack of metastatic site annotations and molecular information such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), which are critical for supporting biomarker development and improving immunotherapy response predictions.

Method: The authors developed the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, multi-scanner dataset consisting of 887 annotated regions of interest derived from 155 NSCLC patients. The dataset supports tasks such as multi-class tissue segmentation in H&E-stained slides, nuclei detection, and PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC-stained slides.

Result: They publicly released the IGNITE dataset, uniquely featuring manual annotations for metastatic sites and PD-L1 IHC, with data applicable to three tasks: segmentation of 16 tissue classes, nuclei detection, and PD-L1 cell identification.

Conclusion: The IGNITE dataset addresses significant gaps in current NSCLC research datasets, providing an invaluable resource for computational pathology and aiding the development of better algorithms for biomarker discovery and treatment response prediction.

Abstract: The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) histopathology contains morphological and molecular characteristics
predictive of immunotherapy response. Computational quantification of TIME
characteristics, such as cell detection and tissue segmentation, can support
biomarker development. However, currently available digital pathology datasets
of NSCLC for the development of cell detection or tissue segmentation
algorithms are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent
metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1
immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data
toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated
NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of
interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i)
multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides,
with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection,
and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first public NSCLC dataset with manual
annotations of H&E in metastatic sites and PD-L1 IHC.

### [360] [A Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16826)
*Qikai Wei,Huansheng Ning,Chunlong Han,Jianguo Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces QMKGF, a new approach to improve Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) performance by creating query-aware knowledge graphs and optimizing semantic relevance in retrieval tasks, achieving significant improvements, especially in the HotpotQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods mainly focus on retrieving isolated segments via similarity-based matching, neglecting intrinsic connections between them, which impacts performance.

Method: QMKGF designs prompt templates for entity and relation extraction using LLMs to construct knowledge graphs. It employs a multi-path subgraph strategy and a query-aware attention reward model to enhance semantic alignment, ultimately using enriched knowledge graphs to expand query representation.

Result: On evaluation datasets like HotpotQA, SQuAD, and others, QMKGF outperformed baseline approaches, achieving notable metrics improvements, e.g., a 9.72% ROUGE-1 score increase in HotpotQA.

Conclusion: QMKGF effectively integrates query-aware knowledge graph techniques into RAG, enhancing semantic relevance and retrieval performance, as demonstrated by experimental outcomes across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising
paradigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content
generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies
primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching
methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This
limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF,
a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing
Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ
general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a
knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a
multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations,
multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the
semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query.
Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores
subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we
select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples
from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query.
Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are
utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic
representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF
on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA
dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\%, surpassing the
BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\% to 64.98\%).
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF
approach.

*Giovanni De Toni,Erasmo Purificato,Emilia Gómez,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini,Cristian Consonni*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method to limit harmful recommendations in personalized recommender systems while relying only on simple user binary feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems often propagate irrelevant, harmful, or unwanted content, degrading user satisfaction and contributing to problems like misinformation, radicalization, and erosion of trust.

Method: The authors propose a model-agnostic method using conformal risk control to ensure limits on unwanted content. They address limitations of traditional methods by using implicit feedback to expand recommendation sets while maintaining risk mitigation.

Result: Experimental results on a popular video-sharing platform show that their method effectively reduces harmful recommendations while requiring minimal effort.

Conclusion: The approach successfully ensures controllable and effective reduction of undesired recommendations, making it a practical contribution to improving recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommenders are significantly shaping online information consumption. While
effective at personalizing content, these systems increasingly face criticism
for propagating irrelevant, unwanted, and even harmful recommendations. Such
content degrades user satisfaction and contributes to significant societal
issues, including misinformation, radicalization, and erosion of user trust.
Although platforms offer mechanisms to mitigate exposure to undesired content,
these mechanisms are often insufficiently effective and slow to adapt to users'
feedback. This paper introduces an intuitive, model-agnostic, and
distribution-free method that uses conformal risk control to provably bound
unwanted content in personalized recommendations by leveraging simple binary
feedback on items. We also address a limitation of traditional conformal risk
control approaches, i.e., the fact that the recommender can provide a smaller
set of recommended items, by leveraging implicit feedback on consumed items to
expand the recommendation set while ensuring robust risk mitigation. Our
experimental evaluation on data coming from a popular online video-sharing
platform demonstrates that our approach ensures an effective and controllable
reduction of unwanted recommendations with minimal effort. The source code is

*Ramin Giahi,Kehui Yao,Sriram Kollipara,Kai Zhao,Vahid Mirjalili,Jianpeng Xu,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VL-CLIP, a framework improving e-commerce recommendations by enhancing visual and textual embeddings in existing vision-language models. It achieves significant improvements in key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing vision-language models, like weak object alignment, ambiguous text, and domain mismatch, which hinder effective recommendations in e-commerce.

Method: The framework combines Visual Grounding for refined image representations and an LLM-based agent to create enriched textual embeddings for better multimodal alignment.

Result: The approach improved Click-Through Rate (CTR) by 18.6%, Add-To-Cart (ATC) by 15.5%, and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) by 4.0% on a large e-commerce platform, outperforming several baseline models.

Conclusion: VL-CLIP demonstrates the effectiveness of combining object-aware visual grounding with LLM-enhanced text embedding for precise multimodal recommendations, addressing critical shortcomings of prior models.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation
platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding.
However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in
e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global
image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to
suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where
product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal
matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not
generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we
propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating
Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent
for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image
representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances
textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach
significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,
and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the
largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by
15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework
outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in
both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining
object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust
multimodal recommendations.

*Conor McNamara,Effirul Ramlan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a citation recommendation algorithm utilizing Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to enhance multi-view representation learning, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively integrating multiple modalities in scholarly documents for citation recommendation.

Method: The method employs Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to model non-linear relationships between textual and graph-based representations in citation data.

Result: Experiments on the DBLP dataset show that the algorithm improves citation recommendation metrics such as Mean Average Precision, Precision, and Recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Non-linear transformations in DCCA enhance latent representations, leading to better citation recommendations and ranking quality compared to linear CCA-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in citation recommendation have improved accuracy by
leveraging multi-view representation learning to integrate the various
modalities present in scholarly documents. However, effectively combining
multiple data views requires fusion techniques that can capture complementary
information while preserving the unique characteristics of each modality. We
propose a novel citation recommendation algorithm that improves upon linear
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods by applying Deep CCA (DCCA), a
neural network extension capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships
between distributed textual and graph-based representations of scientific
articles. Experiments on the large-scale DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library
Project) citation network dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art CCA-based methods, achieving relative improvements of over 11%
in Mean Average Precision@10, 5% in Precision@10, and 7% in Recall@10. These
gains reflect more relevant citation recommendations and enhanced ranking
quality, suggesting that DCCA's non-linear transformations yield more
expressive latent representations than CCA's linear projections.

### [364] [Doubly robust outlier resistant inference on causal treatment effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17439)
*Joonsung Kang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges of outliers in estimating causal effects in observational studies, proposing a robust doubly robust point estimator under a penalized empirical likelihood framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outliers can distort causal effect estimation, especially in small sample sizes, requiring robust methods that can handle them without exclusion.

Method: A doubly robust point estimator using a robust estimating equation for outcome regression and covariate balancing propensity scores for propensity modeling, integrated under a penalized empirical likelihood framework with variable selection.

Result: The proposed method shows improved accuracy and robustness in handling outliers compared to existing methods in simulations and applications.

Conclusion: The developed method ensures robust treatment effect estimation and provides reliable confidence intervals even in the presence of outliers in finite samples.

Abstract: Outliers can severely distort causal effect estimation in observational
studies, yet this issue has received limited attention in the literature. Their
influence is especially pronounced in small sample sizes, where detecting and
removing outliers becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore, it is essential to
estimate treatment effects robustly without excluding these influential data
points. To address this, we propose a doubly robust point estimator for the
average treatment effect under a contaminated model that includes outliers.
Robustness in outcome regression is achieved through a robust estimating
equation, while covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) ensure resilience
in propensity score modeling.
  To prevent model overfitting due to the inclusion of numerous parameters, we
incorporate variable selection. All these components are unified under a
penalized empirical likelihood framework. For confidence interval estimation,
most existing approaches rely on asymptotic properties, which may be unreliable
in finite samples. We derive an optimal finite-sample confidence interval for
the average treatment effect using our proposed estimating equation, ensuring
that the interval bounds remain unaffected by outliers. Through simulations and
a real-world application involving hypertension data with outliers, we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in
both accuracy and robustness.

*Paul Saves*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This thesis addresses optimizing high-dimensional black-box problems, particularly in the context of aircraft design, using a surrogate-based Bayesian optimization method called EGO, with enhancements to overcome dimensionality issues and handle mixed-design variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve realistic engineering problems like aircraft design, where optimization of high-dimensional, mixed-variable black-box models is essential, and where existing methods like EGO fail due to dimensionality challenges.

Method: Investigate parameterization tools like partial least squares regression for dimensionality reduction and adapt Bayesian Optimization (EGO) to handle discrete variables effectively in high-dimensional optimization problems.

Result: Proposed methods achieve efficient optimization of models with over 100 variables, applicable to innovative aircraft design such as the 'DRAGON' hybrid airplane.

Conclusion: The study provides practical solutions to optimize high-dimensional multidisciplinary models and shows potential to reduce evaluations and improve aircraft design processes by addressing dimensionality and mixed-variable challenges.

Abstract: The objective of this Philosophiae Doctor (Ph.D) thesis is to propose an
efficient approach for optimizing a multidisciplinary black-box model when the
optimization problem is constrained and involves a large number of mixed
integer design variables (typically 100 variables). The targeted optimization
approach, called EGO, is based on a sequential enrichment of an adaptive
surrogate model and, in this context, GP surrogate models are one of the most
widely used in engineering problems to approximate time-consuming high fidelity
models. EGO is a heuristic BO method that performs well in terms of solution
quality. However, like any other global optimization method, EGO suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, meaning that its performance is satisfactory on
lower dimensional problems, but deteriorates as the dimensionality of the
optimization search space increases. For realistic aircraft design problems,
the typical size of the design variables can even exceed 100 and, thus, trying
to solve directly the problems using EGO is ruled out. The latter is especially
true when the problems involve both continuous and categorical variables
increasing even more the size of the search space. In this Ph.D thesis,
effective parameterization tools are investigated, including techniques like
partial least squares regression, to significantly reduce the number of design
variables. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is adapted to handle discrete
variables and high-dimensional spaces in order to reduce the number of
evaluations when optimizing innovative aircraft concepts such as the "DRAGON"
hybrid airplane to reduce their climate impact.

Conclusion: The presented approach successfully reduces overhead and establishes an efficient projection-free algorithm for constrained DC optimization.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a difference of (smooth) convex

builds upon and complements the framework of Maskan et al. [2025] by
integrating advanced Frank-Wolfe variants to reduce computational overhead. We
empirically show that constrained DC problems can be efficiently solved using a
combination of the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) algorithm
[Tsuji et al., 2022] with warm-starting and the adaptive error bound from
Maskan et al. [2025]. The result is a highly efficient and scalable

TL;DR: The paper presents physics-informed kernels for Gaussian process regression to simulate 2D incompressible velocity fields around aerodynamic profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing Gaussian process priors that satisfy incompressibility and boundary conditions in flow field reconstructions.

Method: The authors developed physics-informed kernels that incorporate incompressibility and boundary conditions into Gaussian process regression, adaptable to various scalar kernels.

Result: The methodology successfully simulated flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil profile without requiring observations at the boundaries.

Conclusion: The proposed method is versatile and provides a flexible framework for engineering applications involving incompressible flow fields.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for
the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A
main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance
functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we derive
physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an
incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These
kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the
incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the
profile in a continuous manner. Such physical and boundary constraints can be
applied to any pre-defined scalar kernel in the proposed methodology, which is
very general and can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of
engineering applications. Its relevance and performances are illustrated by
numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil
profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of efficiently pricing American put options in higher dimensions using advanced neural network methods.

Method: The paper extends the TDGF method to handle free-boundary PDEs in American options and applies a well-crafted sampling strategy. It also uses DGM as a comparison method.

Result: Both TDGF and DGM demonstrate high accuracy and superior computational speed compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, with TDGF being more efficient during training.

Conclusion: Neural network-based methods like TDGF and DGM effectively handle complex option pricing, achieving better performance than traditional methods.

Abstract: In this research, we explore neural network-based methods for pricing
multidimensional American put options under the BlackScholes and Heston model,
extending up to five dimensions. We focus on two approaches: the Time Deep
Gradient Flow (TDGF) method and the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). We extend the
TDGF method to handle the free-boundary partial differential equation inherent
in American options. We carefully design the sampling strategy during training
to enhance performance. Both TDGF and DGM achieve high accuracy while
outperforming conventional Monte Carlo methods in terms of computational speed.
In particular, TDGF tends to be faster during training than DGM.
