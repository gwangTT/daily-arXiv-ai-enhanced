### [1] [A Survey of Task-Oriented Knowledge Graph Reasoning: Status, Applications, and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11012)
*Guanglin Niu,Bo Li,Yangguang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge graph reasoning (KGR), classifying existing approaches by tasks, applications, and challenges, and exploring the influence of advanced techniques like large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graph reasoning is central to enabling advanced reasoning and understanding in cognitive systems but lacks a systematic review covering diverse applications and future challenges.

Method: The survey categorizes KGR approaches by reasoning tasks, downstream applications, and emerging paradigms, while also investigating the impact of advanced technologies like large language models.

Result: A structured overview of KGR tasks, applications, challenges, and integration with cutting-edge technologies is presented, identifying research trends and gaps.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a guiding framework for understanding KGR and its applications, emphasizing advanced techniques and identifying areas for future research.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

### [2] [OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11023)
*Tomas Bueno Momcilovic,Barbara Gallina,Ingmar Kessler,Dian Balta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OntoGSN, an ontology and middleware solution for managing Assurance Cases (ACs) in Goal Structuring Notation (GSN), providing automated, queryable, and maintainable knowledge representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools and methods for managing Assurance Cases (ACs) face challenges in maintaining embedded knowledge during changes, leading to poor management or false confidence. There is a need for better tools to support dynamic AC contexts.

Method: The authors developed OntoGSN, which is a formal OWL ontology for the GSN Community Standard v3 with SWRL rules, an integration parser for existing tools, a query library, and a prototype interface, all evaluated using FAIR principles, OOPS framework, and community feedback.

Result: OntoGSN formalized GSN concepts, integrated successfully with existing AC tools, was validated through evaluations, and showcased its use in dynamic AC management for adversarial robustness in language models.

Conclusion: OntoGSN provides a robust framework for dynamic assurance case management, aligning with community standards and offering tools for easier updates, evaluations, and queries.

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as a Clinical Evaluation Judge with Fuzzy Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11221)
*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge,' a system that uses fuzzy logic and Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate the clinical communication skills of medical students with 80%-90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and automated assessment of medical students' clinical communication skills, while aligning with subjective physician judgment, motivated this study.

Method: The authors fine-tuned LLMs using human-annotated data categorized into four fuzzy sets (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, Contextual Distraction) based on conversations from a medical education system.

Result: The system achieved over 80% overall accuracy and over 90% for major criteria items, showing promise in delivering human-aligned and interpretable assessments.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that combining LLMs with fuzzy logic can support scalable, automated evaluations in medical education, aligned with human preferences, and shows potential as a robust assessment tool.

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

### [4] [MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11331)
*Jihoon Yun,Chengzhang Li,Dhrubojyoti Roy,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUDAS, a framework designed for multi-label sound classification on resource-constrained IoT devices, showcasing significant improvements in urban sound classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA algorithms struggle with multi-label tasks and require high computational resources, making them unsuitable for resource-limited IoT systems in challenging acoustic environments like urban sound classification.

Method: The MUDAS framework selectively retrains classifiers using high-confidence data, employs class-specific adaptive thresholds for pseudo-labeling, and uses diversity regularization to improve accuracy, all while minimizing computational demands.

Result: MUDAS significantly improves classification accuracy on the challenging SONYC Urban Sound Tagging dataset, outperforming existing algorithms in constrained IoT settings.

Conclusion: MUDAS enables robust and efficient multi-label sound classification on IoT devices by addressing domain adaptation challenges with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

### [5] [Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375)
*Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Qingyang Mao,Yucong Luo,Qi Liu,Yupeng Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Deguang Liu,Xin Li,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChemTable, a benchmark for chemical tables, focusing on table recognition and understanding to evaluate multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of benchmarks that consider the multimodal and domain-specific complexity of real-world chemical tables for advancing multimodal large language models' scientific reasoning abilities in chemistry.

Method: The authors curated ChemTable, a dataset from experimental sections of chemical literature with expert annotations, logical layouts, and domain-specific labels. They designed tasks for structure parsing, content extraction, and reasoning-oriented question answering.

Result: The evaluation of multimodal models on ChemTable revealed reasonable performance in basic layout parsing but significant limitations in descriptive and inferential tasks, with notable performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: ChemTable highlights the challenges of chemistry-aware table understanding and serves as a rigorous benchmark for improving multimodal models in scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

### [6] [Large Language Model-Powered Conversational Agent Delivering Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) for Family Caregivers: Enhancing Empathy and Therapeutic Alliance Using In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11376)
*Liying Wang,Ph. D.,Daffodil Carrington,M. S.,Daniil Filienko,M. S.,Caroline El Jazmi,M. S.,Serena Jinchen Xie,M. S.,Martine De Cock,Ph. D.,Sarah Iribarren,Ph. D.,Weichao Yuwen,Ph. D*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates a conversational agent powered by a large language model (LLM) to provide mental health support to family caregivers using advanced therapeutic methods, showcasing its efficacy in empathy and personalized support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Family caregivers face significant mental health burdens due to the complexities of their caregiving roles and lack of adequate resources. This study aims to investigate LLM-powered solutions to address these challenges.

Method: The study utilized a within-subject experiment with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations. Techniques such as Few-Shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and clinician-curated examples were integrated for enhanced performance.

Result: The best-performing LLM configurations demonstrated improved contextual understanding and personalized support. Caregivers rated these models highly on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliance, valuing emotional validation and actionable strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in delivering empathetic and customized mental health support for caregivers but face challenges in balancing comprehensive assessments with efficient advice delivery.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

### [7] [FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419)
*Bin Sun,Boao Zhang,Jiayi Lu,Xinjie Feng,Jiachen Shang,Rui Cao,Mengchao Zheng,Chuanye Wang,Shichun Yang,Yaoguang Cao,Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FocalAD, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework enhancing local motion interactions to improve planning reliability, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitation in current autonomous driving models, which focus on globally aggregated motion features instead of locally critical agents, leading to potential risks in planning reliability.

Method: The paper proposes FocalAD with two main modules: 1) Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) for graph-based interaction with local neighboring agents, and 2) Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss) to emphasize decision-critical agents.

Result: FocalAD shows superior performance over existing autonomous driving models on datasets like nuScenes and Bench2Drive benchmarks, with a notable reduction in collision rate on the Adv-nuScenes dataset by 41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

Conclusion: FocalAD effectively augments end-to-end autonomous driving by prioritizing local interactions, demonstrating improved robustness and planning reliability.

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

### [8] [Resolve Highway Conflict in Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Controls with Local State Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11445)
*Xuan Duy Ta,Bang Giang Le,Thanh Ha Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Local State Attention module to improve decision-making for autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic scenarios using multi-agent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic environments face challenges due to human-controlled vehicles and stochastic events. Existing MARL methods such as Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization struggle with local conflicts and generalization.

Method: A Local State Attention module is integrated into the state representation, leveraging the self-attention operator to prioritize essential information of nearby agents.

Result: Simulation results in a highway merging scenario show improved merging efficiency, especially in high-density traffic scenarios, compared to popular baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed module enhances MARL performance in autonomous vehicles, addressing local conflicts and improving efficiency in complex traffic situations.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

### [9] [Structure-Aware Automatic Channel Pruning by Searching with Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11469)
*Zifan Liu,Yuan Cao,Yanwei Yu,Heng Qi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SACP uses graph convolutional networks for structure-aware, automated channel pruning, improving efficiency and reducing human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing channel pruning methods fail to capture global structural dependencies of networks, leading to inefficiencies and degraded performance.

Method: SACP models network topology with graph convolutional networks, employing topology-aware pruning in a restricted and dynamic search space.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with ResNet and VGG16 show SACP yields superior compression efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: SACP introduces automation and structural-awareness in channel pruning, offering improvements over state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

### [10] [Reviving DSP for Advanced Theorem Proving in the Era of Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11487)
*Chenrui Cao,Liangcheng Song,Zenan Li,Xinyi Le,Xian Zhang,Hui Xue,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents DSP+, an advanced neuro-symbolic framework for theorem proving, achieving high performance without model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore non-training-based approaches to tackle theorem proving, which is traditionally RL-driven, and highlight the potential of neuro-symbolic coordination.

Method: The DSP+ framework improves theorem proving through three phases: neuro-symbolic prompting for subgoals (draft phase), autoformalization and error masking (sketch phase), and integrated symbolic search (proving phase).

Result: DSP+ achieves competitive performance in problem-solving across multiple datasets, uncovers erroneous formalizations, and solves notable problems like IMO 2019 P1.

Conclusion: The success of DSP+ challenges RL-based benchmarks, proving the strength of neuro-symbolic methods, with its results and components made open-source.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

### [11] [RAG+: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Application-Aware Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11555)
*Yu Wang,Shiwan Zhao,Ming Fan,Zhihu Wang,Yubo Zhang,Xicheng Zhang,Zhengfan Wang,Heyuan Huang,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG+, an improved retrieval-augmented generation approach that integrates knowledge retrieval and application, resulting in better performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG models fail to effectively apply retrieved knowledge to task-specific reasoning, creating a gap in achieving comprehensive capabilities.

Method: RAG+ extends the RAG framework by introducing a dual corpus with both knowledge and application examples that are retrieved jointly during the inference process.

Result: RAG+ shows consistent performance improvements of 3-5% on average, with maximum gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios across mathematical, legal, and medical domains.

Conclusion: By focusing on integrating knowledge application into reasoning, RAG+ enhances interpretability, cognitive grounding, and the performance of large language models.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

### [12] [Collaborative LLM Inference via Planning for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11578)
*Byeongchan Lee,Jonghoon Lee,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework where smaller, open-sourced models collaborate with larger, proprietary ones via a multi-round planning process to achieve strong reasoning tasks, reducing cost in test-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between the high cost of proprietary large models and the limited reasoning capabilities of smaller, freely available models.

Method: Developing a test-time collaboration framework where a planner model generates high-level plans to guide a reasoner model through multi-round cascades for collaboratively solving tasks.

Result: The proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to proprietary models, minimizing dependence on paid inference systems.

Conclusion: Planning is demonstrated as an effective and practical approach for balancing cost and inference capabilities in real-world scenarios through cross-model collaboration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

### [13] [VLM@school -- Evaluation of AI image understanding on German middle school knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11604)
*René Peinl,Vincent Tischler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a German language benchmark designed for Vision Language Models (VLMs), focusing on tasks requiring visual and subject-specific reasoning. Evaluation shows VLMs perform poorly, particularly in music and mathematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks that rigorously test VLM capabilities in combining visual reasoning and domain-specific knowledge in non-English contexts.

Method: Developed a dataset of 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, derived from middle school curricula across nine domains, and evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs.

Result: Even top-performing VLMs achieve less than 45% accuracy overall, with significant issues in music, mathematics, and adversarial questions, exposing a gap between benchmark success and real-world understanding.

Conclusion: Middle school-level tasks and non-English datasets can offer valuable insights for improving VLMs, highlighting current limitations and guiding future advancements.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

### [14] [Mitigating Hallucination Through Theory-Consistent Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11712)
*Wenqi Liu,Xuemeng Song,Jiaxi Li,Yinwei Wei,Na Zheng,Jianhua Yin,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO) to enhance visual understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly optimizing symmetric preference learning, improving upon existing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs rely on indirect preference supervision and non-rigorous optimization objectives, which limit their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed SymMPO introduces a symmetric preference learning approach with direct supervision using response pairs. It also incorporates a preference margin consistency loss for precise regulation of preference gaps while maintaining theoretical alignment with DPO.

Result: Across five benchmarks, SymMPO demonstrates superior performance in reducing hallucination and enhancing visual understanding in MLLMs.

Conclusion: SymMPO offers a theoretically rigorous and effective approach to address shortcomings in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs, showcasing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

### [15] [Relational GNNs Cannot Learn $C_2$ Features for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11721)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper finds that Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features in planning, despite theoretical and empirical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the ability of R-GNNs to learn value functions in planning domains that are defined by $C_2$ features.

Method: Analytical exploration of the theoretical connection between R-GNNs and $C_2$ logic, with evaluations of R-GNNs' limitations and comparisons to alternative GNN architectures.

Result: R-GNNs are shown to be incapable of learning value functions decomposable into $C_2$ features, contradicting previous empirical observations.

Conclusion: R-GNNs are not suitable for learning value functions defined by $C_2$ features, and alternative GNN architectures might perform better in this context.

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

*Yaroslav Kivva,Sina Akbari,Saber Salehkaleybar,Negar Kiyavash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect estimation in the presence of latent confounders using multi-environment data and introduces a moment-based estimation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating causal effects when latent confounders are present, particularly when data is collected from multiple environments.

Method: The authors propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating causal effects and introduce a procedure to identify variations in the data-generating mechanism across environments.

Result: Identifiability of causal effects was shown to be possible under certain conditions, and the methods were validated through experiments on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Causal effects can be estimated in multi-environment settings under controlled variations, but identifiability is compromised if multiple parameters vary simultaneously.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

*Margot Geerts,Manon Reusens,Bart Baesens,Seppe vanden Broucke,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper assesses the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to estimate house prices using optimized prompting techniques and evaluates their effectiveness compared to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information asymmetry in the real estate market and explore whether LLMs can democratize access to interpretive house price insights.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs on international housing datasets using prompting strategies like zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid techniques, while analyzing their ability to use hedonic variables.

Result: LLMs demonstrate meaningful predictions using property features and offer an accessible and interpretative alternative to traditional models; however, they struggle with spatial reasoning and overconfidence in price intervals.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in enhancing the transparency and accessibility of real estate appraisals, yielding actionable insights for stakeholders despite limitations in certain predictive dimensions.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

*Aishwarya Bandaru,Fabian Bindley,Trevor Bluth,Nandini Chavda,Baixu Chen,Ethan Law*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines political bias in debates using large language models (LLMs) with different political and gender attributes, finding that Neutral agents align with Democrats, gender influences adaptiveness, and echo chambers occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the political biases and interaction dynamics of large language models (LLMs) in simulated debates, as these aspects are under-researched.

Method: A structured multi-agent debate framework was employed, featuring Neutral, Republican, and Democrat LLM agents discussing politically sensitive topics, while varying LLM types, agent genders, and debate formats.

Result: Neutral agents lean Democratic, Republicans adjust closer to Neutral stances, gender awareness influences adaptability of opinions, and political echo chambers intensify attitudes over debates.

Conclusion: The research highlights that political and gender attributes of LLMs significantly affect debate dynamics, with pronounced Democratic leanings, gender-influenced adaptiveness, and evidence of echo chambers in politically aligned agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates demographic biases in LLM-based systems and proposes a privacy-focused framework to mitigate gender bias, using automated recruitment as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ethical concerns, such as demographic biases and privacy issues, in the growing use of LLMs in high-stake applications like recruitment.

Method: The authors propose a privacy-enhancing framework aimed at reducing gender information during training to mitigate bias. They analyze the effect of data biases across systems based on two different LLMs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the framework significantly prevents systems from inheriting and reproducing gender biases present in the data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of privacy-enhancing strategies in mitigating demographic biases in LLM-based systems, thereby making them more ethical and fair.

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

### [20] [Towards a Cascaded LLM Framework for Cost-effective Human-AI Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11887)
*Claudio Fanconi,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cascaded LLM decision framework to balance correctness, cost, and confidence in human-AI decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a decision-making framework that balances prediction accuracy, reasoning complexity cost, and confidence about abstaining from automated answers.

Method: The framework uses two stages: deferral policy for answer selection and abstention policy for human intervention, with online learning to improve quality.

Result: The framework improves accuracy while reducing costs and handles abstentions better compared to single-model baselines across general and medical question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: The cascaded approach is effective in optimizing AI decision-making while minimizing costs and leveraging human input for continuous improvement.

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

*Wuzhenghong Wen,Su Pan,yuwei Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Schema-R1, a novel model to enhance reasoning in schema linking for Text-to-SQL, using reinforcement learning and showing a significant improvement in filter accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current schema linking approaches overly optimize for rote-learning of ground truth outcomes, limiting reasoning abilities due to the lack of high-quality reasoning samples.

Method: Schema-R1 employs three steps: small batches of high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for initialization, and rule-based reinforcement learning training.

Result: Schema-R1 achieves a 10% improvement in filter accuracy for schema linking tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning-driven Schema-R1 enhances reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL schema linking, addressing limitations of prior fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

*Xiaopeng Yuan,Xingjian Zhang,Ke Xu,Yifan Xu,Lijun Yu,Jindong Wang,Yushun Dong,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of their reasoning processes, using strategic games as an assessment environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are increasingly applied to tasks needing complex reasoning, current benchmarks often overlook internal reasoning processes. The study aims to develop measures for planning, revision, and decision-making under constraints to better understand model behavior and enhance their reliability.

Method: The authors propose evaluating LLMs through strategic games that simulate closed rule-based systems. They define metrics like overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and over-budget ratio to measure reasoning processes without relying solely on win rates.

Result: Among 4320 game rounds and 12 models tested, ChatGPT-o3-mini performed the best with a 74.7% win rate and a 78.6% correction success rate. Qwen-Plus exhibited high overcorrection but underperformed in win rate due to heavy resource use. A negative correlation between overcorrection risk and correction success was observed, indicating frequent edits do not always yield better outcomes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of analyzing how LLMs arrive at decisions, not just their results. It underscores the importance of understanding internal reasoning mechanisms to improve LLM performance and reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address inconsistencies in evaluation results for reasoning models, aiming to enhance reproducibility and reliability in model performance claims.

Method: Empirical studies were conducted on Deepseek-R1-Distill series and other related models to investigate the underlying causes of benchmark result fluctuations.

Result: Fluctuations in evaluation outcomes were confirmed, indicating that subtle changes in assessment conditions might significantly impact measured performance.

Conclusion: The authors propose designing a more rigorous evaluation paradigm to ensure reliable and reproducible benchmarks for reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper explores unexplored LLC contentions in Intel Xeon CPUs caused by high-bandwidth I/O devices, presenting a runtime LLC management framework to alleviate contention and boost workload performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the issue of significant LLC contention caused by high-bandwidth network-I/O devices in Intel Xeon CPUs, which disrupts co-running workloads and emphasizes exploring hidden microarchitectural properties to better manage these challenges.

Method: The paper uncovers two LLC contention mechanisms (related to DCA-written cache line migration and storage-I/O contention) and proposes a runtime LLC management framework called \design that exploits a hidden knob and existing CPU hardware features to optimize LLC performance.

Result: \design improves latency-sensitive, high-priority workload performance by 51% without significantly affecting low-priority workloads, mitigating previously known and newly identified LLC contention issues.

Conclusion: The proposed \design runtime LLC management framework effectively addresses both known and newly identified LLC contentions in server CPUs, striking a balance between latency-sensitive and low-priority workloads.

Abstract: In modern server CPUs, the Last-Level Cache (LLC) serves not only as a victim
cache for higher-level private caches but also as a buffer for low-latency DMA
transfers between CPU cores and I/O devices through Direct Cache Access (DCA).
However, prior work has shown that high-bandwidth network-I/O devices can
rapidly flood the LLC with packets, often causing significant contention with
co-running workloads. One step further, this work explores hidden
microarchitectural properties of the Intel Xeon CPUs, uncovering two previously
unrecognized LLC contentions triggered by emerging high-bandwidth I/O devices.
Specifically, (C1) DMA-written cache lines in LLC ways designated for DCA
(referred to as DCA ways) are migrated to certain LLC ways (denoted as
inclusive ways) when accessed by CPU cores, unexpectedly contending with
non-I/O cache lines within the inclusive ways. In addition, (C2) high-bandwidth
storage-I/O devices, which are increasingly common in datacenter servers,
benefit little from DCA while contending with (latency-sensitive) network-I/O
devices within DCA ways. To this end, we present \design, a runtime LLC
management framework designed to alleviate both (C1) and (C2) among diverse
co-running workloads, using a hidden knob and other hardware features
implemented in those CPUs. Additionally, we demonstrate that \design can also
alleviate other previously known network-I/O-driven LLC contentions. Overall,
it improves the performance of latency-sensitive, high-priority workloads by
51\% without notably compromising that of low-priority workloads.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPUV4E for AMD's Versal ACAP architecture to optimize memory bandwidth and computational efficiency, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional FPGA-based designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the memory bandwidth limitations of AMD's Versal ACAP architecture to effectively utilize the computational power of AI Engines while solving the resource inefficiency of traditional FPGAs.

Method: DPUV4E is designed with configurable processing elements (PEs), Conv PE and DWC PE, which utilize efficient data flow architectures to address bandwidth issues. Non-convolutional computations are assigned to AI Engines to reduce overhead.

Result: The proposed design achieves a $8.6\times$ increase in TOPS/W compared to traditional FPGA DPUs, reduces DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$. Improved throughput is noted, with $2.2\times$ for depth-wise convolution models and $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Conclusion: DPUV4E effectively addresses Versal ACAP’s limitations, showcasing improvements in energy efficiency, computational utilization, and throughput. The design proves to be a benchmark for AI acceleration for heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces vNPU, a virtualization design for inter-core connected Neural Processing Units (NPUs) to address inefficiencies in hardware resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inter-core connected NPUs face challenges in resource utilization balance across tasks due to their hardware demands, with prior solutions neglecting these NPUs' topology.

Method: The design incorporates three techniques: route virtualization, memory virtualization, and best-effort topology mapping to optimize virtual topology and performance.

Result: vNPU achieves up to 2x performance improvement compared to alternative virtualization methods like MIG and unified virtual memory, with minimal hardware cost.

Conclusion: vNPU offers an innovative, scalable virtualization approach for inter-core connected NPUs, effectively improving performance and resource utilization at low overhead.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, an
emerging class of AI accelerators, termed Inter-core Connected Neural
Processing Units (NPU), has been adopted in both cloud and edge computing
environments, like Graphcore IPU, Tenstorrent, etc. Despite their innovative
design, these NPUs often demand substantial hardware resources, leading to
suboptimal resource utilization due to the imbalance of hardware requirements
across various tasks. To address this issue, prior research has explored
virtualization techniques for monolithic NPUs, but has neglected inter-core
connected NPUs with the hardware topology.
  This paper introduces vNPU, the first comprehensive virtualization design for
inter-core connected NPUs, integrating three novel techniques: (1) NPU route
virtualization, which redirects instruction and data flow from virtual NPU
cores to physical ones, creating a virtual topology; (2) NPU memory
virtualization, designed to minimize translation stalls for SRAM-centric and
NoC-equipped NPU cores, thereby maximizing the memory bandwidth; and (3)
Best-effort topology mapping, which determines the optimal mapping from all
candidate virtual topologies, balancing resource utilization with end-to-end
performance. We have developed a prototype of vNPU on both an FPGA platform
(Chipyard+FireSim) and a simulator (DCRA). Evaluation results indicate that,
compared to other virtualization approaches such as unified virtual memory and
MIG, vNPU achieves up to a 2x performance improvement across various ML models,
with only 2% hardware cost.

TL;DR: FractalSync is a hardware solution for synchronization in AI accelerators, providing up to 43x speedup with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow progress in technology scaling and the rise of AI workloads demand efficient synchronization mechanisms in many-core platforms.

Method: FractalSync integrates a hardware barrier synchronization mechanism within MAGIA—an AI accelerator with tiles featuring RISC-V, MatMul units, and DMA connected to a mesh NoC.

Result: The proposed solution demonstrated up to 43x faster synchronization compared to software alternatives and minimal area overhead (<0.01%).

Conclusion: FractalSync enhances BSP synchronization at high frequencies, solving key challenges in scalable AI accelerator designs.

Abstract: The slow-down of technology scaling and the emergence of Artificial

exploit parallelization coupled with hardware acceleration to keep pushing the
performance envelope. However, this solution comes with the challenge of
synchronization of processing elements (PEs) in massive heterogeneous many-core

accelerated synchronization mechanism for Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)
systems. We integrate FractalSync in MAGIA, a scalable tile-based AI
accelerator, with each tile featuring a RISC-V-coupled matrix-multiplication
(MatMul) accelerator, scratchpad memory (SPM), and a DMA connected to a global
mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC). We study the scalability of the proposed barrier
synchronization scheme on tile meshes ranging from 2x2 PEs to 16x16 PEs to
evaluate its design boundaries. Compared to a synchronization scheme based on
software atomic memory operations (AMOs), the proposed solution achieves up to
43x speedup on synchronization, introducing a negligible area overhead
(<0.01%). FractalSync closes timing at MAGIA's target 1GHz frequency.

*M. Manzour,Catherine M. Elias,Omar M. Shehata,R. Izquierdo,M. A. Sotelo*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-world lane-change prediction system using Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference, validated on experimental hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between algorithmic advances in lane-change prediction and their deployment in real-world scenarios, ensuring practical safety for vehicles on the road.

Method: The system integrates a perception module for sensing and feature extraction and a prediction module employing KGE and Bayesian inference to anticipate vehicle maneuvers. A longitudinal braking action ensures safety.

Result: The system successfully predicts lane changes of a target vehicle 3-4 seconds in advance during real-world hardware tests, allowing sufficient reaction time for safety.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using KGEs and Bayesian inference for practical, hardware-validated lane-change prediction systems.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

*Yanyan Wang,Yingying Wang,Junli Liang,Yin Xu,Yunlong Liu,Yiming Xu,Zhengwang Jiang,Zhehe Li,Fei Li,Long Zhao,Kuang Xu,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleEval-OS, the first Telecommunications Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark, featuring 15 datasets to assess LLMs across four key operational stages. Open-source LLMs are shown to excel in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the lack of evaluation benchmarks and explore the application potential of large language models specifically in the domain of telecommunications operation scheduling.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark called TeleEval-OS with 15 datasets and 13 subtasks simulating four operational stages. They also develop a hierarchical capability framework to systematically evaluate LLMs across varying complexities through zero-shot and few-shot methods.

Result: Experimental results reveal that open-source LLMs can, in some scenarios, outperform closed-source LLMs, showcasing their potential in solving telecommunications operation tasks.

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS proves valuable in comprehensively assessing LLM performance and underscores the promise of open-source models in complex, domain-specific tasks like telecommunications operation scheduling.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores position bias in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, showing performance instability based on evidence order, especially in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the order of retrieved evidence affects performance in multimodal and open-domain systems, which suffer from position sensitivity and bias, especially as retrieval complexity increases.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to analyze position bias in text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality RAG tasks. Introduced the Position Sensitivity Index (PSIp) and a visualization framework to study attention allocation in decoder layers.

Result: Finds that position bias causes a U-shaped accuracy curve. Multimodal interactions amplify this bias compared to unimodal setups, and the bias grows logarithmically with the retrieval range.

Conclusion: Reordering or debiasing strategies are necessary to mitigate position bias and improve the robustness of multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines Russenorsk, a historical pidgin language, using large language models to create a structured dictionary, analyze linguistic rules, and generate hypothetical translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to deepen the understanding of Russenorsk's linguistic structure and its historical significance by leveraging modern AI tools, as the language lacks extensive prior documentation.

Method: They construct a lexicon from literary sources, group words by synonyms and origins, test hypotheses using LLMs, and develop an AI-based translation agent for generating Russenorsk text.

Result: The analysis aligns some LLM-generated hypotheses with previously proposed academic ones, and the translation agent offers insights into reconstructing Russenorsk.

Conclusion: Russenorsk can be partially recreated and analyzed using LLMs, aiding in its study and illustrating LLMs' potential for historical linguistics.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

TL;DR: The paper presents a cost-effective LLM-based pipeline to extract ROS entities from clinical notes, achieving competitive accuracy with both ChatGPT and open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to alleviate the burden of Review of Systems (ROS) documentation in healthcare by automating the extraction of ROS entities from clinical notes using affordable and scalable language models.

Method: The approach involved using SecTag to extract ROS sections, followed by few-shot learning with different LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma, and ChatGPT) to identify ROS entity spans, their statuses, and body systems. The pipeline was tested on clinical notes annotated with ROS entities.

Result: The pipeline integrating ChatGPT achieved the lowest error rates for ROS span detection (28.2%) and status/system identification (14.5%). Open-source LLMs were cost-effective and delivered competitive performance with slightly higher error rates (spans: 30.5-36.7%, status/system: 24.3-27.3%).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline minimizes the workload related to ROS documentation and supports scalability. Open-source LLMs are highlighted as practical solutions for low-resource healthcare settings, offering similar performance to commercial models like ChatGPT.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [34] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a bias (Deontological Keyword Bias) toward interpreting contexts with modal expressions (e.g., 'must' or 'ought to') as obligations, often incorrectly, and a methodology is proposed to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates how LLMs make obligation judgments in contexts where moral criteria are ambiguous, highlighting the underexplored issue of modal expressions influencing these judgments.

Method: Modal expressions were tested across different scenarios, LLM types, and formats to observe judgment tendencies. A mitigation strategy using few-shot examples and reasoning prompts was introduced.

Result: LLMs judged over 90% of contexts with modal expressions as obligations, regardless of model family or context type.

Conclusion: Modal expressions strongly influence LLM normative judgment, necessitating mitigation strategies to reduce bias and improve ethical alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interface architecture to enable targeted control of prototype models with natural language instructions, addressing issues between designers' and modeling languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial designers struggle with intuitive model control due to gaps between their natural language and complex modeling languages.

Method: The authors propose an interface architecture based on principles from fast prototyping practices and develop an automated algorithm for domain specification.

Result: Both machine-based evaluations and human studies confirm the interface's capability for precise and effective prototype model control across diverse product design domains.

Conclusion: The proposed interface has significant potential as a module for Large Language Models, bridging language gaps and enhancing the modeling process for designers.

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAIM, a method to reduce multilingual object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) without the need for resource-intensive training, by aligning cross-modal attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of multilingual object hallucination in LVLMs, which exacerbates when non-English queries are used, and improve the alignment of responses with visual inputs across languages without resource-heavy solutions.

Method: CLAIM identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, calculates language shift vectors, and intervenes in attention outputs during inference to align visual understanding across different languages.

Result: CLAIM significantly improves performance on multilingual benchmarks, achieving a 13.56% average improvement on POPE and 21.75% on hallucination subsets of MME, with up to 30% improvement in Spanish.

Conclusion: CLAIM demonstrates that aligning cross-modal attention during inference is effective in reducing multilingual object hallucination and highlights the importance of intermediate layers in multilingual attention divergence.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces reflection tokens as a regulatory mechanism to optimize reasoning performance in large models, proposing a novel cyclical scheduling strategy that improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of balancing test-time compute performance and reasoning quality in large reasoning models (LRMs), especially the trade-offs caused by overuse or underuse of reflection tokens.

Method: The authors propose CyclicReflex, a decoding strategy that employs a triangular waveform-based scheduling method to dynamically adjust reflection token logits depending on position.

Result: Experiments on datasets like MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 show consistent performance improvements across LRMs of different sizes, outperforming methods such as TIP and S1.

Conclusion: Dynamic modulation of reflection tokens via CyclicReflex optimizes model performance without the degradation seen in over-reflection or under-reflection, making it a valuable enhancement for complex problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces RoE-FND, a training-free framework, to improve Fake News Detection by reframing it as a logical deduction task using experiential learning and Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing evidence-based Fake News Detection systems, such as noisy evidence selection, poor generalization, and unclear decision-making processes, along with challenges posed by the use of LLMs.

Method: The RoE-FND framework operates in two stages: self-reflective knowledge building to analyze past reasoning errors, and dynamic criterion retrieval to synthesize reasoning guidelines from historical cases. It uses a dual-channel procedure for rationale validation.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate RoE-FND’s superior generalization and effectiveness over current state-of-the-art methods across three datasets.

Conclusion: RoE-FND is an innovative framework that overcomes existing challenges in Fake News Detection, offering adaptability and improved decision-making through logical deduction and case-based reasoning.

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANBench, a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in comparison to human performance across nine tasks. MLLMs show strengths in knowledge and text-image tasks but struggle with complex cross-modal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs with human performance in a structured and rigorous manner, highlighting their strengths and limitations in multimodal tasks.

Method: Development of a bilingual benchmark named MANBench with 1,314 questions covering nine tasks across multiple domains. Conducted human experiments to compare performance with MLLMs, focusing on both knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based domains.

Result: The results reveal that MLLMs excel in knowledge tasks but perform poorly in deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks like Transmorphic Understanding and Multi-image Understanding. Both humans and MLLMs face challenges in tasks with high complexity, such as puzzles.

Conclusion: While MLLMs demonstrate notable capabilities, they are still far from achieving human-level performance across many multimodal tasks. MANBench serves as a tool to identify gaps and foster progress in closing this gap.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-time, energy-efficient use in specialized medical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, for healthcare applications, despite their typical large size.

Method: The framework measures neuron saliency on domain-specific data, prunes irrelevant neurons, applies post-training quantization, and evaluates model performance across medical tasks.

Result: Achieved 50% compression of Gemma and 67% compression of LLaMA3, which were deployed on devices like Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, showing real-time performance under hardware constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows effective and energy-efficient LLM deployment in medical scenarios, bridging the gap between large-scale models and practical use on constrained devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate claims that LLMs exhibit emergent capabilities and intelligence, inspired by complexity science concepts.

Method: Review approaches to quantifying emergence and assess intelligence within LLMs.

Result: Analysis of emergence and models suggesting whether LLMs display intelligence as an emergent property.

Conclusion: LLMs potentially show emergent capabilities and may possess emergent intelligence as defined by framework in complexity science.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents 'SAGE,' a novel method leveraging LLMs combined with reinforcement learning for inducing Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) from natural language specifications, significantly improving grammar validity and test effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating valid and general grammars from natural language specifications is challenging, especially under limited supervision, and critical for effective grammar-based test case generation for competitive programming problems.

Method: The authors fine-tuned an open-source large language model (LLM) to translate specifications into CCFGs and used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve grammar validity and generalization. They also incorporated iterative feedback to correct errors in generated grammars.

Result: The proposed method, SAGE, achieved improvements of 15.92%p in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness, outperforming 17 open and closed-source LLMs and surpassing the previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLMs and reinforcement learning for grammar induction, offering a more generalizable and higher-quality approach to generating grammars for competitive programming.

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our

*Lionel Levine,John Santerre,Alex S. Young,T. Barry Levine,Francis Campion,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a transformer-based model designed to predict and model sequential clinical decision events effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional diagnostic classification methods and improve predictive modeling of sequential clinical decision-making.

Method: The paper uses PRISM, a transformer-based architecture with tokenized sequences of medical events and an autoregressive training objective.

Result: PRISM outperforms random baselines in next-token prediction tasks, generating realistic diagnostic and procedural pathways.

Conclusion: Generative language modeling can be successfully applied to structured medical event data to aid clinical decision-making and education, paving the way for advancements in healthcare modeling.

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

### [44] [RedDebate: Safer Responses through Multi-Agent Red Teaming Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11083)
*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RedDebate, an automated multi-agent debate framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and mitigate unsafe behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety methods rely heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated model assessments, which are difficult to scale and prone to oversight risks.

Method: RedDebate enables adversarial debates among LLMs for automated red-teaming and introduces long-term memory modules to retain safety insights.

Result: The framework reduces unsafe behaviors by 17.7% through debate alone, and over 23.5% when integrated with long-term memory modules.

Conclusion: RedDebate is the first automated framework combining multi-agent debates and red-teaming to enhance AI safety without human intervention.

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

*Pengbo Wang,Chaozhuo Li,Chenxu Wang,Liwen Zheng,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) by proposing a unified framework, SPACE, to jointly improve factuality and faithfulness using shared activation subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to alleviate persistent hallucination problems in LLMs—specifically factuality and faithfulness—which hinder their practical deployment.

Method: The proposed method, SPACE, uses dual-task feature modeling to establish geometric foundations for shared subspace existence, and employs a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and attention head saliency to edit these subspaces.

Result: Experimental results show that SPACE outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating hallucination trade-offs.

Conclusion: SPACE demonstrates that hallucination issues in LLMs can be jointly addressed using activation subspace editing, offering new insights and improved performance.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

### [46] [Customizing Speech Recognition Model with Large Language Model Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11091)
*Shaoshi Ling,Guoli Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs) to improve ASR systems' recognition of rare named entities and domain-specific terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with rare named entities and domain-specific terms despite excelling in general transcription, while LLMs handle diverse domains better due to large-scale internet training.

Method: The approach uses reinforcement learning where an LLM provides a reward signal to fine-tune the ASR model based on contextually scored hypotheses, leveraging unlabeled data.

Result: The proposed method improves entity word error rate by 21% compared to traditional self-training methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLM-based feedback via reinforcement learning significantly enhances ASR systems' ability to adapt to domain mismatches and handle rare named entities.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

### [47] [Dynamic Context Tuning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing Multi-Turn Planning and Tool Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11092)
*Jubin Abhishek Soni,Amit Anand,Rajesh Kumar Pandey,Aniket Abhishek Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT) enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool settings without retraining, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are limited to static, single-turn interactions and fixed toolsets, making them unsuitable for domains where contexts evolve, such as healthcare and smart homes.

Method: DCT employs an attention-based context cache to track past dialogue, LoRA-based retrieval for dynamic tool selection, and context compression to fit within LLM limits, all without retraining.

Result: DCT improves plan accuracy by 14%, reduces hallucinations by 37%, and matches GPT-4 performance at lower costs, while generalizing to new tools.

Conclusion: DCT provides a scalable framework for adaptable AI assistants in dynamic environments, extending RAG's capabilities to multi-turn conversations and flexible tool adaptation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys recent advancements in evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs), categorizing tasks, metrics, and tools while addressing challenges and suggesting future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of LLMs has raised safety concerns due to their potential for generating toxic and biased content. This survey aims to systematically review efforts in evaluating these safety risks.

Method: The paper categorizes safety evaluation efforts into "Why evaluate," "What to evaluate," "Where to evaluate," and "How to evaluate." It compiles tasks, datasets, metrics, and evaluation toolkits used in the domain.

Result: The survey categorizes existing work in safety evaluation, highlighting tasks like toxicity and bias detection, the tools used, and current benchmarks and methodologies.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety evaluations for LLMs and identifies challenges while suggesting future directions to improve this research area.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

*Manuel D. S. Hopp,Vincent Labatut,Arthur Amalvy,Richard Dufour,Hannah Stone,Hayley Jach,Kou Murayama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computational framework to model reader curiosity by analyzing semantic information gaps in texts using topic modeling and persistent homology, achieving strong prediction results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding reader curiosity is vital for enhancing textual engagement but remains underexplored in natural language processing.

Method: They quantify semantic information gaps by leveraging BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology techniques to analyze the semantic topology in texts, correlating features with curiosity ratings.

Result: Using topological features as predictors, their model achieved 73% explained deviance in curiosity prediction, significantly outperforming a baseline model.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides an innovative approach to examining text structure and its impact on reader engagement, with validated predictive capabilities for curiosity.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

### [50] [C-SEO Bench: Does Conversational SEO Work?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11097)
*Haritz Puerto,Martin Gubri,Tommaso Green,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-SEO Bench, a benchmark to evaluate conversational search engine optimization (C-SEO) methods across tasks, domains, and actor numbers. It finds current C-SEO methods largely ineffective, suggesting traditional SEO strategies perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of conversational search engines (CSE) propelled by large language models (LLMs) has shifted traditional SEO into C-SEO. This shift requires an understanding of whether C-SEO methods are effective across diverse domains and competitive scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced C-SEO Bench, a benchmark for evaluating C-SEO methods across varying tasks (e.g., question answering, product recommendation), domains, and competitive adoption rates. They test these methods quantitatively while simulating multi-actor adoption scenarios.

Result: Experiments showed that most C-SEO methods underperformed compared to traditional SEO strategies. Additionally, as more actors adopted C-SEO, the effectiveness of these strategies declined, exposing the congested and zero-sum nature of the field.

Conclusion: Current C-SEO techniques fail to achieve significant gains, and traditional SEO strategies remain more effective in conversational search contexts. The study highlights potential limitations in C-SEO strategies as adoption saturates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

*Jiachen Zhu,Menghui Zhu,Renting Rui,Rong Shan,Congmin Zheng,Bo Chen,Yunjia Xi,Jianghao Lin,Weiwen Liu,Ruiming Tang,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured framework to differentiate AI agents from traditional large language models (LLMs) like chatbots, providing evaluation benchmarks and future guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of clarity in distinguishing LLM chatbots and advanced AI agents in existing evaluation frameworks, which complicates benchmark selection for researchers.

Method: It proposes a detailed analytical framework based on five distinguishing aspects and categorizes evaluation benchmarks with attributes for a systematic assessment.

Result: The paper presents reference tables summarizing evaluation attributes and categorizes benchmarks while synthesizing trends and methodologies for future evaluations.

Conclusion: The work aids researchers by offering clear frameworks and actionable guidance for selecting and applying benchmarks, promoting progress in AI agent evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

### [52] [You Only Fine-tune Once: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-Tuning for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11103)
*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL), a novel technique that improves the in-context learning performance of large language models (LLMs) and narrows the gap between in-context fine-tuning and dedicated fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the performance limitations of few-shot in-context fine-tuning in LLMs, which have shown potential but still fall short compared to task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: The proposed method, ManyICL, transitions to a many-shot setting and uses a novel objective that treats all answers in the context as supervised training targets, optimizing autoregressive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that ManyICL surpasses zero/few-shot fine-tuning across various tasks, including classification, summarization, and question answering, while reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: ManyICL is an effective and efficient alternative to boosting the performance of LLM-based in-context learning, nearly matching dedicated fine-tuning and introducing a generalizable framework for multiple tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

### [53] [DAM: Dynamic Attention Mask for Long-Context Large Language Model Inference Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11104)
*Hanzhi Zhang,Heng Fan,Kewei Sha,Yan Huang,Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DAM, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism for transformers that adapts masks dynamically to improve long-context understanding efficiency, reducing computational overhead while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges with efficiency in long-context understanding due to quadratic self-attention complexity. Sparse methods with static masks fail to capture diverse attention patterns, limiting retrieval accuracy.

Method: Introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level to preserve heterogeneous patterns without predefined or static mask structures.

Result: The proposed method achieves alignment with full-attention models with minimal performance loss, reduces memory and compute requirements, and ensures scalability for Large Language Models.

Conclusion: DAM offers a scalable and efficient alternative to full attention in transformers, enhancing practical deployment for large-scale NLP applications without compromising performance.

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

### [54] [Graph-based RAG Enhancement via Global Query Disambiguation and Dependency-Aware Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11106)
*Ningyuan Li,Junrui Liu,Yi Shan,Minghui Huang,Tong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG improves graph-based retrieval-augmented generation by addressing the issues of entity-only reliance and hallucination risks, leveraging hierarchical query resolution and dependency-aware reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods face challenges due to their dependence on entity extraction, which can omit latent critical relations, leading to irrelevant or contradictory retrievals.

Method: PankRAG utilizes a hierarchical query-resolution approach combined with a dependency-aware reranking strategy to refine retrieval processes and improve structured reasoning.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate PankRAG’s superior performance over state-of-the-art RAG frameworks across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: PankRAG enhances the fidelity and reliability of generated responses, showing robustness and generalizability for complex retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

TL;DR: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC extends a self-supervised framework for multi-turn dialogue and chain-of-thought reasoning using vLLM's runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize multi-turn dialogue interactions and chain-of-thought reasoning by extending the single-turn capabilities of the existing CAGSR framework.

Method: Instrumented vLLM kernels to track cross-attention weights, then generalized a self-supervised reward function for dialogue and reasoning tasks.

Result: Achieved an adaptation of the CAGSR framework to support broader contexts in dialogues and reasoning, while addressing challenges like attention collapse.

Conclusion: The extended framework effectively handles complex tasks like multi-turn dialogues and chain-of-thought reasoning, offering future potential for hierarchical and multi-party contexts.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

### [56] [Enhancing Large Language Models for Mobility Analytics with Semantic Location Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11109)
*Yile Chen,Yicheng Tao,Yue Jiang,Shuai Liu,Han Yu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes QT-Mob, a framework enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics by introducing semantically rich location tokens and complementary fine-tuning objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to address limitations in current methods for mobility data modeling, which lack robust semantic representation for locations and strong mobility signal modeling within LLMs.

Method: QT-Mob uses a location tokenization module to create compact, meaningful tokens for locations and introduces complementary fine-tuning objectives to align these tokens with the internal structures of LLMs.

Result: The framework improves mobility data interpretation and demonstrates superior results in next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks across three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: QT-Mob provides a generalizable solution for mobility analytics tasks, outperforming existing deep learning and LLM-based models.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

### [57] [AssertBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Self-Assertion in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11110)
*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AssertBench, a benchmark to test how directional framing of true statements impacts Large Language Models (LLMs) agreement and reasoning, focusing on whether they maintain consistent truth evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the framing of factually true statements impacts model agreement and reasoning, addressing the knowledge gap in this area for LLM users.

Method: The authors sampled evidence-supported facts from the FEVEROUS dataset and created two prompts with varied framing, asking models to evaluate the same fact in contradicting contexts. They measured if models consistently asserted truth across framings.

Result: AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability, scoring LLMs based on their factual knowledge neutrality, and evaluates their consistency in truth evaluation.

Conclusion: The benchmark tests an LLM's ability to maintain consistent truth evaluation, preventing it from aligning reasoning to contradictory user claims, thereby offering insights into model robustness.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and ensure the robustness of LLMs for their increasingly critical role in AI applications, tackling challenges such as toxic prompts, limited domain data, and unexpected scenarios.

Method: The paper reviews robustness based on adversarial inputs, out-of-distribution scenarios, and methods to evaluate robustness, offering a formal definition, research discussions, and curated resources.

Result: The survey organizes existing works in the field, categorizes robustness issues, provides evaluation tools, and identifies gaps and opportunities for future research in LLM robustness.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a comprehensive understanding of LLM robustness, creating a foundation for further advancements and emphasizes the importance of addressing these challenges to improve the reliability of AI applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while LLMs show promise in automating peer reviews, addressing their susceptibility to adversarial attacks is critical to maintain the integrity of scholarly communication.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KokushiMD-10 introduces a multimodal benchmark from Japanese healthcare licensing exams, addressing gaps in healthcare AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate large language models comprehensively across diverse healthcare roles and multimodal reasoning tasks.

Method: Developed KokushiMD-10, using 10 Japanese licensing exams with 11588 questions incorporating both text and images and tested over 30 LLMs.

Result: No model consistently meets passing thresholds across domains, showcasing challenges in medical AI performance.

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10 serves as a focused benchmark for multilingual and multimodal clinical AI advancements.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

*Yerim Oh,Jun-Hyung Park,Junho Kim,SungHo Kim,SangKeun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATTER improves tokenization in materials science by preserving material-specific concepts, enhancing task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inadequate tokenization methods for materials science text, which leads to fragmentation and semantic loss when processed with language models.

Method: MATTER integrates material knowledge into tokenization using MatDetector, a re-ranking method, and a materials knowledge base to preserve material concept integrity.

Result: Experimental results show an average performance gain of 4% in generation tasks and 2% in classification tasks compared to existing tokenization methods.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-specific knowledge significantly improves tokenization strategies for scientific text, preserving semantic integrity and enhancing performance in language model tasks.

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

*Jijie Li,Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Bo-wen Zhang,Liangdong Wang,Boyan Gao,Guang Liu,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality dataset for improving large language models' foundational and chat capabilities. It achieves notable performance gains compared to proprietary models and has been publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap between open-source LLMs and proprietary models, which arises from the lack of comprehensive open-source instruction datasets.

Method: A two-phase pipeline is employed: Phase 1 curates 7.4M foundational instructions using hybrid data selection, and Phase 2 synthesizes 1.5M chat instructions through a two-stage process involving selection, evolution, and filtering.

Result: Models fine-tuned using Infinity-Instruct demonstrate substantial performance improvements, with InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B surpassing GPT-4-0314 by 8.6% on instruction tasks while maintaining strong foundational performance.

Conclusion: The dataset showcases the effectiveness of integrating foundational and chat training to develop holistic LLMs. Its release facilitates further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our
dataset\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/Infinity-Instruct} and
codes\footnote{https://gitee.com/li-touch/infinity-instruct} have been publicly
released.

*Junyong Lin,Lu Dai,Ruiqian Han,Yijie Sui,Ruilin Wang,Xingliang Sun,Qinglin Wu,Min Feng,Hao Liu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors crafted a framework, ScIRGen, for generating realistic scientific questions and answers to match researchers' information needs, resulting in a 61k QA dataset called ScIRGen-Geo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientists need nuanced and realistic datasets for research inquiries, but current tools are too simplistic for complex real-world questions.

Method: The paper introduces methods for dataset-oriented information extraction, cognitive taxonomy-based question generation, and perplexity shift-based answer filtering.

Result: They created ScIRGen-Geo, a 61k QA dataset, and evaluated current methods, discovering challenges with reasoning on complex queries.

Conclusion: This work highlights gaps in existing methods and contributes to advancing tools for better scientific retrieval and question-answering systems.

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

### [65] [Benchmarking Foundation Speech and Language Models for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11119)
*Jingyu Li,Lingchao Mao,Hairong Wang,Zhendong Wang,Xi Mao,Xuelei Sherry Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks foundation speech and language models for detecting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) using spontaneous speech, achieving the best results with acoustic features from ASR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is crucial for timely intervention, and spontaneous speech provides rich markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.

Method: The researchers used data from the PREPARE Challenge, consisting of audio recordings from 1,600+ participants categorized into healthy control, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s Disease. They benchmarked various foundation speech and language models to classify cognitive status.

Result: The Whisper-medium speech model showed the highest performance (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802), while BERT with pause annotations performed best for language (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). Including features like pause patterns improved text-based classification.

Conclusion: Acoustic-based approaches, particularly those leveraging ASR-derived embeddings, show strong promise for scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective ADRD early detection, as demonstrated by the benchmarking framework.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

### [66] [SDMPrune: Self-Distillation MLP Pruning for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11120)
*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose an improved gradient-based pruning method for large language models (LLMs) by integrating self-distillation loss during pruning to enhance generative capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment costs of large language models are prohibitively high, necessitating efficient compression techniques.

Method: The authors use self-distillation loss during pruning to fully leverage the original model's predictions. They focus on pruning the MLP modules, which are less sensitive to predictions but occupy the majority of parameters.

Result: Their pruning approach achieves significant compression of large language models without noticeable performance degradation, outperforming existing methods on zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method is effective and offers competitive performance among 1B-scale open-source LLMs, enabling cost-effective deployment while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

### [67] [SUTA-LM: Bridging Test-Time Adaptation and Language Model Rescoring for Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11121)
*Wei-Ping Huang,Guan-Ting Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in combining Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) and language model rescoring in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), proposing a method called SUTA-LM for improved performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address performance drops in ASR systems caused by real-world domain mismatches, and to improve the integration of TTA and language model rescoring methods to mitigate these issues.

Method: The proposed method, SUTA-LM, utilizes entropy-minimization-based TTA alongside an auto-step selection mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information. It combines this process with language model rescoring to refine ASR outputs.

Result: Experimental evaluation across 18 diverse ASR datasets demonstrates that SUTA-LM delivers robust and effective performance across various domains.

Conclusion: SUTA-LM successfully addresses the challenge of combining TTA and language model rescoring and proves to be a versatile solution for ASR in mismatched domains.

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

*Freddie Grabovski,Gilad Gressel,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the security risk of vishing scams via LLMs, TTS, and ASR by proposing an audio defense mechanism called ASRJam and EchoGuard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice phishing scams using advanced technologies are scalable and convincing, necessitating effective defenses.

Method: The authors propose ASRJam using adversarial perturbations and EchoGuard employing natural distortions like reverberation and echo to disrupt ASR without affecting human understanding.

Result: EchoGuard demonstrated the highest utility in disrupting ASR while maintaining a tolerable human listening experience in a 39-person user study.

Conclusion: EchoGuard and ASRJam offer proactive defense mechanisms against automated vishing scams, balancing effective ASR disruption with usability for humans.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUIRoboTron-Speech introduces a speech-based autonomous GUI agent capable of interpreting verbal instructions and screenshots to perform actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in accessibility and convenience of text-based GUI agents, particularly in hands-free scenarios.

Method: Generated training speech data using text-to-speech models, followed by progressive grounding and planning. A heuristic training strategy addressed modality imbalance in pre-trained models.

Result: The model demonstrated robust and superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Speech is a viable and effective modality for GUI agents, offering significant potential for accessibility improvements in human-computer interaction. The code and datasets are openly shared for further development.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

### [70] [Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11128)
*Andrew Keenan Richardson,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Sean Moss,Vincent Wang-Mascianica,Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: While language models improve in reasoning capabilities, their errors increasingly resemble human reasoning fallacies, suggesting a trend toward human-like biases rather than purely normative rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates if language models develop human-like reasoning patterns and associated biases as they improve in sophistication.

Method: Researchers apply the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) to create logical problems where humans predictably err, and assess 38 language models' responses across 383 tasks to identify error trends.

Result: Findings show higher model sophistication correlates with an increase in errors aligning with human reasoning fallacies ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$), independent of error rate.

Conclusion: Advancements in language model capabilities tend to mirror human reasoning biases, challenging the assumption that scaling leads to purely rational behaviors.

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show significant potential in healthcare but are hindered by hallucinations that compromise reliability and clinical utility.

Method: CHECK integrates structured clinical databases with an information-theory-based classifier to detect hallucinations and guide model refinement.

Result: CHECK reduced hallucination rates in LLama3.3-70B-Instruct model from 31% to 0.3%, achieved AUCs of 0.95-0.96 across benchmarks, and boosted GPT-4o's USMLE passing rate by 5 percentage points.

Conclusion: CHECK provides a scalable and safe foundation for deploying LLMs in medicine and other high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Method: Generate pseudo-labels via an ASR model, train a high-fidelity TTS system, and use synthetic speech-text pairs to refine the ASR system.

Result: Twister, an enhanced ASR model, achieves up to 20% lower error rates in Mandarin and 50% in Mandarin-English code-switching tests.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising alternative to self-distillation and improves ASR for low-resource or specialized applications.

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

### [73] [Scalable Medication Extraction and Discontinuation Identification from Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11137)
*Chong Shao,Douglas Snyder,Chiran Li,Bowen Gu,Kerry Ngan,Chun-Ting Yang,Jiageng Wu,Richard Wyss,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates advanced language models, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, for extracting medication information and classifying medication status from unstructured EHR notes, achieving promising performance, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting critical medication information from unstructured EHR notes for patient safety without relying on labor-intensive human annotation.

Method: The study assessed 12 large language models, both open-source and proprietary, on their ability to perform medication extraction and discontinuation classification. Testing involved three EHR datasets, various prompting strategies, and comparative evaluations using metrics such as F1 scores.

Result: GPT-4o achieved the highest F1 scores across tasks: 94.0% for medication extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint task in a zero-shot setting. Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct showed strong results in specific datasets, while medical-specific LLMs underperformed. Few-shot learning improved outcomes overall, with mixed results for reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong capability for medication information processing in EHRs, with open-source models being scalable alternatives to proprietary systems. Few-shot learning enhances model effectiveness, though reasoning boosts are inconsistent.

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

*Santiago Góngora,Ignacio Sastre,Santiago Robaina,Ignacio Remersaro,Luis Chiruzzo,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper details the RETUYT-INCO team's participation in the BEA 2025 shared task using models under 1 billion parameters, achieving competitive results despite hardware limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using small models to compete in natural language processing tasks under constraints faced by many Global South institutions, such as limited access to high-end computational resources.

Method: The authors deliberately used small-scale models (<1B parameters) to analyze their performance across five tracks in the BEA 2025 shared task, focusing on computational efficiency and accessibility.

Result: The models achieved competitive scores, with exact F1 score gaps ranging from 6.46 to 13.13 compared to the winning teams, showcasing their viability despite size limitations.

Conclusion: Small models can achieve competitive performance in challenging NLP tasks, making them a viable option for researchers with limited computational resources.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMSAE effectively identifies and mitigates biases in multilingual word embeddings using iterative SVD-based truncation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debiasing methods do not leverage the shared semantic space in multilingual representations, limiting their effectiveness and reach.

Method: The proposed IMSAE approach uses iterative SVD-based truncation to identify and mitigate bias across multiple languages in the semantic space.

Result: IMSAE demonstrates robust bias mitigation across eight languages and five demographic dimensions, including zero-shot scenarios, and performs better than traditional methods.

Conclusion: IMSAE enhances fairness in multilingual embeddings while preserving their utility, proving its superiority over monolingual and cross-lingual debiasing techniques.

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

*Kushagra Dixit,Abhishek Rajgaria,Harshavardhan Kalalbandi,Dan Roth,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in temporal table reasoning for LLMs, evaluates multiple prompting techniques, and introduces SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the unexplored impact of prompting methods on table reasoning within LLMs and the inconsistent performance of these models across different table and context structures.

Method: The authors investigated various prompting techniques across diverse table types, developed SEAR (an adaptive framework inspired by human reasoning), and explored table structure refactoring.

Result: SEAR demonstrated superior performance across all table types compared to baseline methods, and a unified representation of tables improved the model's reasoning.

Conclusion: SEAR is an effective framework for temporal table reasoning, outperforming existing techniques and benefiting from table structure refactoring.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

*Liran Ringel,Elad Tolochinsky,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new "<|continue-thinking|>" token, learned via reinforcement learning, to improve language model reasoning and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance language model performance during inference by enabling extended reasoning beyond fixed test-time scaling methods.

Method: They used a distilled DeepSeek-R1 model, froze its weights, and trained only a new learned embedding "<|continue-thinking|>" token via reinforcement learning.

Result: The learned token outperforms both the baseline and traditional fixed-token approaches, achieving notable accuracy gains, such as a 4.2% improvement on the GSM8K benchmark over the base model.

Conclusion: Learning a dedicated continue-thinking token is an effective strategy for enhancing reasoning and boosting language model accuracy during inference.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of curriculum learning on pretraining language models, identifying effective difficulty metrics and showing its benefits in improving efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curriculum learning has been successful in other areas of machine learning, prompting the investigation of its underexplored potential in pretraining language models.

Method: The authors experimented with multiple curriculum learning strategies guided by six difficulty metrics (e.g., compression ratio, readability) and evaluated performance on eight benchmarks.

Result: Curriculum learning improved convergence in early/mid-training and achieved lasting benefits as a warmup strategy, yielding up to 3.5% performance improvements.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of data ordering in pretraining and offers practical insights for data-efficient model development, identifying key difficulty signals.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Avey, a novel neural architecture that surpasses Transformer in handling long sequences effectively by decoupling sequence length from context width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of the Transformer, specifically the fixed context window and quadratic attention complexity, and explore architectures adept at handling long-range dependencies efficiently.

Method: Avey integrates a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which collaboratively identify and contextualize relevant tokens in a sequence, regardless of token positions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate Avey's competitive performance against Transformer on short-range benchmarks and superiority in capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Avey offers a promising alternative to Transformer by overcoming key inefficiencies and setting a foundation for handling arbitrarily long sequences in NLP tasks.

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

*Yi-Chien Lin,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study confirms that Transformer-based model perplexity impacts the predictive power of surprisal estimates and extends this finding from latency-based measures to brain imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the predictive power of Transformer-based model surprisal on neural measures like brain imaging data, expanding findings beyond traditional latency-based measures.

Method: The study used surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer models across three language families to evaluate predictions on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets.

Result: The study observed a consistent positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit, even for neural measures like brain imaging data.

Conclusion: Findings suggest that Transformer model perplexity influences surprisal prediction accuracy on both latency-based and neural measures, supporting generalization across different data types.

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

*Yaohui Zhang,Haijing Zhang,Wenlong Ji,Tianyu Hua,Nick Haber,Hancheng Cao,Weixin Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) for pairwise comparisons of manuscripts instead of traditional scoring, showing more accurate identification of impactful papers but raising concerns about topic novelty and institutional bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current peer review processes often replicate traditional workflows using LLMs, missing opportunities to explore transformative paradigms employing these models.

Method: The suggested approach introduces LLM agents performing pairwise comparisons of manuscripts, aggregating the results for robust evaluation of manuscript quality.

Result: Experiments reveal that the LLM-based comparative approach excels in identifying high-impact papers compared to traditional scoring systems.

Conclusion: While demonstrating enhanced accuracy, the approach introduces biases, suggesting critical areas that need addressing to ensure a fair and diverse academic review system.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

TL;DR: This study introduces text-based methods for speaker diarization using sentence-level speaker change detection, proposing two models that outperform audio-based systems in identifying speaker changes in short conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-based speaker diarization systems face challenges due to audio quality and speaker similarity. This paper aims to address these limitations using dialogue transcripts for speaker identification.

Method: The authors developed two models: Single Prediction Model (SPM) and Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), focusing on text-based methods for detecting speaker changes through sentence-level analysis.

Result: The text-based approach, especially the MPM, showed competitive performance with state-of-the-art audio-based SD systems, excelling in short dialogues and diverse conversational scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating linguistic and semantic features into speaker diarization enhances system accuracy, particularly in short conversations, opening new research opportunities in multimodal and semantic-based approaches.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ongoing issue of understanding and mitigating demographic biases in LLMs, providing tools for developers and users to assess and correct these biases.

Method: A novel approach using moral judgment-based prompts to evaluate demographic biases in LLMs toward genders, races, and age groups, and determine both the baseline biases and their strength in comparison to other demographics.

Result: Findings indicated that the baseline demographic was a white, middle-aged or young adult male, while non-baseline demographics generally exhibited a greater willingness to help, highlighting clear biases.

Conclusion: This analysis provides insight into demographic biases in LLMs, offering a methodology for more objective bias assessment and empowering users or developers to account for or address these biases.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of entity bias in relation extraction models, which leads to poor generalization.

Method: The authors adapt the Variational Information Bottleneck framework to compress entity-specific information and retain task-relevant features.

Result: The method attained state-of-the-art performance across general, financial, and biomedical relation extraction datasets in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust, interpretable, and theoretically sound solution to mitigate entity bias in relation extraction models.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across

sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and

TL;DR: The study proposes Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling (CGLS), a pretraining technique for large language models that gradually increases model layers and data complexity, showing improvement on benchmarks compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of pretraining large language models drives the need for strategies to enhance learning efficiency, inspired by cognitive development in humans.

Method: CGLS frameworks progressively increase model layers and data complexity during training, starting with simpler data and growing in complexity, with demonstrations at 100M and 1.2B parameter scales.

Result: CGLS improves performance compared to baselines on question-answering benchmarks like PIQA and ARC, with better generalization and zero-shot capability on various tasks.

Conclusion: CGLS offers an efficient strategy for pretraining large language models by leveraging progressive stacking, improving performance on reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, which affects individuals younger than the recommended age for cancer screening, and to enhance prediction methodologies.

Method: Ten different machine learning models were applied alongside advanced large language models to predict early-onset colorectal cancer using patient data, including conditions, lab results, and observations from a 6-month window prior to diagnosis.

Result: The fine-tuned large language model outperformed, achieving an average sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 91%.

Conclusion: Large language models exhibit strong potential in predicting early-onset colorectal cancer, suggesting their utility in enhancing early screening and diagnosis for younger populations.

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age
established by national guidelines for cancer screening. In this paper, we
applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey
prior to the CRC diagnoses. We retrospectively identified 1,953 CRC patients
from multiple health systems across the United States. The results demonstrated
that the fine-tuned LLM achieved an average of 73% sensitivity and 91%

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chelsea, a framework for clustering Key-Value (KV) caches in large language models, reducing memory usage and enhancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of long-context large language models (LLMs) has led to significant deployment challenges due to their substantial KV cache demands.

Method: Chelsea leverages clustering based on sequence similarity, using Chunked Soft Matching to segment sequences and merge KV caches within clusters efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Chelsea can cut KV memory usage by up to 80%, accelerate decoding by 3.19x, and lower latency by 2.72x, all while preserving model performance.

Conclusion: Chelsea offers a practical solution for optimizing KV cache usage in long-context LLMs, balancing memory efficiency and computational performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining

### [88] [Agent-RLVR: Training Software Engineering Agents via Guidance and Environment Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11425)
*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent-RLVR, a framework that enhances Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for agentic environments by providing agent guidance, improving performance significantly on software engineering benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RLVR faces challenges in agentic environments due to sparse reward landscapes, resulting in high failure rates. Hence, there is a need to make RLVR effective for multi-step, complex problem-solving domains.

Method: Agents produce initial trajectories which are validated and supplemented with agent guidance. Guidance includes strategic plans, dynamic feedback, etc., to help agents reattempt tasks successfully. The agent's policy is updated via RLVR based on guided trajectories.

Result: Agent-RLVR boosts pass@1 performance from 9.4% to 22.4% for Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct on SWE-Bench Verified, further achieving 27.8% when using guidance-augmented data for test-time reward model training.

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR introduces an effective mechanism for training agents with RLVR in complex, real-world settings, overcoming the limitations of sparse rewards and enabling higher success rates in agentic environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

*Taeeun Kim,Semin Jeong,Youngsook Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research introduces KoGEC, a fine-tuned NLLB model for Korean grammatical error correction that outperforms GPT-4 and HCX-3, and includes a Chrome extension for user accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide an efficient and specialized system for correcting grammatical errors in the Korean language, addressing gaps in performance of large language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3 in specific NLP tasks.

Method: Fine-tuning NLLB models using language-specific tokens to distinguish between original and corrected sentences, coupled with BLEU score evaluation and an "LLM as judge" methodology.

Result: Fine-tuned KoGEC models demonstrated superior outcomes in error correction tasks compared to larger language models, offering a balanced error correction profile particularly for punctuation errors.

Conclusion: KoGEC shows that compact, task-specific models can rival and sometimes outperform general-purpose large language models in specialized tasks like Korean grammatical error correction. The study emphasizes the value of specificity in NLP systems.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

### [90] [AbsenceBench: Language Models Can't Tell What's Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11440)
*Harvey Yiyun Fu,Aryan Shrivastava,Jared Moore,Peter West,Chenhao Tan,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AbsenceBench evaluates large language models' ability to detect missing information in documents across different domains, revealing significant performance limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to identify the weaknesses of LLMs in detecting missing information in documents, an area where models underperform compared to their successes in other tasks like retrieving surprising data.

Method: AbsenceBench tests LLMs by presenting both the original and edited versions of documents in three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests, asking models to find deliberately removed content.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only a 69.6% F1-score on these tasks, demonstrating poor performance despite long context handling capabilities.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models face inherent challenges in attending to gaps or omissions, highlighting a limitation where LLMs unexpectedly break down.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

*Carlos Rafael Catalan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights the shortage of human evaluators and datasets for machine translation (MT) systems in low-resource languages (LRLs) and presents a design proposal for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluators are crucial for MT systems but scarce in low-resource languages, limiting the assessment of adequacy and fluency due to insufficient datasets and expert availability.

Method: The paper reviews existing evaluation procedures and proposes a design for a platform combining recruitment and gamified evaluation to bridge the resource gap.

Result: A design for a platform aimed at recruiting human evaluators and gamifying the evaluation of MT systems for LRLs is presented alongside the challenges of its implementation and evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed platform could address resource gaps in MT systems for LRLs and may have broader applications in Natural Language Processing research.

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-PRM is introduced as a framework to enhance reasoning in clinical decision-making by verifying reasoning steps through medical knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in localizing and correcting errors in reasoning steps during clinical decision-making and improve the precision of medical diagnoses.

Method: Implementation of retrieval-augmented generation combined with process reward modeling to verify reasoning steps against clinical guidelines and literature.

Result: Med-PRM improves base models' performance by up to 13.50% and achieves over 80% accuracy on MedQA using small-scale models.

Conclusion: Med-PRM demonstrates the ability to enhance medical QA and diagnostic tasks, undergoing successful plug-and-play integration with strong policy models.

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

TL;DR: The paper examines the ability of language models (LMs) to understand medical concepts by identifying immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts. Pre-trained LMs outperform larger models on specific concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well various LMs understand medical concepts, particularly in the biomedical domain, and to assess their utility compared to expert clinicians.

Method: The authors investigated the conceptual grounding of different LMs by tasking them to identify immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts. Performance was compared to expert clinicians.

Result: Pre-trained LMs were found to have a better ability to recognize specific, low-level medical concepts compared to large LMs.

Conclusion: Pre-trained LMs demonstrate significant potential in specialized biomedical applications, especially when it comes to understanding narrowly-focused concepts like immunotherapy hallmarks.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

*Cole Gawin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if BERT encodes abstract relational concepts, finding that fine-tuning is required to induce relational structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if BERT's strong semantic task performance reflects deep conceptual understanding or surface-level statistical patterns.

Method: Internal representations of concept pairs in BERT were analyzed for taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations, with comparisons made between pretraining and fine-tuning stages.

Result: BERT shows high relational classification accuracy after fine-tuning but does not inherently organize concepts by relation type during pretraining.

Conclusion: Behavioral performance in pretrained BERT does not guarantee structured conceptual understanding, but fine-tuning fosters relational abstraction.

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

*Manlai Liang,Wanyi Huang,Mandi Liu,Huaijun Li,Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA) optimized for long-context processing in Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing computational and memory constraints with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity of attention computation and increasing memory footprint in handling long contexts, which limits the efficiency of LLMs.

Method: Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA) anchored by LagKV compression selects the top K most relevant key-value pairs in a lagging window during chunk-by-chunk prefilling to optimize long-context handling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved robustness in LLMs under key-value compression, achieving better fine-tuned performance in question-answer tasks.

Conclusion: LagKV compression and LRSA significantly enhance LLM efficiency and robustness for long-context inputs without additional parameters or excessive computation overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

*Seongbo Jang,Seonghyeon Lee,Dongha Lee,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for multimodal dialogue systems capable of responding with both text and images, optimizing performance through an end-to-end approach and parameter sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing interest in multimodal responses for dialogue systems and explore effective methods for combining modalities like text and image in retrieval-based systems.

Method: Three integration methods are proposed: two-step approaches and an end-to-end approach, with parameter sharing strategies to enhance performance and reduce computation load.

Result: Experimental results on two datasets show the end-to-end approach performs comparably to two-step approaches and benefits from parameter sharing to boost accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The end-to-end framework with parameter sharing emerges as a promising solution for multimodal dialogue systems, demonstrating effective optimization and knowledge transfer benefits.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MUDI, a method leveraging dialogue graphs, a graph encoder, and novel attention strategies to significantly enhance personalized dialogue generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the naturalness and persona-consistency of responses in personalized dialogue generation for better human-machine interaction.

Method: The authors introduce a DialogueGAT model to encode dialogue graphs structured by discourse relations and personas, followed by coherence-aware attention strategies in the generation phase.

Result: Experiments reveal significant improvements in response quality for personalized dialogues, achieving more human-like interactions.

Conclusion: Incorporating discourse relations and persona descriptions through specialized graph learning models and attention mechanisms leads to more coherent and natural personalized responses.

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) for text diacritization in Arabic and Yoruba using the new MultiDiac dataset, comparing LLMs with specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to determine if general-purpose LLMs can outperform specialized diacritization models across diverse languages and scenarios.

Method: Authors evaluated 14 LLMs and 6 specialized models using the MultiDiac dataset, added fine-tuning to small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba.

Result: LLMs outperform specialized models in diacritization for both languages, but smaller models lead to hallucinations, which fine-tuning helps mitigate.

Conclusion: Many off-the-shelf LLMs are effective for diacritization tasks, but fine-tuning small models is essential to improve performance and reduce issues like hallucinations.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces SceneGram, a dataset exploring how contextual scenes impact human conceptualizations of tangram shapes, and demonstrates that multimodal LLMs fail to match human variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how scene context shapes human conceptualization and naming of objects, and evaluate the capability of multimodal language models (LLMs) in replicating this variability.

Method: The researchers developed SceneGram, a dataset featuring human references to tangram shapes situated in different scene contexts, and compared these references to outputs from multimodal LLMs.

Result: Multimodal LLMs were found to lack the ability to capture the diversity and richness of conceptualizations evident in human object references.

Conclusion: Human conceptualization and naming are heavily influenced by scene context, a nuance that multimodal LLMs currently fail to replicate.

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-Gen is proposed to enhance edge-side small language models by generating LoRA parameters using a large cloud-side model, achieving better specialization, accuracy, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limitations of existing NLP approaches when applied to domain-specific tasks, especially for small models in edge environments.

Method: A large cloud-side model generates optimal LoRA parameters based on task descriptions, which are then merged into smaller edge-side models using reparameterization techniques to specialize them.

Result: LoRA-Gen offers significant improvements: it outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, achieves competitive accuracy with speedups (2.1x for TinyLLaMA-1.1B), and provides high compression (10.1x with Gemma-2B).

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen effectively bridges the scalability and efficiency gaps in small edge-side models, enabling domain-specific task specialization without requiring extensive training.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity of publicly annotated CRF datasets by converting existing information extraction datasets into structured CRFs for slot filling purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of publicly available, annotated CRF datasets limits the development of systems capable of automatically filling CRFs from clinical notes.

Method: A semi-automatic methodology was applied to transform the E3C dataset into high-quality CRFs in English and Italian. Results were evaluated using multiple LLM families.

Result: Closed large language models achieved slot filling performances of 59.7% (Italian) and 67.3% (English), while open-source models performed worse.

Conclusion: The study highlights both the quality of the converted dataset and the challenges for state-of-the-art LLMs in CRF slot filling tasks. The dataset is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study critiques the widely used INLP technique for introducing random modifications and proposes Mean Projection (MP) and LEACE as improved alternatives for targeted removal of linguistic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to assess the influence of specific linguistic information on model behavior through techniques that selectively remove such information.

Method: They use Amnesic Probing to evaluate how MP and LEACE perform in comparison to INLP in removing targeted linguistic information while minimizing unintended changes.

Result: MP and LEACE demonstrated a more precise removal of specific information and avoided random representation modifications seen in INLP.

Conclusion: Mean Projection and LEACE offer improved methodologies for targeted removal, aiding in better behavioral explanations through Amnesic Probing.

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex sentences while preserving semantic and logical integrity for applications such as video game design.

Method: A hybrid approach combining advanced prompting techniques with multi-agent architectures for enhanced sentence simplification using Large Language Models.

Result: Achieved a 70% success rate in simplifying complex sentences, outperforming the 48% success rate of single-agent approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent architecture is more effective than single-agent systems for sentence simplification tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into
sequences of logical, simplified sentences while preserving semantic and
logical integrity with the help of Large Language Models. We propose a hybrid
approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to
enhance the sentence simplification process. Experimental results show that our
approach was able to successfully simplify 70% of the complex sentences written
for video game design application. In comparison, a single-agent approach
attained a 48% success rate on the same task.

Motivation: Existing AI alignment models assume static and singular preferences, limiting their adaptability to diverse human feedback.

Method: CPT employs synthetically generated preference data guided by structured rubrics to fine-tune language models, allowing dynamic output adjustments without retraining.

Result: The framework achieves fine-grained control of language model outputs and enables context-dependent feedback modeling.

Conclusion: CPT represents a significant leap in aligning language model outputs with varying human preferences by leveraging structured directives and synthetic data.

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

### [105] [The Cambrian Explosion of Mixed-Precision Matrix Multiplication for Quantized Deep Learning Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11728)
*Héctor Martínez,Adrián Castelló,Francisco D. Igual,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing matrix multiplication (gemm) for mixed-precision arithmetic on modern CPU architectures, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition to reduced-precision formats in deep learning demands changes in optimizing fundamental operations like gemm to leverage more energy-efficient, high-performance hardware architectures.

Method: The paper rethinks traditional gemm design by proposing novel micro-kernel implementations and optimized data layouts tailored for mixed-precision integer arithmetic across multiple ISAs such as x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V.

Result: The study demonstrates significant performance improvements using mixed-precision integer arithmetic compared to floating-point implementations on three diverse CPU architectures.

Conclusion: Adapting gemm to mixed-precision arithmetic aligns with modern deep learning hardware demands, signifying a transformative era in matrix multiplication optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Yuliang Xu,Siming Huang,Mingmeng Geng,Yao Wan,Xuanhua Shi,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) influence programming code style, analyzing over 19,000 GitHub repositories to identify measurable trends like changes in naming conventions and code maintainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores whether and how LLMs are transforming coding styles given their increasing role in programming practices.

Method: The authors analyze code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to academic papers, focusing on aspects like naming conventions, complexity, and maintainability. They also examine algorithmic reasoning processes influenced by LLMs.

Result: Findings show measurable shifts in coding practices, such as an increase in the use of snake_case variable names in Python from 47% to 51% within two years, suggesting LLM influence.

Conclusion: This study provides the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs are impacting the real-world style of programming, though quantifying their exact influence remains challenging.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART proposes a method to reduce computational costs by replacing autoregressive reasoning in LLMs with non-autoregressive Silent Thought, achieving comparable performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address computational overhead in autoregressive Chain-of-Thought reasoning for latency-sensitive applications.

Method: DART introduces a self-distillation framework with two training pathways, leveraging Silent Thought (non-autoregressive) reasoning and a Reasoning Evolvement Module to align hidden states between pathways.

Result: DART achieves reasoning performance comparable to baseline models while significantly improving efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: DART offers a promising alternative for efficient reasoning in applications requiring reduced latency and computational overhead.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark comprising 100 PhD-level tasks to evaluate Deep Research Agents (DRAs) in web exploration, retrieval, and synthesis of information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to systematically evaluate the capabilities of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) in conducting high-level analysis and creating citation-rich reports.

Method: The authors propose two evaluation methodologies: a reference-based method with adaptive criteria for research report quality and a citation-focused framework to assess retrieval and collection capabilities.

Result: DeepResearch Bench and evaluation frameworks demonstrate alignment with human judgment, facilitating the assessment of DRAs' performance in research tasks.

Conclusion: The benchmarks and open-sourced tools aim to accelerate the development and improvement of practical, high-performing DRA systems in various fields of research.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

*Tianqi Du,Haotian Huang,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of length generalization in large language models and introduces a regularization term to improve long-context modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the limitations of fixed context windows in transformer architectures and enable generalization to longer sequences than those seen during training.

Method: Introduced the concept of long-short alignment and a metric, Long-Short Misalignment, to evaluate the consistency of output distributions across varying sequence lengths. Developed a regularization term to enhance this alignment during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves long-context modeling and establishes strong correlations between the new metric and performance.

Conclusion: The findings offer new insights into long-context modeling in LLMs and present an effective method for addressing length generalization challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

*Maximilian Kreutner,Marlene Lutz,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of persona prompts with LLMs to predict individual and group voting behaviors in European Parliament, achieving good accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if persona prompts can simulate individual and aggregated voting behaviors using LLMs, addressing biases and improving prediction reliability.

Method: The authors utilize zero-shot persona prompts, counterfactual arguments, and varied generation methods to analyze prediction accuracy and stability.

Result: The approach predicted European Parliament voting behavior with a weighted F1 score of ~0.793, demonstrating reliable simulation of voting patterns.

Conclusion: Persona prompting is a promising tool for modeling political behaviors, as it allows stable and accurate simulations of diverse and complex voting scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in abstract, visually anchored reference resolution tasks, revealing significant challenges in pragmatic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and highlight the limitations of MLLMs in performing context-dependent pragmatic reasoning using visual references.

Method: A reference resolution task involving abstract visual stimuli such as color patches and grids is used to assess MLLMs' ability to handle pragmatic language use.

Result: The study finds that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle to perform context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions, indicating a lack of basic pragmatic capabilities.

Conclusion: Despite their advancements, MLLMs demonstrate significant limitations in pragmatic reasoning, requiring further improvements for tasks involving visual and linguistic interplay.

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

### [112] [Post Persona Alignment for Multi-Session Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11857)
*Yi-Pei Chen,Noriki Nishida,Hideki Nakayama,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a framework that improves long-term consistency and personalization in multi-session dialogues by refining responses after initial generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in maintaining persona fidelity, conversational coherence, and diversity in multi-session personalized dialogue generation using LLMs.

Method: Proposes a two-stage Post Persona Alignment (PPA) framework: (1) Generate a general response based on dialogue context; (2) Retrieve persona information using the response as a query; (3) Refine the response to align with the user's persona.

Result: Experiments show PPA substantially enhances consistency, diversity, and persona relevance compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: PPA provides a more effective and flexible approach for personalized long-term dialogue generation, overcoming limitations of existing persona retrieval methods.

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

*Xiaoran Liu,Siyang He,Qiqi Wang,Ruixiao Li,Yuerong Song,Zhigeng Liu,Linlin Li,Qun Liu,Zengfeng Huang,Qipeng Guo,Ziwei He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework named FourierAttention to address memory challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs) by compressing key-value caches using Fourier bases, reducing long-context inefficiencies. It achieves superior long-context accuracy and efficient memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory demands and inefficiencies in LLMs caused by the expanding key-value cache as context lengths increase, and to improve accuracy while avoiding excessive computational overhead.

Method: FourierAttention is a training-free method that identifies distinct roles of transformer head dimensions, using Fourier bases to project and compress long-context-insensitive dimensions. A custom kernel named FlashFourierAttention is also designed to optimize memory usage.

Result: FourierAttention demonstrates superior long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) benchmarks, while improving memory efficiency through a streamlined custom implementation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully optimizes LLM memory usage without sacrificing performance, offering a novel approach for handling long contexts in transformer models.

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a

variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base

Motivation: Assessing the effectiveness of counter-speech is challenging and lacks defined criteria. This paper aims to address this gap by creating a framework to evaluate CS grounded in social science.

Method: The study identifies six core dimensions (Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience Adaptation, Fairness) to annotate 4,214 CS examples. It also applies multi-task and dependency-based classification strategies.

Result: Strong classification performance (average F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.96) was achieved using both expert- and user-written counter-speech, surpassing standard baselines.

Conclusion: The paper provides an effective framework to evaluate CS, strong classification models, and highlights interdependence among the dimensions, contributing significantly to CS research.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task

*Dongwei Jiang,Alvin Zhang,Andrew Wang,Nicholas Andrews,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how effectively LLMs incorporate external feedback under controlled experimental conditions and finds that even with near-perfect feedback, models struggle to fully integrate it, a limitation termed 'Feedback Friction.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observation that while LLMs can improve responses with feedback, their thoroughness and efficiency in leveraging such feedback remain unclear.

Method: The authors design a controlled experimental pipeline where a solver model provides solutions, receives feedback from a feedback generator equipped with ground-truth answers, and attempts solutions again. They test this across diverse tasks using state-of-the-art LLMs like Claude 3.7.

Result: Even with ideal feedback conditions, LLMs demonstrate significant resistance to fully integrating feedback, termed 'Feedback Friction,' and proposed sampling-based strategies show limited success in overcoming this limitation.

Conclusion: Highlighting 'Feedback Friction' and ruling out common assumptions about its causes, this study aims to guide future research on improving LLMs' capacity for self-improvement.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks due to their ability to generate diverse responses to uncontrolled inputs.

Method: They propose finetuning models using a triplet-based loss function and adversarial hard negative mining for improved separation between benign and harmful representations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms prior defenses in handling input-level and embedding-space attacks without negatively impacting standard model performance.

Conclusion: Contrastive representation learning emerges as a promising approach to bolster the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks, showing advancements over existing defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: To solve the problem of poor object detection performance in low-resolution images by combining image enhancement and advanced detection methods.

Method: ESRGAN enhances image quality as a pre-processing step, followed by using Faster R-CNN for object detection.

Result: The integrated approach outperforms traditional methods, ensuring better object detection on low-resolution images.

Conclusion: This framework is effective and reliable for variable or poor-quality image scenarios, achieving a balance between enhancement and detection efficiency.

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves

TL;DR: This paper improves a Large Language Model-based framework, RefAV, for mining scenarios in autonomous vehicle datasets by addressing runtime errors and inaccuracies in spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the scenario mining process in autonomous driving datasets by overcoming the limitations of the existing RefAV framework, specifically runtime errors and interpretation challenges with spatial relationships.

Method: The proposed approach introduces (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism to refine LLM-generated code and (2) specialized prompt engineering to better understand and apply spatial-relationship functions.

Result: Experimental results on Argoverse 2 using LLMs show consistent improvement across metrics, with a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 achieved using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques demonstrate strong potential for improving the reliability and precision of scenario mining in autonomous driving datasets.

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

### [121] [Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126)
*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops an advanced image-based method using the StarDist algorithm for classifying iron ore pellets and identifying quality issues, significantly improving measurement accuracy and size distribution analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to accurately identify and analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments, crucial for determining the quality of iron ore pellets.

Method: The authors employ the StarDist algorithm, originally used in the medical field, for segmenting, contouring, classifying, and measuring the dimensions of iron ore pellets.

Result: The novel method enhances the accuracy of physical dimension measurements and size distribution analysis, outperforming traditional algorithms like Mask R-CNN and Vision Transformer in this specific application.

Conclusion: Leveraging the StarDist algorithm, the research provides a robust solution to challenges in pellet classification, paving the way for improved quality assessment and addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Segment This Thing (STT), an efficient segmentation model using image foveation and variable-resolution tokenization based on distance from a single point prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve image segmentation efficiency without reducing model size, focusing on reducing computational cost and enhancing performance for applications like augmented reality and robotics.

Method: STT utilizes a novel foveation approach to crop the input image around a point prompt, coupled with variable-resolution patch tokenization. Patches farther from the prompt are downsampled more heavily to minimize token count and computational load.

Result: The model achieves efficiency gains while maintaining competitive performance in segmentation benchmarks. It operates interactively on consumer hardware, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Segment This Thing combines efficiency with robust performance, leveraging foveation and tokenization innovations, thereby serving as a practical solution for interactive and resource-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

*Dylan Green,Yuting Shang,Jiaee Cheong,Yang Liu,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates gender fairness in machine learning and deep learning methods for automated pain detection, finding biases in all models, though Vision Transformer was the most accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-researched issue of accuracy and gender fairness in ML and DL pain detection models, especially given the significant potential for these technologies in healthcare.

Method: Compared traditional ML (Linear SVM, RBF SVM) with DL methods (CNN, ViT) on the UNBC-McMaster dataset using visual modality, assessing accuracy and fairness metrics.

Result: Vision Transformer (ViT) performed best in terms of accuracy and some fairness metrics, but all models displayed gender-based biases.

Conclusion: Despite achieving high accuracy, current models have inherent gender biases, underscoring the necessity for fairness-aware adjustments in machine learning for healthcare systems.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses 3D hand articulation estimation from a single RGB image, proposing a pipeline without requiring camera parameters, achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like absence of depth, occlusions, articulation complexity, and camera parameter requirement in estimating 3D hand articulation from a single RGB image.

Method: Introduced an optimization pipeline that uses 2D keypoint input with keypoint alignment and fingertip loss, eliminating the need for camera parameters.

Result: The approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks and proves robust in 'in-the-wild' scenarios without camera parameter knowledge.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective and competitive for 3D hand estimation, showcasing robustness without camera dependency, despite 2D keypoint's sensitivity.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new loss function, ContextLoss (CLoss), for image segmentation that improves topology preservation by addressing topological errors with extended context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving topology in image segmentation is critical for various applications like vessel and road mapping. Existing methods struggle with topological errors, which can heavily affect practical tasks like navigation.

Method: The authors propose ContextLoss (CLoss), a loss function that uses a broader critical pixel mask to improve focus on topological errors. They also devise two new metrics to evaluate connectivity improvements due to reduced missed connections.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets and a new nano-imaging dataset of bone cement lines demonstrate that CLoss improves topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed connections than state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: ContextLoss (CLoss) enhances topology preservation in image segmentation and outperforms current methods, offering a valuable tool for applications demanding high topological accuracy. The code is made publicly available.

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

*Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Jing Ren,Ciyuan Peng,Chengyao Xie,Bowen Li,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMAP introduces a multimodal graph learning framework to identify brain regions impacted by neurodegenerative diseases with high computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting neurodegenerative diseases using graph learning techniques while addressing localization of specific brain regions and computational complexity.

Method: BrainMAP filters critical brain subgraphs using the AAL atlas, reduces computational overhead by focusing on disease-relevant subgraphs, and employs cross-node attention and adaptive gating for multimodal fusion of fMRI and DTI data.

Result: BrainMAP achieves over 50% reduction in computational overhead and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework balances computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, making it a practical approach for identifying disease-relevant brain regions.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

*Paul Couairon,Loick Chambon,Louis Serrano,Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard,Matthieu Cord,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR is an advanced feature upsampler improving visual feature resolution for dense vision tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance spatial resolution of visual features produced by Foundation Vision Encoders to better support downstream tasks.

Method: Introduced JAFAR, uses an attention-based module with Spatial Feature Transform modulation for semantic alignment during upsampling.

Result: JAFAR generalizes well to high output scales even without high-resolution supervision, recovering fine-grained details and outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: JAFAR significantly enhances feature upsampling quality, proving effective for various dense vision tasks.

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper showcases the creation of an autonomous computer vision system using Agentic AI methods, enabling task interpretation, planning, and execution based on natural language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how agentic AI systems, specifically those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), can autonomously perform roles traditionally requiring human expertise in complex tasks like computer vision.

Method: The authors extended SimpleMind's framework by integrating an LLM-based agent to automate task planning, tool configuration, and execution for medical image analysis tasks. The system interprets natural language prompts and develops workflows.

Result: The autonomous system successfully segmented lungs, heart, and ribs in chest x-rays with high accuracy (mean dice scores: lungs – 0.96, heart – 0.82, ribs – 0.83) using 50 images, showcasing its capability to plan, train, and test itself.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Agentic AI methods can autonomously perform computer vision task planning and execution, potentially replacing the need for human data scientists in such areas.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method is proposed for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) that addresses challenges like pseudo-label inefficiency, class imbalance, and prediction uncertainty using four novel strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in existing SSSS methods, such as poor utilization of pseudo-labels, class imbalance issues, and neglect of uncertain predictions.

Method: Four main techniques are introduced: fuzzy pseudo-labeling, uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, adaptive class rebalancing, and lightweight contrastive regularization.

Result: The proposed framework provides significant improvements in segmenting under-represented classes and ambiguous regions, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The holistic framework effectively leverages uncertainty, leading to better semantic segmentation performance especially in difficult and imbalanced scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman enhances human video generation by tackling motion naturalness and visual fidelity challenges, achieving faster inference with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to tackle the challenge of balancing motion naturalness and visual fidelity in human video generation using diffusion models.

Method: AlignHuman employs a divide-and-conquer strategy using Preference Optimization and timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO). It introduces LoRA modules trained on preference data to focus on specific timestep intervals for improvement.

Result: AlignHuman enhances motion dynamics and fidelity significantly while reducing the number of inference steps (NFEs) from 100 to 30, achieving a 3.3× speedup without compromising the generation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method, AlignHuman, successfully advances human animation by optimizing competing objectives, speeding up inference, and maintaining the quality of video generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI has excelled in digital content creation, but its application to Physical AI for creating functionally viable designs has been underexplored. Existing models often ignore real-world physical constraints.

Method: The authors developed LLM-to-Phy3D, an online refinement framework using a black-box loop where LLM outputs are iteratively evaluated and improved via visual and physics-based feedback.

Result: Using systematic evaluations, including vehicle design optimization tasks, the paper demonstrates improvements of 4.5% to 106.7% in physical conformity with the reference design compared to conventional models.

Conclusion: The promising results show LLM-to-Phy3D is a valuable tool for advancing generative design in Physical AI, fostering its application in engineering and scientific domains.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

*Jonathan Grizou,Carlos de la Torre-Ortiz,Tuukka Ruotsalo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CURSOR, a novel algorithm that recovers mental targets (e.g., perceived images) from EEG data in a self-calibrating manner without requiring labeled data or pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to recover mental targets from EEG data rely on labeled information. However, obtaining labeled data is often impractical or costly. This paper addresses the challenge of recovering mental imagery without relying on labeled data or pre-trained decoders.

Method: CURSOR is a framework and algorithm that leverages self-calibration. It learns image similarities and ranks stimuli against unknown mental targets by correlating EEG patterns, and also generates images resembling the mental target.

Result: CURSOR successfully predicts human-like perceptual similarity scores, ranks visual stimuli matching unseen mental targets, and generates images close to the unknown mental targets, as validated by a user study.

Conclusion: The proposed CURSOR framework showcases the feasibility of recovering mental targets without labeled data, advancing methods in brain-computer interfaces and cognitive neuroscience research.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoCaption, an automated framework leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating diverse and detailed video captions. A new benchmark, MCTS-VCB, was also proposed for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning benchmarks and evaluation protocols are inadequate due to issues like poor creation of key points, high costs, and limited evaluation scope, necessitating a more comprehensive approach.

Method: The proposed AutoCaption framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively generate diverse and detailed video captions. This is further used to compile MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video captioning benchmark.

Result: Tests on more than 20 MLLMs showed MCTS-VCB's effectiveness in evaluating video captioning capabilities, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving an F1 score of 71.2. Fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B using AutoCaption data improved its performance significantly on MCTS-VCB and DREAM-1K benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoCaption is an effective tool for enhancing video caption benchmarks, improving evaluation comprehensiveness, and boosting MLLMs' performance. The proposed MCTS-VCB benchmark sets a new standard in fine-grained video captioning assessments.

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform social reasoning by addressing their limitations in inferring non-verbal social cues through a new task and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social behavior requires analyzing emotions and social dynamics, which involve non-verbal cues. Current models like LLMs are limited to textual information, and the capacity of VLMs for such reasoning hasn't been well-studied.

Method: The authors identify the 'Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference' gap in VLMs, propose a new task to address this gap, and create a high-quality dataset to evaluate the performance of VLMs in social reasoning.

Result: The researchers benchmarked several VLMs using their new dataset, uncovering insights into their capabilities and identifying limitations in addressing non-verbal social reasoning.

Conclusion: The study underscores a significant gap in VLMs' ability to interpret non-verbal social cues and presents a novel task and dataset to further research in equipping these models for better social reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes utilizing deep learning and synthetic data generation to visualize Earth's subsurface in 3D using surface data and borehole information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of reliably visualizing Earth's subsurface is pivotal for applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical engineering.

Method: A neural network is trained using synthetic geological data that mimics natural geological processes to generate 3D subsurface images from surface geological features.

Result: The model effectively produces subsurface structures, including layers, faults, folds, and intrusions, with improved accuracy as more borehole data is integrated.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates promising advancements for subsurface imaging that could aid traditional inverse modeling techniques, opening new doors for geological and engineering applications.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the performance and suitability of different deep learning models (BiLSTM and CNN+GRU) for Human Activity Recognition using WiFi-based data.

Method: The study tested BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models on UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR datasets, analyzing their ability to capture spatial and temporal features.

Result: CNN+GRU achieved 95.20% accuracy on UT-HAR, while BiLSTM reached 92.05% accuracy on NTU-Fi HAR, demonstrating dataset-specific strengths.

Conclusion: Dataset characteristics significantly influence model choice and performance, and such models can be used in real-world healthcare and smart home systems.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a zero-shot framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for reasoning-based medical image diagnosis, especially in scenarios with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in clinical decision-making for medical image diagnosis, particularly reasoning-based tasks, and overcome the limitations of low data availability and high annotation costs for supervised fine-tuning.

Method: The authors propose a test-time scaling strategy where a vision-language model processes medical images and textual prompts to generate interpretations, which are then consolidated into diagnoses by an LLM.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy across various medical imaging domains such as radiology, ophthalmology, and histopathology, with enhanced reliability and classification performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows significant potential to enhance reasoning accuracy and diagnostic reliability in medical imaging tasks without requiring extensive labeled data.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI analysis methods struggle with reproducibility and transferability issues due to task-specific models and preprocessing complexity.

Method: NeuroSTORM uses a pre-trained Mamba backbone with spatial-temporal optimization for direct learning from 4D fMRI volumes, along with task-specific prompt tuning for transferability.

Result: The framework outperformed existing methods in various tasks such as predictions, retrieval, and classification across diverse clinical datasets.

Conclusion: NeuroSTORM establishes a robust, generalized foundation model for fMRI analysis, enhancing clinical utility and improving research reproducibility.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

*Yinlong Liu,Tianyu Huang,Zhi-Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel way to reshape rotation estimation problems into linear model fitting problems without losing constraints or introducing complexities, achieving remarkable robustness against noise and outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in non-linear and non-convex rotation estimation problems which are crucial in safety-critical computer vision and robotics tasks.

Method: It reformulates rotation estimation into a linear approach, leveraging a dual motion representation as a great circle on a quaternion sphere. A voting-based estimation method is employed, which utilizes GPU computation for high efficiency.

Result: The method achieved high robustness to noise and outliers, resolving large-scale problems with up to 99% outlier ratios under 0.5 seconds using GPU parallelization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an effective and robust solution for rotation estimation, proving superior both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaveFormer, a compact transformer architecture designed for gesture recognition using sEMG signals, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in classifying similar gestures with nearly identical muscle signals while addressing computational constraints of traditional deep learning models for embedded systems.

Method: The authors developed WaveFormer using a learnable wavelet transform integrating time and frequency features, and implemented WaveletConv, a depthwise separable convolution module for efficiency.

Result: WaveFormer achieved 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset with only 3.1M parameters and demonstrated real-time inference latency of 6.75 ms on INT8-quantized hardware.

Conclusion: WaveFormer offers a lightweight, high-performance solution for sEMG-based gesture recognition, making it viable for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

*Hongyu Chen,Jiping Liu,Yong Wang,Jun Zhu,Dejun Feng,Yakun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SF-TMAT, a benchmark framework for UAV object detection in adverse scenes, featuring dynamic mask adjustment and pseudo-label smoothing strategies to enhance domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges associated with UAV object detection in adverse conditions where domain gaps, feature misalignment, and noisy pseudo-labels hinder performance.

Method: Propose Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT), incorporating DSFMA for dynamic mask adjustments and VFST for smoothing threshold refinement.

Result: Experiments show SF-TMAT significantly improves performance and generalization capabilities of UAV object detection in challenging adverse scenarios.

Conclusion: SF-TMAT successfully mitigates domain bias and improves feature alignment and pseudo-label quality, enhancing UAV object detection in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved YOLOv11 model for accurate vehicle speed detection and classification using drone footage, achieving high performance with a mean absolute error of 0.97 mph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for vehicle speed detection in California lack accuracy, fail to identify lanes, and have limited classification categories. The paper aims to address these limitations for better traffic monitoring and enforcement.

Method: A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model is trained on 800 bird's-eye view images. The model detects vehicle lanes, classifies vehicles (cars and heavy vehicles), and analyzes the effects of drone height, ROI distance, and vehicle speed on detection accuracy.

Result: The proposed system achieves high accuracy in speed detection and classification, with MAE of 0.97 mph and MSE of 0.94 mph², surpassing existing YOLO-based methods.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned YOLOv11 is effective for vehicle speed detection and classification in challenging scenarios, offering practical applications for traffic monitoring and regulation.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

*Yuwen Tan,Boqing Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new paradigm of 'knowledge-tracing' machine unlearning for foundation models, bypassing the limitations of traditional data-tracing unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focusing on data-tracing unlearning are unsuitable for foundation models due to lack of access to massive training data by various stakeholders and the diverse unlearning demands from regulators, enterprises, and product teams.

Method: The researchers propose transitioning from data-tracing to knowledge-tracing unlearning, aligning more closely with cognitive processes and enabling the removal of unwanted knowledge or capabilities without relying on exact training data.

Result: A case study on a vision-language foundation model demonstrates how this knowledge-tracing unlearning framework can be practically implemented.

Conclusion: Knowledge-tracing unlearning is both practical and cognitively aligned, offering a scalable approach to meet diverse unlearning requirements for foundation models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Result: Demonstrated strong performance in tasks like controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous control, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: STRIDE combined with TARDIS suggests advancements in generalist agents capable of spatial-temporal reasoning and manipulating their environments.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for evaluating Geo-FMs are limited to specific tasks and geographic areas. The authors aim to provide a more diverse dataset for pixel-wise regression tasks to measure the performance of Geo-FMs globally.

Method: The study creates a benchmark dataset combining hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the EnMAP satellite and AGB density estimates derived from GEDI lidars, covering seven continental regions. It evaluates Geo-FMs against a U-Net baseline for pixel-wise regression tasks.

Result: Geo-FMs achieved comparable or superior performance to the U-Net baseline, particularly when fine-tuning the encoder. The dataset size and Vision Transformer token patch size were critical factors for performance accuracy.

Conclusion: The globally distributed dataset facilitates the development and evaluation of Geo-FMs in hyperspectral applications, addressing geographic biases and generalization challenges. The dataset and source code will be publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Result: The study showcased the versatility and quality of the GynSurg dataset, enabling comprehensive surgical workflow analysis and discovery of novel procedural insights.

Conclusion: Public release of the GynSurg dataset is expected to accelerate advancements in surgical video analysis and intelligent systems for gynecologic laparoscopy.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

### [151] [A Watermark for Auto-Regressive Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11371)
*Yihan Wu,Xuehao Cui,Ruibo Chen,Georgios Milis,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-reweight, a watermarking method for image generation models addressing retokenization mismatch, ensuring authenticity without compromising image quality or detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic image generation models poses risks such as misuse for deepfakes and misleading visual evidence, highlighting the need for effective authenticity verification mechanisms.

Method: The proposed method, C-reweight, uses a clustering-based strategy to treat tokens equivalently within clusters, overcoming retokenization mismatch and maintaining distortion-free watermarking.

Result: Extensive testing showed that C-reweight preserves image fidelity while enhancing watermark detectability compared to existing techniques across top image generation platforms.

Conclusion: C-reweight offers a breakthrough solution for secure and trustworthy image synthesis, ensuring high-quality visuals and robust authenticity verification.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Nikos Deligiannis,Aleksandra Pižurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable, one-stage clustering framework for hyperspectral images (HSIs) that integrates local and non-local constraints to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperspectral image clustering methods are computationally intensive, rely on a two-stage framework, and fail to jointly optimize spatial and spectral structural constraints.

Method: The proposed method uses basis representation with spatial smoothness and mini-cluster-based schemes to jointly preserve local and non-local structures during clustering.

Result: The developed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world hyperspectral datasets while reducing computational complexity to O(n), making it scalable for large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing spatial and spectral constraints in a one-stage deep clustering framework significantly enhances performance and scalability for hyperspectral image analysis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoxin Lu,Ranran Haoran Zhang,Yusen Zhang,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating coherent text-image task plans, addressing alignment and coherence challenges between text and visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore omitted research gaps on the capacity of large-scale models to generate coherent text-image task plans, a topic that remains under-discussed compared to textual-only plan generation.

Method: The proposed method involves a four-stage iterative framework to generate and refine text-image plans. It drafts textual or visual steps, extracts PDDL-like information, and refines these steps iteratively while utilizing a plug-and-play approach with established models like Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o.

Result: A benchmark dataset of 1,100 task pairs across 11 daily topics was used to assess method effectiveness. Newly proposed metrics validated the multimodal plan’s consistency and coherence.Clearly surpassing competitive baselines through extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: The iterative framework is effective for creating coherent text-image plans, offering significant improvement when applied to existing large-scale models. The proposed metrics and benchmarks facilitate future research in this area.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a new approach to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) models by focusing on spatial reasoning using a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQA models struggle with complex reasoning and understanding spatial relationships in images.

Method: The research proposes a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower structured in four layers based on human gestalt vision principles, replacing traditional attention mechanisms.

Result: The introduced module can integrate with existing multimodal models to enhance their reasoning abilities and achieve state-of-the-art performance on spatial relation question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: This dynamic spatial reasoning module significantly improves image perception and spatial relationship understanding, demonstrating potential advancements in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

*Dokyoon Yoon,Youngsook Song,Woomyong Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a preference learning approach, called \mymethod, to reduce hallucination issues in multimodal large language models during vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs undermine reliability in tasks requiring accurate object identification.

Method: The authors construct a dataset with hallucinated and correct responses, and target relevant object information. Then, they apply preference learning focused on these areas to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Experimental results show \mymethod successfully decreases hallucinations and improves MLLM reliability without affecting overall performance.

Conclusion: \mymethod strengthens the generation of factual responses by targeting hallucination-prone areas, making MLLMs more dependable in vision-language scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Auto-Connect introduces a method for automatic rigging, ensuring better topological and skinning accuracy by using connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-based optimization, and geodesic-aware processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches struggle with skeletal connectivity and topology accuracy in automatic rigging.

Method: Auto-Connect uses special connectivity-preserving tokens, topology-aware reward functions, and geodesic features for bone selection.

Result: The framework achieves anatomically plausible skeletal structures with improved deformation and skinning quality.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect significantly enhances skeletal rigging by directly integrating topological and geodesic considerations, addressing common artifacts.

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

*Jie Zhu,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a black-box auditing framework, FSCA, for text-to-image diffusion models to address data provenance challenges, achieving superior performance without requiring access to internal model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle issues related to copyright compliance and personal privacy leakage caused by the reliance of text-to-image diffusion models on large-scale web-sourced datasets, while addressing shortcomings in existing data auditing methods.

Method: The researchers introduce the Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA) framework, which leverages semantic connections within the model to audit data provenance without requiring internal model access. They also propose a recall balance and threshold adjustment strategy to enhance performance.

Result: FSCA demonstrates robust performance by outperforming eight state-of-the-art methods on LAION-mi and COCO datasets, achieving a user-level accuracy of 90% with just 10 samples per user in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: FSCA is a practical and effective solution for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion models, offering strong real-world application potential while maintaining user privacy and avoiding dependency on internal model details.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes TAViS, a novel framework that integrates multimodal foundation models for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) while addressing cross-modal alignment challenges using a text-bridged design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of aligning audio and visual modalities in AVS tasks, recognizing the limitations of existing methods that rely on single-modality knowledge or off-the-shelf combination of foundation models.

Method: The proposed method, TAViS, integrates multimodal foundation models (ImageBind) and segmentation models (SAM2) using a text-bridged design featuring a hybrid prompting mechanism and alignment supervision strategy. Text is used to bridge feature spaces and refine alignment across modalities.

Result: TAViS demonstrates superior performance on single-source, multi-source, and semantic datasets as well as in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses cross-modal alignment in AVS by coupling multimodal and segmentation models with a text-bridged design, setting a new benchmark for performance in this domain.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to incorporate uncertainty awareness into a contrastive learning model for cancer subtyping, improving classification accuracy and reducing labeling requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training cancer subtyping models with limited expert-labeled data, especially when certainty in predictions is critical.

Method: The authors proposed a self-supervised contrastive learning model that incorporates uncertainty awareness by calculating an evidence vector. This score identifies important images requiring annotations and refines training iteratively.

Result: Using only 1-10% of selected annotations, the model achieved state-of-the-art performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach reduces the reliance on extensive labeled datasets and enhances classification performance, proving valuable for digital pathology where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

TL;DR: V2LMs (Vehicle Vision Language Models) provide robustness in autonomous vehicle perception tasks, outperforming traditional DNNs, especially under adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring improved security and resilience in autonomous vehicle perception systems, as traditional DNN-based methods are vulnerable and degrade in performance under adversarial attacks.

Method: Introduce and evaluate Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), using Solo and Tandem Modes with fine-tuned vision-language models for AV tasks. Performance is compared against conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions.

Result: V2LMs maintained adversarial accuracy with less than 8% drops compared to DNNs, which experienced performance declines of 33%-46% under attacks. Tandem Mode achieved memory efficiency while providing robustness.

Conclusion: V2LMs are a promising approach for secure and resilient autonomous vehicle perception, handling adversarial conditions more robustly than traditional DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on model attribution in Deepfake forensics, which is crucial for identifying the origins of manipulated media.

Method: The proposed framework, FAME, uses spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to detect generative artifacts unique to different face-swap models, providing a lightweight and efficient solution.

Result: FAME consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and runtime across three datasets: DFDM, FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb.

Conclusion: FAME proves to be a powerful tool for model attribution in Deepfake forensics, with potential applications in digital security and media integrity.

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

### [162] [Environmental Change Detection: Toward a Practical Task of Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11481)
*Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Hongje Seong,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research introduces Environmental Change Detection (ECD) to overcome the limitations of traditional Scene Change Detection (SCD) methods, which assume perfectly aligned query and reference images. Through a novel framework, the study leverages uncurated, large-scale databases and semantic representation aggregation for detecting environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Scene Change Detection (SCD) methods rely on perfectly aligned query and reference image viewpoints, which is an unrealistic assumption when applied to real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a framework using uncurated large-scale image databases, multiple reference candidates, and semantic representation aggregation to detect environmental changes despite query-reference viewpoint misalignments.

Result: The framework outperforms naive combinations of existing state-of-the-art methods on Environmental Change Detection benchmarks and achieves comparable performance to an ideal (oracle) setting.

Conclusion: Environmental Change Detection (ECD) is a more practical approach compared to traditional Scene Change Detection, as it effectively addresses viewpoint misalignment and limited field-of-view issues, using multiple references and semantic data aggregation.

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The
implementation is available at

### [164] [Preserving Clusters in Prompt Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11493)
*Tung-Long Vuong,Hoang Phan,Vy Vo,Anh Bui,Thanh-Toan Do,Trung Le,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to improve Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) using CLIP's multi-modal pre-trained models by leveraging geometry of visual and text embeddings and optimal transport theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP show state-of-the-art performance in UDA due to their semantic knowledge, limitations exist in the misalignment of visual embeddings across domains that can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels.

Method: The authors address these limitations by utilizing the geometric relationship between source and target visual embeddings and enforcing clustering properties in text embeddings based on optimal transport theory to improve alignment in the target domain.

Result: Experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance and improves the quality of target prompts' representation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study showcases a novel way to boost the effectiveness of pre-trained multi-modal models for UDA by leveraging unexplored embedding properties, leading to better domain alignment and improved outcomes.

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

*Xiao Xu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Manager, a plugin for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that enhances cross-modal understanding by aggregating insights from varied unimodal layers, achieving better performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing VLMs, such as poor utilization of unimodal representations, limited semantic flexibility, and restrictions to low-resolution datasets, while aiming to achieve deeper VL alignment and fusion.

Method: The proposed Manager plugin integrates insights from unimodal experts into cross-modal layers. It is applied to Two-Tower VLM architecture (ManagerTower) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs like LLaVA-OV) and evaluated with a multi-grid algorithm.

Result: ManagerTower outperforms baseline models in 4 VL tasks. LLaVA-OV-Manager enhances zero-shot performance across diverse datasets and resolutions. The synergy between Manager and the multi-grid algorithm boosts visual representation and overall performance.

Conclusion: Manager plugin improves VLM efficiency by leveraging diverse levels of representation. It achieves state-of-the-art results across various architectures and datasets, showing compatibility with different algorithms and mitigating semantic ambiguity.

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

*Samuel Cerezo,Javier Civera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that improves accuracy by delaying global GNSS data use and relying first on relative GNSS information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address poor initial estimates in sensorized platforms caused by limited initial measurements, which often result in local minima during non-linear optimization.

Method: The proposed method delays the use of global GNSS data until sufficient information is available and uses GNSS relative distance residuals initially. A criterion based on Hessian matrix singular values determines when to switch to global measurements.

Result: Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets indicate that the approach outperforms naive strategies by providing more accurate and robust initializations.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy improves initialization accuracy for GNSS-inertial platforms by smartly leveraging relative GNSS data and a switching criterion, avoiding premature reliance on global measurements.

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIMA-Q, a novel post-training quantization method for Vision Transformers (ViTs), significantly improving accuracy for low-bit scenarios by effectively approximating quantization loss via a diagonal plus low-rank Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the accuracy degradation faced by current post-training quantization methods for Vision Transformers, particularly under low-bit quantization settings.

Method: The method establishes a connection between KL divergence and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to compute quantization loss efficiently. It introduces the DPLR-FIM method, a diagonal plus low-rank approximation, to further enhance computational efficiency during block-wise reconstruction.

Result: The proposed FIMA-Q method achieves substantial improvements in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art post-training quantization techniques, especially in low-bit quantization scenarios, validated across various vision tasks and ViT architectures.

Conclusion: FIMA-Q provides a cost-effective and accurate solution for post-training quantization in ViTs, addressing the limitations of conventional Hessian-based methods, and demonstrates strong empirical results on public datasets.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

*Zhaoyang Wang,Wen Lu,Jie Li,Lihuo He,Maoguo Gong,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EyeSimVQA, a novel video quality assessment framework leveraging free-energy-based self-repair mechanisms and biologically inspired designs to improve evaluation accuracy, particularly against state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unique challenges of video quality assessment (VQA), including temporal dynamics and the limitations imposed by pre-trained backbones, as well as the need for integrating free-energy-based self-repair mechanisms seen in image quality assessment (IQA).

Method: The proposed method, EyeSimVQA, employs a dual-branch architecture to separately handle global perceptual evaluation and fine-grained structural analysis. It integrates adaptive repair modules into these branches, utilizes a strategy for incorporating high-level features without disrupting pre-trained backbones, and includes a gaze-inspired prediction head to combine local and global features.

Result: EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior performance on five public VQA benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also offers enhanced interpretability due to its biologically inspired design.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in VQA by utilizing innovative architecture and enhancement strategies, demonstrating both high accuracy in benchmarks and improved model interpretability.

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

*Bo-Cheng Chiu,Jen-Jee Chen,Yu-Chee Tseng,Feng-Chi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DaMO, a Video Large Language Model designed for better temporal reasoning in video-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs lack precise temporal reasoning and struggle with aligning responses to specific video moments.

Method: DaMO uses a Temporal-aware Fuseformer with a hierarchical dual-stream architecture for temporal dynamics and multimodal fusion, alongside a four-stage training paradigm to ensure multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning.

Result: DaMO outperforms existing methods in tasks demanding temporal alignment and reasoning on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: DaMO addresses fine-grained temporal reasoning challenges in Video LLMs effectively and sets a new standard for data-efficient video-language modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

*Jiachen Yu,Yufei Zhan,Ziheng Wu,Yousong Zhu,Jinqiao Wang,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores why long chains of thought (CoT) enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in solving complex problems. It develops an automatic editing pipeline and introduces VFaith-Bench to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand why introducing long chains of thought improves the reasoning abilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), with a particular focus on whether their reasoning process faithfully relies on visual information.

Method: The authors present an automatic, controllable visual cue editing pipeline using GPT-Image-1 to alter images systematically. They also introduce VFaith-Bench, a benchmark consisting of 755 entries across five subsets, to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning accuracy and identify the role of visual perception in reasoning.

Result: The experimentation on flagship and open-source models using VFaith-Bench yielded insights into their visual reasoning and faithfulness to visual cues. Specific accuracy metrics quantified the impact of visual cue alterations on reasoning performance.

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench is effective for analyzing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, emphasizing the connection between visual perception and reasoning performance. The findings offer new understanding to refine the reasoning processes in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current vehicle classification systems, like WIM, in accurately detecting lifted truck axles.

Method: A convolutional neural network (YOLOv8s) was implemented to detect lifted truck axles in images captured from side-facing cameras.

Result: The method achieves 87% precision, 91.7% recall, and a fast inference time of 1.4 ms, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for real-time detection of lifted axles, and its performance could be enhanced with larger datasets and image augmentation techniques.

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes A$^2$LC, an efficient framework for semantic segmentation label correction that automates corrections and enhances cost-efficiency, outperforming existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-wise annotation for semantic segmentation is expensive and error-prone. Active Label Correction could alleviate these issues, but existing methods remain inefficient.

Method: A$^2$LC integrates an automated correction mechanism leveraging annotator feedback to refine labels beyond queried samples and introduces an adaptively balanced acquisition function targeting underrepresented classes.

Result: A$^2$LC significantly improves efficiency, performing better than previous methods while using only 20% of their budget. It achieves a 27.23% performance improvement under the same budget on the Cityscapes dataset.

Conclusion: A$^2$LC is a cost-efficient and high-performing framework for correcting semantic segmentation labels, addressing inefficiencies in prior solutions.

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal approach leveraging phase and Doppler Shift data for WiFi-based human behavior recognition, achieving enhanced recognition accuracy through feature interaction and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WiFi-based human behavior recognition methods neglect the interaction and fusion of multiple modalities, limiting recognition accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a dual-branch self-attention module for spatial-temporal cue extraction and a gating mechanism for optimizing feature interaction between phase and Doppler Shift data.

Result: Experiments on datasets Widar3.0 and XRF55 show superior performance of the proposed method in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves recognition accuracy by enabling cross-modal collaborative awareness, demonstrating practical significance for advanced behavior recognition systems.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

*Xu Wang,Shengeng Tang,Lechao Cheng,Feng Li,Shuo Wang,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T dataset and introduces SignAligner, a new method for realistic sign language video generation via a three-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of sign language, involving intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements, has made realistic and naturalistic sign language generation a persistent challenge.

Method: The method proposed, called SignAligner, has three stages: text-driven pose co-generation using a Transformer-based text encoder, online collaborative correction using weighted dynamic loss and cross-modal attention, and the synthesis of high-fidelity sign videos using a video generation model.

Result: Experiments show that SignAligner improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the generated sign language videos, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SignAligner successfully addresses the challenges of producing realistic sign language representations by refining pose modalities and integrating multimodal features, contributing to advancements in sign language generation.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces new techniques to evaluate fairness in machine learning for image classification tasks related to skin color, using probability distributions and statistical distance measures rather than rigid categorizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness issues arising from the representation of skin color in machine learning, which differs from categorical sensitive attributes like gender and race.

Method: Proposed converting tensor data of skin color into probability distributions and leveraged Bayesian regression with polynomial functions for color distance estimates in training.

Result: Developed methods that capture nuances in fairness both within and across traditional groups, offering a more equitable treatment of skin color.

Conclusion: The novel technique and training method contribute to mitigating biases in image classification tasks while ensuring fairness across diverse skin tones.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

### [179] [DISCO: Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning with Conditional Distance Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11653)
*Emre Kavak,Tom Nuno Wolf,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standard anti-causal prediction model (SAM) and a novel regularization strategy called DISCO to ensure models focus on genuine causal factors rather than spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to prevent predictive models from relying on spurious correlations, such as lighting conditions, which could lead to biased or irrelevant predictions.

Method: The paper develops a causal framework and employs a conditional independence criterion to ensure models focus on genuine causal pathways. It also introduces DISCO, utilizing conditional distance correlation for bias mitigation.

Result: DISCO demonstrates competitive performance in mitigating bias across various experiments, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SAM and DISCO collectively contribute to creating fairer, more robust models by eliminating reliance on causally irrelevant signals.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

*Yunhan Ren,Ruihuang Li,Lingbo Liu,Changwen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles prohibited item detection in X-ray images using an occlusion-aware segmentation pipeline that incorporates SAM and a custom bilayer mask module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving instance segmentation in X-ray images where prohibited items differ significantly in appearance from natural objects and often overlap heavily.

Method: The approach integrates SAM for generalization and employs an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module for handling overlapping objects.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced segmentation performance on newly annotated datasets PIDray-A and PIXray-A.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses segmentation challenges in X-ray imagery, offering improved accuracy and publicly available datasets and codes.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

*Chendi Ge,Xin Wang,Zeyang Zhang,Hong Chen,Jiapei Fan,Longtao Huang,Hui Xue,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "D-MoLE," a novel method for dynamically adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks by continuously updating and fine-tuning their architecture within a fixed parameter budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to adapt to new tasks due to fixed architectures and static model capacities, leading to challenges like task architecture conflicts and modality imbalances.

Method: The proposed D-MoLE method dynamically evolves the model's architecture. It uses a layer-wise expert allocator to distribute LoRA experts adaptively and implements a gradient-based inter-modal curriculum to balance updates across modalities.

Result: Experimental results show that D-MoLE surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of 15% improvement over the best competing approach.

Conclusion: D-MoLE effectively resolves the challenges of continual learning for MLLMs by introducing a dynamic and adaptive architectural approach, paving the way for more versatile and balanced task adaptation.

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

### [182] [Cross-Modal Clustering-Guided Negative Sampling for Self-Supervised Joint Learning from Medical Images and Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11674)
*Libin Lan,Hongxing Li,Zunhui Xia,Juan Zhou,Xiaofei Zhu,Yongmei Li,Yudong Zhang,Xin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve multimodal self-supervised learning for medical image representations by focusing on better negative sampling and low-level feature retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for learning medical visual representations suffer from issues like neglecting hard negatives, overlooking fine-grained details, and emphasizing only high-level features.

Method: The proposed method employs Cross-Modal Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) for enhanced negative sampling using k-means clustering, and Cross-Modal Masked Image Reconstruction (CM-MIR) to retain low-level image features.

Result: Experimental results show the method's superior performance in classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations in current models by enhancing cross-modal interaction and focusing on both high-level and low-level features, advancing digital diagnosis capabilities.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

*Zacharia Mesbah,Dhruv Jain,Tsiry Mayet,Romain Modzelewski,Romain Herault,Simon Bernard,Sebastien Thureau,Clement Chatelain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study outlines a three-stage approach leveraging imaging biomarkers to predict survival outcomes in lung fibrosis patients, involving segmentation, feature extraction, and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and evaluate the predictive power of airway imaging biomarkers for determining survival outcomes in lung fibrosis patients.

Method: The study used a segmentation network (nn-Unet) for airway structural delineation, followed by feature extraction from tracheal and airway areas, and employed an SVM classifier to analyze these features.

Result: Achieved an overall score of 0.8601 for segmentation (Task 1) and 0.7346 for classification (Task 2).

Conclusion: The proposed methodology demonstrates the potential of airway-related biomarkers and radiomic features in predicting lung fibrosis survival outcomes with notable performance.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates human action recognition using the COCO dataset and finds that Vision Transformer (ViT) outperforms other models, achieving 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the efficacy of different architectures, including transformers, for human action recognition using subsets of the COCO image dataset.

Method: Benchmarked various models, including simple fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and transformer-based architectures like ViT. Used statistical analysis (ANOVA) and explainability tools (SHAP explainer, LeGrad heatmaps).

Result: The ViT model achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming convolutional networks (35%) and CLIP-based models (62-64%). Statistical significance was confirmed, and ViT demonstrated better attention to action-relevant regions.

Conclusion: ViT excels in data efficiency and performance for action recognition. Explainability techniques are crucial for identifying and diagnosing model-specific misclassifications.

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTabVQA, a novel benchmark for multi-tabular visual question answering, addressing challenges in interpreting and reasoning across multi-tabular data with Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with parsing multi-tabular data from images and reasoning over it, which is a significant real-world challenge not adequately addressed by existing benchmarks.

Method: The authors developed MTabVQA, comprising 3,745 complex question-answer pairs requiring multi-hop reasoning across table images. They also introduced MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale dataset for fine-tuning VLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Extensive benchmarks showed state-of-the-art VLMs performed poorly on the MTabVQA benchmark, but fine-tuning these models with MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improved their performance on multi-tabular reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The introduction of MTabVQA and MTabVQA-Instruct highlights critical gaps in current VLMs' reasoning abilities and provides tools to address these limitations, demonstrating the potential of fine-tuning for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMAF-Net, a novel approach for incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation to handle modality imbalance and missing information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fall short in managing modality imbalance and structural relationships in real-world scenarios, affecting the performance of medical image segmentation.

Method: DMAF-Net employs dynamic fusion through transformer attention, introduces a distillation framework for feature alignment and prototype consistency, and incorporates dynamic training monitoring to address imbalance.

Result: Experimental results show that DMAF-Net surpasses diverse existing methods in segmentation tasks on the BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 datasets.

Conclusion: DMAF-Net effectively addresses limitations in incomplete multi-modal segmentation and demonstrates superior performance, providing valuable insights to the medical imaging community.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

Result: The standard model excelled in vision-heavy tasks, while the DCI-enhanced version performed better on datasets requiring semantic coherence or structured understanding.

Conclusion: Plug-and-play techniques like DCI can strengthen foundation models like LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave in specific contexts.

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based

compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery by super-resolving Sentinel-2 images.

Method: DiffFuSR uses a two-stage pipeline with a diffusion-based model trained on RGB imagery and a fusion network for multispectral bands.

Result: The proposed pipeline outperformed existing methods in reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency, spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression.

Conclusion: Harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion strategies provides an effective modular framework for Sentinel-2 image super-resolution.

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

TL;DR: MambaVSR introduces a new framework using state-space models for video super-resolution (VSR) to address large motion displacements and efficiently handle long video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSR methods are inefficient with large motion displacements and long video sequences, relying heavily on methods like optical flow or transformers.

Method: Combines innovative modules (SCC and CAS) that dynamically integrate spatiotemporal interactions and a GLSSB block for enhanced feature propagation to recover details.

Result: MambaVSR outperforms Transformer-based methods on the REDS dataset, achieving a 0.58 dB PSNR improvement with 55% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MambaVSR delivers efficient, higher-quality VSR results and advances the modeling of long-range dependencies within video frames.

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address challenges in anomaly detection including ambiguity in anomaly definition, diversity in anomaly types, and scarcity of training data.

Method: The method involves combining a CLIP-based discriminative model for global features with a diffusion-based generative model for local details, and utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps for effective anomaly detection.

Result: CLIPFUSION outperformed baseline methods on benchmark datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA in anomaly segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: The authors concluded that multi-modal and multi-model fusion is an effective and scalable solution to the challenges in anomaly detection, making it applicable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of diverse, large-scale labeled datasets for smart home-based HAR systems due to variabilities in user behavior, home layouts, and sensor configurations.

Method: AgentSense generates personas using Large Language Models to simulate daily routines, decomposes them into action sequences, and executes these actions in VirtualHome—a simulated environment equipped with virtual sensors.

Result: Across five benchmark HAR datasets, the generated virtual sensor data significantly improves model performance, especially when real-world data is scarce. Models trained with virtual data and limited real data perform comparably to models trained on entire real datasets.

Conclusion: The results highlight the effectiveness of virtual datasets in overcoming the challenges of limited annotated real-world data, offering an efficient alternative without the need for manual data collection efforts.

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

### [193] [Real-Time Feedback and Benchmark Dataset for Isometric Pose Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11774)
*Abhishek Jaiswal,Armeet Singh Luthra,Purav Jangir,Bhavya Garg,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses risks in unsupervised isometric exercises by proposing a feedback system, releasing a large dataset, and creating evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks and inefficiencies of unsupervised isometric exercises, such as incorrect posture, injury, and lack of engagement.

Method: The authors created a large dataset with over 3,600 video clips of six isometric poses, benchmarked state-of-the-art models, and designed a three-part evaluation metric.

Result: They provided robust benchmarks for evaluating models and demonstrated the feasibility of a real-time feedback system for home fitness training.

Conclusion: The system can revolutionize exercise training at home and expand its utility to areas like rehabilitation and physiotherapy, ensuring accuracy and user engagement.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

*Divyanshu Mishra,Mohammadreza Salehi,Pramit Saha,Olga Patey,Aris T. Papageorghiou,Yuki M. Asano,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DISCOVR, a self-supervised learning framework designed for echocardiography (heart ultrasound) video representation learning by combining spatial and temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in echocardiography arise due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL methods are ineffective due to issues like intersample similarity and insensitivity to clinical nuances.

Method: DISCOVR uses a dual branch framework combining a clustering-based video encoder for temporal modeling and an online image encoder for spatial semantics. A semantic cluster distillation loss is introduced to transfer anatomical knowledge between these branches.

Result: DISCOVR outperforms existing SSL and specialized methods in anomaly detection, zero-shot setups, linear probing, and segmentation transfer across diverse echocardiography datasets.

Conclusion: DISCOVR demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling heart ultrasound videos, providing temporally coherent and semantically rich representations for improved downstream tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

### [195] [GPLQ: A General, Practical, and Lightning QAT Method for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11784)
*Guang Liang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPLQ, a novel framework for efficient and effective quantization of Vision Transformers (ViTs), achieving competitive 4-bit model performance while being computationally faster and less memory-intensive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods (PTQ and QAT) for ViTs have significant drawbacks such as accuracy loss, high computational costs, and poor generalization, necessitating a better approach.

Method: GPLQ uses a 2-stage sequential strategy: Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32 and quantizes activations with a feature mimicking loss in 1 epoch to preserve optimization basin; Stage 2 applies PTQ to quantize weights.

Result: GPLQ is 100x faster than QAT, reduces memory usage below FP32 training levels, and delivers 4-bit models that are competitive with FP32 models in accuracy and generalization across tasks like classification and object detection.

Conclusion: GPLQ addresses key limitations of prior quantization methods, providing a practical and efficient solution for ViT quantization, and will be released as an open-source toolkit.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates object detection in Teleoperated Driving (TD) using point cloud data, focusing on compression and detection efficiency, and network performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving safety in Teleoperated Driving (TD) by enhancing object detection capabilities using point cloud data, amidst the growing use of interconnected devices.

Method: The study uses the SELMA dataset, evaluating state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object detectors through metrics such as compression efficiency, inference time, and detection accuracy, while considering their effects on network performance in TD.

Result: The evaluation considers compression efficiency, inference time, detection accuracy, and measures the impact on V2X network data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements.

Conclusion: Effective object detection and compression methods are crucial for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Teleoperated Driving under current technological and network constraints.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates Vision-Language Translation (VLT) by addressing dataset quality gaps, benchmarking existing models, and proposing a new evaluation metric and strategy for model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation and understanding of multilingual models’ performance on VLT, particularly focusing on data quality, model dependency, and reliable evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors introduced a human-verified dataset (AibTrans), benchmarked 17 models, and proposed a new metric (DA Score) for evaluating VLT under varying complexities. They also developed a balanced multilingual fine-tuning approach.

Result: The study identified limitations in datasets, dependency on OCR, and metric reliability issues. The proposed strategies improved generalization in VLT models without degrading their cross-lingual performance.

Conclusion: Comprehensive benchmarking and new strategies for datasets, metrics, and fine-tuning can significantly improve the reliability and performance of models on VLT tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D object detection method using cameras, achieving competitive results efficiently, without relying on LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more cost-effective and widely accessible alternative to LiDAR for autonomous driving while ensuring accurate 3D object detection.

Method: They develop a pipeline that converts 2D vision-based detections into 3D detections using a 2D CNN to process the point cloud for each 2D detection, minimizing computational effort.

Result: The method achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based methods with only a third of the runtime, validated on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for 3D object detection, expanding its applicability to all road users and not just cars.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereDrag is a new framework for panoramic image editing that addresses challenges like boundary discontinuity and uneven pixel density, with experiments confirming substantial improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of efficient editing methods for panoramic images, which face unique geometric challenges such as distortion, boundary discontinuities, and pixel density variations.

Method: Introduce a framework called SphereDrag, which uses adaptive reprojection, great-circle trajectory adjustment, and spherical search region tracking to handle the geometric challenges of panoramic images. Additionally, a benchmark named PanoBench is constructed for standardized evaluation.

Result: SphereDrag demonstrates significant improvement in geometric consistency and image quality over existing methods, achieving up to a 10.5% relative improvement.

Conclusion: SphereDrag provides an effective solution for accurate and controllable editing of panoramic images, paving the way for advancements in this underexplored area.

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for accurate resolution assessment tools for satellite-derived 3D data, especially for applications in large-scale scene modeling where alternative methods like airborne lidar may not be feasible.

Method: The researchers propose automated evaluation tools and workflows that measure the resolution of satellite-derived 3D data, comparing it to high-resolution airborne lidar for validation.

Result: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods by analyzing datasets of varying quality.

*F. Gao,Y Li,X He,J Sun,J Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O2Former is a new framework for instance segmentation of ships in SAR imagery that improves performance by optimizing query generation and embedding orientation-aware features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing SAR instance segmentation methods, such as difficulty in handling scale variation, object density, and fuzzy boundaries.

Method: Introduced O2Former, enhancing Mask2Former framework with Optimized Query Generator for better feature interaction and Orientation-Aware Embedding Module for directional sensitivity.

Result: O2Former demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in segmenting ships in SAR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles challenges in SAR imagery segmentation and showcases strong generalization and precision.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

*Min-Seop Kwak,Junho Kim,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Taekyoung Kim,Seungryong Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for aligned novel view synthesis of images and geometry using warping-and-inpainting techniques, achieving improved results without the need for dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis often require dense posed images or are constrained by pose-embedded generative models limited to specific in-domain views. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by developing a method that can generalize well and generate high-quality and geometrically aligned output.

Method: The proposed method employs off-the-shelf geometry predictors to obtain partial geometries and treats novel-view synthesis as an inpainting problem for both image and geometry. Cross-modal attention distillation is used to align image and geometry branches by injecting attention maps into the geometry diffusion branch. Proximity-based mesh conditioning integrates depth and normal cues to refine the geometrical output.

Result: The method achieves high fidelity in novel view synthesis for both images and geometry in unseen scenes, produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds, and ensures competitive reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust and synergistic system for novel view image and geometry generation, outperforming prior methods while requiring less restrictive input data and achieving high levels of fidelity and alignment.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

TL;DR: The study compares a smartphone-based deep learning eye tracker against a commercial infrared tracker, finding comparable accuracy but variable sensitivity to factors like lighting and age.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if appearance-based gaze estimation can be feasible and effective under real-world mobile conditions.

Method: The study uses a MobileNet-V3 and Long Short-Term Memory-based algorithm to predict gaze, comparing its performance against a Tobii Pro Nano on data from 51 participants.

Result: The deep learning model had a mean error of 17.76 mm compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. Accuracy variations were noted due to factors like lighting, age, and vision correction.

Conclusion: Appearance-based deep learning eye tracking shows promise for mobile applications but requires further optimization for diverse conditions like low light and specific user demographics.

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

*Constantin Venhoff,Ashkan Khakzar,Sonia Joseph,Philip Torr,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the mechanisms of visual-linguistic alignment in Vision-Language Models by training a linear adapter between a frozen language model and a vision transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve how visual and linguistic representations align in vision-language models.

Method: The study freezes a large language model (LLM) and a vision transformer (ViT), connecting them via a linear adapter, which maps visual features directly to the LLM's existing representational space. Sparse autoencoders are used as probes to analyze feature alignment.

Result: Analysis reveals that visual features progressively align with language features, particularly in middle-to-later layers, exposing disparities in early layer alignment.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a potential suboptimality in current adapter-based architectures, prompting reconsideration of cross-modal representation learning strategies.

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Thought Graph Traversal (TGT), a lightweight framework to improve radiology report generation by enhancing reasoning through organ-specific findings and medical priors, all without modifying the vision-language large models (VLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of improving the accuracy and coherence of radiology report generation by leveraging reasoning enhancements without requiring additional model training.

Method: The authors propose the Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework, which integrates structured medical priors into prompts and uses a reasoning budget forcing strategy for deeper inference. This approach allows VLLMs to generate detailed and logically coherent radiology reports.

Result: The method enables frozen radiology VLLMs to self-correct and produce more consistent and accurate chest X-ray reports, outperforming baseline prompting techniques on benchmarks while exposing dataset biases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that test-time adjustments via TGT combined with reasoning budget forcing can significantly enhance medical reasoning in VLLMs, proving the practicality of this scalable approach for chest X-ray reporting.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGR introduces an advanced multimodal LLM for detailed visual reasoning tasks by integrating region-based image replay into its method, yielding superior benchmark performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal CoT reasoning models suffer from language bias and are limited to math/science, and they struggle with complex visual reasoning tasks requiring fine-grained image understanding.

Method: The introduced VGR model detects relevant image regions, replays these regions into reasoning processes, and employs a specialized SFT dataset to improve mixed vision-language reasoning.

Result: VGR surpasses LLaVA-NeXT-7B in multimodal benchmarks, improving scoring metrics by +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and +12.9 on ChartQA while reducing image token use by 70%.

Conclusion: VGR stands as a novel solution for multimodal reasoning, significantly enhancing visual perception and reasoning capabilities using less computational resources.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates whether CT-derived body composition metrics can predict 1-year mortality and postoperative outcomes after colectomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the potential of body composition metrics extracted from preoperative CT scans to improve predictive capabilities for colectomy outcomes.

Method: Utilized a Cox proportional hazards model for mortality prediction and logistic regression for secondary outcomes, integrating CT features with body composition metrics.

Result: Over 300 CT-based features were analyzed for their predictive ability on mortality, complications, and other postoperative outcomes.

Conclusion: CT-derived body composition metrics provide valuable predictive information for colectomy outcomes, alone or in combination with clinical variables.

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

*Junha Lee,Eunha Park,Chunghyun Park,Dahyun Kang,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Affogato introduces a dataset to advance affordance grounding, paired with vision-language models that achieve strong results on localization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable intelligent agents to better understand and interact with environments by resolving challenges in affordance grounding, such as fine-grained localization, ambiguity, and data scarcity.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset with 150K instances of text descriptions and 3D heatmaps, and developed vision-language models using part-aware vision backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder.

Result: The models demonstrated strong performance on existing benchmarks and excelled in open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The release of the Affogato dataset and associated models pushes forward research in affordance grounding for intelligent systems.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

### [209] [SwiftSpec: Ultra-Low Latency LLM Decoding by Scaling Asynchronous Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11309)
*Ziyi Zhang,Ziheng Jiang,Chengquan Jiang,Menghan Yu,Size Zheng,Haibin Lin,Henry Hoffmann,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwiftSpec, a system designed to lower latency in generating outputs from large language models, achieving significant speedups by redesigning speculative decoding pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accelerating LLM decoding face limitations in combining speculative decoding and tensor parallelism due to imbalanced compute requirements and communication overheads.

Method: SwiftSpec redesigns speculative decoding pipelines into asynchronous and disaggregated systems, leveraging parallel tree generation, efficient KV cache management, and optimized computational kernels.

Result: SwiftSpec demonstrated an average speedup of 1.75x over current speculative decoding methods and delivered record performance for Llama3-70B with 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs.

Conclusion: SwiftSpec establishes itself as a state-of-the-art solution for ultra-low latency LLM decoding, resolving key limitations and providing scalability for large language model applications.

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

*Zhouheng Du,Nima Davari,Li Li,Nodir Kodirov*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Capsule is a mechanism enabling multiple players to share a single GPU for cloud gaming, increasing datacenter usage up to 2.25x without degrading gaming experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud gaming datacenter resources are underutilized because game engines are mostly designed for single-player use, leading to wasted GPU capacity.

Method: Capsule was implemented into the O3DE game engine, allowing seamless GPU sharing among multiple players without requiring changes to the gaming applications.

Result: Evaluations of Capsule showed increased datacenter resource utilization, supporting up to 2.25 times more players without impacting gaming performance. It worked across various applications without modifications.

Conclusion: Capsule offers a practical and application-agnostic solution to optimize GPU utilization in cloud datacenters, and its design can be applied to multiple game engines.

Abstract: Cloud gaming is increasingly popular. A challenge for cloud provider is to
keep datacenter utilization high: a non-trivial task due to application
variety. These applications come in different shapes and sizes. So do cloud
datacenter resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs, NPUs.
  Part of the challenge stems from game engines being predominantly designed to
run only one player. One player in a lightweight game might utilize only a
fraction of the cloud server GPU. The remaining GPU capacity will be left
underutilized, an undesired outcome for the cloud provider. We introduce
Capsule, a mechanism that allows multiple players to seamlessly share one GPU.
  We implemented Capsule in O3DE, a popular open source game engine. Our
evaluations show that Capsule can increase datacenter resource utilization by
accommodating up to 2.25x more players, without degrading player gaming
experience. Capsule is also application agnostic. We ran four applications on
Capsule-based O3DE with no application changes. Our experiences show that
Capsule design can be adopted by other game engines to increase datacenter
utilization across cloud providers.

*Ran Ben Basat,Keren Censor-Hillel,Yi-Jun Chang,Wenchen Han,Dean Leitersdorf,Gregory Schwartzman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the \mu-CONGEST model, extending the CONGEST model to include memory constraints aligned with practical systems. It provides algorithms addressing memory limitations and explores the tradeoffs in performance and memory, along with efficient simulations of streaming algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existence of memory limitations in datacenter networks creates challenges for adapting theoretical distributed algorithms to practical systems.

Method: Proposed the \mu-CONGEST model with memory constraints, developed lower bounds and algorithms addressing these constraints, and efficiently simulated streaming algorithms in this model.

Result: Tight tradeoffs were provided between memory and round complexity, alongside efficient techniques for streaming algorithm simulations that address real-world memory challenges.

Conclusion: The \mu-CONGEST model bridges theoretical gaps by addressing practical memory limits, providing efficient solutions for distributed algorithm adaptation in data networks.

Abstract: The recent advent of programmable switches makes distributed algorithms
readily deployable in real-world datacenter networks. However, there are still
gaps between theory and practice that prevent the smooth adaptation of CONGEST
algorithms to these environments. In this paper, we focus on the memory
restrictions that arise in real-world deployments. We introduce the
$\mu$-CONGEST model where on top of the bandwidth restriction, the memory of
nodes is also limited to $\mu$ words, in line with real-world systems. We
provide fast algorithms of two main flavors.
  First, we observe that many algorithms in the CONGEST model are
memory-intensive and do not work in $\mu$-CONGEST. A prime example of a family
of algorithms that use large memory is clique-listing algorithms. We show that
the memory issue that arises here cannot be resolved without incurring a cost
in the round complexity, by establishing a lower bound on the round complexity
of listing cliques in $\mu$-CONGEST. We introduce novel techniques to overcome
these issues and generalize the algorithms to work within a given memory bound.
Combined with our lower bound, these provide tight tradeoffs between the
running time and memory of nodes.
  Second, we show that it is possible to efficiently simulate various families
of streaming algorithms in $\mu$-CONGEST. These include fast simulations of
$p$-pass algorithms, random order streams, and various types of mergeable
streaming algorithms.
  Combining our contributions, we show that we can use streaming algorithms to
efficiently generate statistics regarding combinatorial structures in the
network. An example of an end result of this type is that we can efficiently
identify and provide the per-color frequencies of the frequent monochromatic
triangles in $\mu$-CONGEST.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The DISPEED project addresses security threats in drone swarms by efficiently deploying network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) using the heterogeneous resources of drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security in autonomous drone swarms is threatened by malicious behaviors. Resource-efficient NIDS deployment is needed given drones' constrained computing capabilities.

Method: The project has two phases: characterization of IDS implementations on embedded platforms, and mapping strategies for selecting the most context-relevant NIDSs.

Result: 36 IDS implementations were evaluated on Raspberry Pi 4B, Jetson Xavier, and Pynq-Z2 platforms. Standalone and distributed strategies for NIDS selection were designed.

Conclusion: DISPEED demonstrated effective deployment of NIDS within resource-limited drone swarms, resulting in multiple publications highlighting its success.

Abstract: Swarms of drones are gaining more and more autonomy and efficiency during
their missions. However, security threats can disrupt their missions'
progression. To overcome this problem, Network Intrusion Detection Systems
((N)IDS) are promising solutions to detect malicious behavior on network
traffic. However, modern NIDS rely on resource-hungry machine learning
techniques, that can be difficult to deploy on a swarm of drones. The goal of
the DISPEED project is to leverage the heterogeneity (execution platforms,
memory) of the drones composing a swarm to deploy NIDS. It is decomposed in two
phases: (1) a characterization phase that consists in characterizing various
IDS implementations on diverse embedded platforms, and (2) an IDS
implementation mapping phase that seeks to develop selection strategies to
choose the most relevant NIDS depending on the context. On the one hand, the
characterization phase allowed us to identify 36 relevant IDS implementations
on three different embedded platforms: a Raspberry Pi 4B, a Jetson Xavier, and
a Pynq-Z2. On the other hand, the IDS implementation mapping phase allowed us
to design both standalone and distributed strategies to choose the best NIDSs
to deploy depending on the context. The results of the project have led to
three publications in international conferences, and one publication in a
journal.

*Kevin Cogan,Vuong M. Ngo,Mark Roantree*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning is used for dyslexia detection, achieving an 88.58% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dyslexia affects up to 20% of the global population, requiring accessible and innovative diagnostic solutions.

Method: Eye movement analyses were conducted, identifying features like fixation durations and saccades, and assessed with a Random Forest Classifier and hierarchical clustering.

Result: The machine learning model demonstrated an 88.58% accuracy in predicting dyslexia and identified varying severity levels via clustering.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking paired with machine learning offers a non-invasive, accurate, and accessible approach to diagnose dyslexia efficiently.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a holistic view of 'essential data science,' focusing on challenges and missions arising from 5D complexities of data. It proposes an integrated ecosystem to address divergence between computational and foundational data science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between computational and foundational data science, while creating an integrated ecosystem connecting discipline-specific and general data science.

Method: The authors conceptualize data science as an ecosystem involving data agents and missions rooted in the data universe's 5D complexities, and suggest measurements of usefulness for data discoveries.

Result: The framework defines specific discipline-induced data science and 'pan-data science' while highlighting potential divergence threats between subdomains.

Conclusion: Rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data discoveries could mitigate divergence between computational and foundational data science.

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

*Minhyuk Seo,Taeheon Kim,Hankook Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) that addresses challenges like data and model heterogeneity, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in personalization and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, transmission costs, and the growing need for personalized AI in real-world scenarios, while also tackling challenges like heterogeneous data and model architectures in Personalized Federated Learning.

Method: Proposed a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method for data heterogeneity and a dimension-invariant module for knowledge sharing across heterogeneous model architectures.

Result: Demonstrated that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a new multi-modal PFL benchmark with 40 tasks, excelling in both personalization and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed methods make significant strides in solving data and model heterogeneity in PFL, setting new benchmarks for real-world applicability in multi-modal tasks while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving code generation in less popular programming languages using a combination of the Qwen 2.5 model and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), with Prolog as the case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of extensive public training data for certain programming languages creates challenges for generating accurate and executable code using large language models.

Method: The paper employs a small-scale version of the Qwen 2.5 language model alongside GRPO, incorporating reasoning-driven feedback into reinforcement learning to optimize code generation.

Result: The approach improved the model's capability to generate logically consistent, syntactically accurate, and executable code in Prolog, validated through mathematical logic problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: This methodology has the potential to generalize to other programming languages with limited training resources, enhancing reasoning and code quality.

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore biases in AI systems, particularly focusing on how appearance influences algorithmic performance and fairness.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments using 13,200 synthetically generated faces to examine biases in text-to-image generation and gender classification algorithms.

Result: They discovered that AI systems link attractiveness to unrelated positive traits and show higher error rates for less-attractive, non-White female faces in gender classification.

Conclusion: The findings underline significant fairness challenges in digital identity systems and emphasize the need for addressing biases in AI models.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital

TL;DR: This paper evaluates four synthetic data generation methods for developing privacy-preserving energy systems using dynamic Time-of-Use tariffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Time-of-Use electricity tariffs can benefit households but raise privacy concerns when using real consumption data, necessitating synthetic alternatives.

Method: The study compares WGAN, CTGAN, Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation under different synthetic regimes, assessing classification utility, distribution fidelity, and privacy leakage.

Result: Diffusion Models achieved the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while CTGAN showed the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: Structured generative models like Diffusion Models and CTGAN hold significant potential for creating data-driven energy systems that balance utility and privacy.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the role of mobility data and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in disease outbreak prediction and finds that mortality and hospitalization data significantly improve forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between machine learning performance and its real-world epidemiological applications, especially regarding mobility data.

Method: A two-phase process: 1) pilot study on mobility data, and 2) evaluation of GCNs on a transformer backbone to assess forecasting accuracy.

Result: Mobility data and GCN modules had limited impact on forecasting, but using mortality and hospitalization data greatly improved model accuracy. GCN spatial maps correlated noticeably with lockdown orders.

Conclusion: Mortality and hospitalization data hold greater promise for improving outbreak predictions than mobility data, with spatial maps offering a potential tool for mobility representation in predictive models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces YingLong, a non-causal bidirectional transformer for time series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significant advancements in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for time series prediction using direct or recursive approaches often lack scalability and generalization across diverse datasets. This paper aims to improve these aspects using a novel framework and foundation model.

Method: YingLong is trained using masked token recovery in a non-causal bidirectional manner, complemented by a multi-input ensemble to reduce output variance. Four versions of YingLong were released, scaling from 6M to 300M parameters.

Result: The YingLong model demonstrated over 60% state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperformed existing models by 14% and 44% in comparison to foundation and end-to-end models, respectively, validated across multiple domains using the GIFT-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: YingLong provides groundbreaking improvements in time series forecasting with its non-causal approach and scaling strategies, outperforming traditional methods and other models in accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

Motivation: Backpropagation (BP), despite its success, has major limitations such as biologically implausible backward error propagation, reliance on symmetric weights, and inefficiency in low-precision and emerging hardware scenarios.

Method: The proposed Forward Target Propagation (FTP) eliminates backward passes by introducing a second forward pass, relying on feedforward computations to estimate layerwise targets. It removes the need for symmetric feedback and uses modular and local learning.

Result: FTP achieves comparable accuracies with BP on benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, models long-term dependencies in sequential tasks, and outperforms BP under hardware constraints such as quantized low-precision computations.

Conclusion: FTP is a biologically plausible, forward-only, and hardware-efficient learning algorithm that offers energy efficiency and compatibility for neuromorphic and on-device learning.

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

### [223] [Task-aligned prompting improves zero-shot detection of AI-generated images by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11031)
*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images, proposing a task-aligned prompting method that significantly improves accuracy and generalization without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasingly realistic AI-generated images raise concerns about misuse, and supervised detection methods struggle with generalization across different image sources.

Method: The researchers use pre-trained VLMs and propose task-aligned prompting techniques, particularly a method called zero-shot-s$^2$, which enhances the model's reasoning through specific phrasing strategies.

Result: The zero-shot-s$^2$ method increases Macro F1 scores by 8%-29%, shows generalization across diverse datasets and models, exhibits robustness to model scale, and outperforms conventional Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Conclusion: Task-aligned prompts enhance latent capabilities in VLMs for detecting AI-generated images, offering a simple and generalizable alternative to supervised methods while being effective across diverse datasets and models.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

### [224] [An Active Learning-Based Streaming Pipeline for Reduced Data Training of Structure Finding Models in Neutron Diffractometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11100)
*Tianle Wang,Jorge Ramirez,Cristina Garcia-Cardona,Thomas Proffen,Shantenu Jha,Sudip K. Seal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a batch-mode active learning policy to reduce training data and accelerate machine learning for neutron diffractometry structure determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structure determination in neutron diffractometry is time and resource-intensive, posing challenges for faster, efficient computational solutions.

Method: The authors propose an active learning approach using uncertainty sampling to optimize the selection of simulated training data, coupled with a stream-based workflow.

Result: The novel method reduces training data needs by 75%, improves accuracy, and shortens training time by 20% compared to conventional workflows.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning for neutron diffractometry tasks, proving its practical benefits.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

*Minjae Kwon,Tyler Ingebrand,Ufuk Topcu,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a runtime safety mechanism for reinforcement learning robots facing hidden parameter variations, using constrained Markov decision processes and probabilistic guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variations in a robot's hidden parameters, such as mass distribution or friction, can jeopardize safety during tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a runtime shielding mechanism based on hidden-parameter Markov decision processes, incorporating function encoders for real-time parameter inference and conformal prediction for uncertainty management.

Result: The system significantly reduces safety violations, ensures strong generalization even for unseen conditions, and operates with minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: The method achieves probabilistic safety guarantees and optimal safety-compliant policies, proving effective and efficient in experiments with diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

*Yilan Chen,Zhichao Wang,Wei Huang,Andi Han,Taiji Suzuki,Arya Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a generalization bound for gradient flow using a novel data-dependent loss path kernel (LPK) that captures the entire optimization trajectory and adapts to data and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between the empirical success of gradient-based optimization methods and their theoretical understanding in terms of generalization properties.

Method: The method involves linking gradient flow generalization bounds with classical Rademacher complexity bounds and introducing the LPK, which adapts dynamically along the training trajectory.

Result: It is demonstrated that the LPK leads to tighter generalization guarantees than static kernels like the NTK, and the influence of optimization dynamics on generalization performance is highlighted.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed generalization bounds correlate well with the true generalization gap in real-world datasets, showing the relevance of the dynamic kernel framework.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CausalVLBench, a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) on visual causal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research on LVLMs' capabilities in causal reasoning tasks and establish a formal benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning.

Method: The authors proposed CausalVLBench, covering tasks like causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction, and evaluated LVLMs on three causal datasets.

Result: The evaluation reveals key strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art LVLMs in visual causal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights deficiencies in current LVLMs and aims to stimulate advancements in their visual causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

### [229] [Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11035)
*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper adapts Tversky's psychological similarity model for use in deep learning to improve interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological studies indicate that geometric models of similarity in deep learning don't align with human perception, motivating the need for a perceptually plausible similarity model.

Method: Developing a differentiable implementation of Tversky's similarity model and incorporating it into neural network layers, such as the Tversky projection layer.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements, such as a 24.7% accuracy boost in image classification and reduced perplexity and parameter count in language modeling.

Conclusion: Tversky projection layers offer better performance and interpretability compared to geometric models, aligning deep learning practices with established psychological theories.

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

*Yang Qin,Chao Chen,Zhihang Fu,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Peng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework (ICL) for improving text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) by integrating human-centered interactions and leveraging multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIReID methods struggle with distinguishing challenging images due to limitations in network architecture and quality of training data.

Method: The paper introduces a Test-time Humane-centered Interaction (THI) module which leverages multimodal interactions and visual question answering to refine query alignment, alongside a Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy to improve data quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on TIReID benchmarks show substantial performance improvements using the proposed methods.

Conclusion: By integrating human-centered interactive learning and enhanced data augmentation techniques, the method significantly boosts TIReID ranking accuracy and overcomes existing challenges in cross-modal embedding models.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework, GRePO-LTV, to improve LifeTime Value (LTV) predictions in advertising, addressing challenges like data scarcity and task interdependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a precise LTV prediction system that benefits advertisers by aligning user interests with targeted ads, despite challenges such as sparse data and correlated prediction tasks.

Method: The proposed method uses graph representation learning to tackle the data scarcity issue and Pareto-Optimization to manage interdependent tasks effectively.

Result: While results are not explicitly mentioned, the introduction of GRePO-LTV suggests advancements in LTV prediction accuracy through its novel approach.

Conclusion: The GRePO-LTV framework offers a comprehensive and effective solution for LTV prediction, addressing both data limitations and task interdependence issues.

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

*Linjie Li,Zhenyu Wu,Yang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MoTE framework to address challenges in class-incremental learning, leveraging ideas from the mixture of experts to mitigate dimensional inconsistencies and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-incremental learning requires models that can learn continuously from streaming data while preserving previously acquired knowledge.

Method: The authors propose the MoTE framework, which incorporates task-specific expert filters and joint inference mechanisms to handle dimensional alignment and prevent forgetting during classification tasks.

Result: Experiments show that the MoTE framework outperforms prompt- or adapter-based approaches, achieves scalability with linear task growth, and eliminates the need for exemplar sets.

Conclusion: MoTE effectively resolves miscalibration and overwriting issues in class-incremental learning, offering a scalable and robust solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

### [233] [Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743)
*Antonin Joly,Nicolas Keriven,Aline Roumy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a more general and flexible approach to graph coarsening, focusing on differentiating between reduction and lifting matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph coarsening is important for reducing graph size to alleviate memory burdens and improve efficiency in graph signal processing and machine learning, traditionally constrained by fixed relationships between reduction and lifting matrices.

Method: The paper proposes a new class of reduction matrices independent of the lifting matrix's pseudo-inverse, explores their admissible properties, and demonstrates optimization strategies for further minimizing the loss of information (RSA).

Result: Experiments show that the proposed framework can reduce RSA more effectively, and its impact positively influences node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.

Conclusion: Separating the design of reduction and lifting matrices can unlock better coarsening methods, reducing information loss and benefiting machine learning applications on coarsened graphs.

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) improves text-image alignment but causes color distortions at high guidance weights. The proposed Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) addresses these distortions by controlling magnitude and optimizing angular alignment, achieving better image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address color distortions caused by CFG in text-to-image synthesis at high guidance weights, while maintaining high-quality text-to-image alignment.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical analysis of norm amplification and propose the Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) method, which optimizes angular alignment and restricts magnitude variations in the latent space.

Result: ADG outperforms existing methods by improving text alignment, maintaining color fidelity, and aligning better with human perceptual preferences.

Conclusion: The ADG method overcomes the limitations of high-guidance CFG, striking a balance between text alignment and image quality, and advancing the field of text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Result: The algorithms achieve a competitive balance between computational speed and predictive accuracy, specifically tested on contextual bandit and Bayesian optimization problems in non-stationary settings.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and scalable solution for online learning in sequential decision-making tasks without needing replay buffers or offline retraining, while delivering efficient and accurate updates.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

*Xiaobao Huang,Yihong Ma,Anjali Gurajapu,Jules Schleinitz,Zhichun Guo,Sarah E. Reisman,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network designed to better model chemical reaction networks involving multiple reactants, and demonstrates its superiority over traditional graph neural networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify challenges in modeling multi-reactant interactions with GNNs in chemistry, which face limitations such as combinatorial explosion and handling chemically invalid negative samples.

Method: They propose ChemHGNN, a hypergraph framework that uses hyperedges to model multi-reactant reactions. The approach includes a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy and hierarchical embedding that integrates molecule, reaction, and hypergraph-level information.

Result: The ChemHGNN framework demonstrated superior performance over both HGNN and GNN baselines in experiments on the USPTO dataset, especially in large-scale scenarios, maintaining interpretation and chemical plausibility.

Conclusion: This work establishes hypergraph neural networks as a more effective alternative to GNNs for reaction virtual screening and discovery, providing a powerful, chemically-informed tool for accelerating reaction discovery.

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

*Baoquan Zhang,Guangning Xu,Michael. K. Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFT leverages pretrained model weights for efficient task-specific fine-tuning, outperforming state-of-the-art PEFT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently adapt pretrained foundation models (PFMs) for customized downstream tasks while avoiding the inefficiency of training parameter updates from scratch.

Method: The authors propose GenFT, a method that extracts structured information from pretrained weights ($W_0$) using row and column transformations, and employs a policy to decompose parameter updates ($\Delta W$) into shared and specific components.

Result: GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across various benchmarks, including VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE, in both computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

Conclusion: GenFT introduces a novel and effective approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, enabling better model adaptation to downstream tasks by leveraging structured information from pretrained weights.

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

*Korbinian Pöppel,Richard Freinschlag,Thomas Schmied,Wei Lin,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents pLSTMs, an advanced RNN variant for handling structured data like 2D grids and DAGs, with notable improvements in long-range capability over Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNN variants like xLSTM and Mamba, while challenging Transformers, are restricted in handling multi-dimensional structured data like images and graphs when processed sequentially. There is a need for architectures better suited for higher-dimensional data.

Method: The paper introduces pLSTMs, which implement parallelizable transitions on line graphs of DAGs using Source, Transition, and Mark gates. These effectively handle structured data using logarithmic-time operations and multiple modes of long-distance information propagation.

Result: pLSTMs generalize well to tasks requiring understanding of long-distance directional information, outperform Transformers particularly in synthetic vision tasks and molecular graph/computer vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: pLSTMs address structural shortcomings of existing recurrent models, offering superior capability for sequences, multi-dimensional grids, and graphs. They reinforce the potential of linear RNN architectures in challenging the dominance of Transformers.

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

### [241] [Boost Post-Training Quantization via Null Space Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11044)
*Jiaqi Zhao,Miao Zhang,Weili Guan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new quantization method incorporating the concept of null space to reduce quantization error in large language models. The proposed approach, called Q2N, significantly improves the performance of quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for large language models show limited performance improvements, necessitating innovative approaches to enable further model compression.

Method: The authors introduce the Q2N module, which uses an efficient null space projection method to constrain post-quantization weight perturbations within the null space of input activations. A closed-form solution is derived to ensure practical inference without additional memory overhead.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) demonstrate that Q2N effectively reduces quantization error and outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: The study establishes null space optimization as a promising new direction for LLM quantization and encourages researchers to develop advanced strategies based on this insight.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RandomWorld, a pipeline for generating synthetic compositional and interactive tool-use data, improving language model performance on tool-use benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient methods for generating training data to improve tool-use capabilities in large language models, especially for reinforcement learning.

Method: RandomWorld pipeline employs procedural generation to synthesize interactive and compositional tool-use training data, optimized using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).

Result: Models trained on RandomWorld data improved performance on several tool-use benchmarks and set new state-of-the-art (SoTA) for metrics in the NESTFUL dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic data from RandomWorld shows promise for scaling and enhancing tool-use performance in language models, potentially reducing reliance on human-curated datasets.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores various data augmentation methods for improving confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs), revealing that diverse and semantically enriched augmentation strategies reduce overconfidence and increase estimation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance confidence estimation in LLMs, while addressing overconfidence issues and limitations in prior reliance solely on specific augmentation techniques.

Method: The study evaluates different data augmentation strategies and examines the factors influencing their effectiveness, focusing on semantic preservation and diversity.

Result: Findings demonstrate that semantically diverse augmentation improves model confidence estimation. Random combinations of augmentations show promise due to flexibility in parameter transferability.

Conclusion: Diverse, semantically-preserving augmentation enhances the performance of LLM confidence estimation, with random combinations being particularly effective due to their adaptability across applications.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models.
Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

*Chirudeep Tupakula,Rittika Shamsuddin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a perception-driven framework for bias detection using a crowdsourced web platform to visually identify anomalies in fairness across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bias detection methods require sensitive data or rigid fairness metrics, limiting their use in practical, real-world applications.

Method: A web platform is designed to collect judgments from users on visual data (e.g., salary distributions) to highlight disparities. This feedback is aggregated and verified statistically and through machine learning cross-validation.

Result: Human perceptions generated through the platform correlate strongly with existing known biases, proving its reliability for bias detection.

Conclusion: This innovative approach is effective, scalable, and interpretable, providing an alternative to conventional bias investigation methods by leveraging non-expert human intuition.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

*Sangwon Shin,Mehmet C. Vuran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMuSeNet, a new complex-valued neural network (CVNN) for wideband spectrum sensing, which outperforms state-of-the-art real-valued counterparts in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in radio frequency spectrum congestion using dynamic spectrum access and neural networks, specifically overcoming the limitations of real-valued neural networks in low-SNR environments.

Method: The proposed method, CMuSeNet, utilizes a complex-valued neural network with residual architecture, introduces a complex-valued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL), and a complex plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric for better training performance.

Result: CMuSeNet achieves a significant improvement in accuracy (98.98%-99.90%), up to 9.2 percentage points better than real-valued counterparts, while drastically reducing training time by 92.2% over state-of-the-art models. It quickly achieves its RVNN counterpart's accuracy in just two epochs.

Conclusion: Complex-valued architectures, as exemplified by CMuSeNet, demonstrate superior performance and efficiency in low-SNR environments for spectrum sensing, making them promising for future applications in cognitive radio systems.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSW-EPNews, a benchmark for evaluating electricity price forecasting by combining time-series data and text signals such as market news using classical models and large language models (LLMs). Traditional models gain little benefit from incorporating news, while LLMs show modest improvement but also frequent hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in incorporating textual signals like market news alongside numerical data for more effective electricity price forecasting in energy-management systems.

Method: A 48-step-ahead forecasting model is built using multimodal inputs, including lagged prices, weather features, and curated market-news summaries, assessed across traditional models and prompt-engineered LLMs using NSW-EPNews dataset.

Result: LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro showed modest improvement in accuracy but frequently hallucinated fabricated or malformed prices. Classical models experienced marginal benefits from integrating news data.

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews highlights gaps in LLMs' capability for grounded numerical reasoning in energy forecasting while providing a testbed for evaluating forecasting models in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, their application to NP-hard combinatorial problems is underexplored. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: ACCORD employs a novel dataset representation and model architecture, dynamically enforcing feasibility constraints and using attention-based routing to activate specific modules. It uses an 8B-parameter Llama backbone and introduces the ACCORD-90k dataset.

Result: Experiments show that ACCORD outperforms standard prompt-based and input-output methods, even surpassing larger models like GPT-4. Ablation studies confirm improvements in solution feasibility.

Conclusion: ACCORD is the first large-scale framework for applying LLMs to various combinatorial optimization problems, setting a benchmark in the field and showcasing the capabilities of LLMs in such complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,

*Weichang Wu,Xiaolu Zhang,Jun Zhou,Yuchen Li,Wenwen Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel pretraining strategy called "Bootstrapping Your Behavior" (BYB) for User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling, which uses automatic behavior embedding instead of manual vocabulary construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing UBS pretraining methods that rely on manually constructed behavior vocabularies, which are labor-intensive, prone to bias, and limit model generalization.

Method: The proposed method predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding for behavior data within a future time window using a student-teacher encoder approach.

Result: BYB improves AUC by 3.9% and training throughput by 98.9% in experiments on industrial datasets, achieves meaningful patterns during pretraining without labels, and shows significant performance gains in real-world deployment for financial risk prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed BYB method automates UBS pretraining, enhances model generalization, and significantly reduces manual effort, with considerable practical impact as demonstrated in both experiments and real-world applications.

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to adaptively manage Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) in dynamic IoT environments, addressing challenges like data drift and resource limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT environments exhibit uncertainties such as fluctuating data and evolving requirements, which challenge the stability and performance of MLaaS compositions.

Method: Developed an adaptive MLaaS framework that uses a service-quality assessment, a replacement selection model, and an incremental composition mechanism based on multi-armed bandit optimization.

Result: Experimental validation using a real-world dataset showed the proposed framework efficiently maintained service quality while reducing recomposition costs.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively handles IoT-specific challenges, enhancing QoS and computational efficiency for MLaaS compositions.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-driven machine learning approach to tackle data scarcity in materials science and presents the first foundation model, PolyMicros, for polycrystalline materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of limited data in materials classes like mesoscale structured metal alloys, where building large-scale datasets is prohibitive.

Method: The method involves a novel data augmentation strategy leveraging local generative models trained on very limited observations and coordinating them using a diversity curation strategy to create a large and diverse dataset.

Result: The framework enables the creation of PolyMicros, a foundation model for polycrystalline materials, which successfully addresses key challenges in 3D experimental microscopy.

Conclusion: PolyMicros demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach to handle hyper-sparse datasets in scientific domains, offering a path to revolutionize materials science through accessibility of models and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and

*Sean Memery,Kevin Denamganai,Anna Kapron-King,Kartic Subr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a method to make iterative optimization processes in inverse problems interpretable by translating optimizer traces into natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in forward model interpretability, the process of iterative optimization in inverse problems remains opaque to domain experts.

Method: The approach instruments a differentiable simulator to generate natural language events during its forward and backward passes; a Language Model then processes these events to produce explanations.

Result: The proposed method is demonstrated with an optimization problem and neural network training, showcasing its ability to produce understandable explanations.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gap between complex optimization processes and human interpretability, aiding domain experts through natural language explanations.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

*Xijun Li,Jiexiang Yang,Jinghao Wang,Bo Peng,Jianguo Yao,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRCMP is a framework for algorithm discovery in combinatorial optimization problems that integrates structural priors using GNN and LLM, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges in NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems by leveraging inherent structural priors often neglected in LLM-based approaches.

Method: The STRCMP framework combines a graph neural network to extract structural embeddings with a large language model, conditioned on these embeddings, to synthesize high-performing solver-specific codes. It also uses evolutionary refinement for iterative optimization.

Result: STRCMP achieves superior performance compared to five strong neural and LLM-based methods across nine benchmark datasets for Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, improving both solution optimality and efficiency.

Conclusion: By integrating structural priors into LLM-based algorithm discovery, STRCMP significantly enhances the quality and speed of solving combinatorial optimization problems. Its code and model will be made publicly available following acceptance.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

*Boya Xiong,Shuo Wang,Weifeng Ge,Guanhua Chen,Yun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADAMIX, a mixed-precision delta-compression method that compresses fine-tuned LLMs effectively, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and compression ratio across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing delta-compression methods for fine-tuned large language models either fail to deliver high compression ratios or rely on ad-hoc bit allocation schemes, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose ADAMIX, deriving the quantization error mathematically and optimizing a mixed-precision bit allocation scheme using 0/1 integer linear programming to minimize error under specific compression constraints.

Result: ADAMIX significantly outperformed baseline methods in various tasks and benchmarks, achieving notable improvements of 22.3% and 6.1% over Delta-CoMe on the AIME2024 and GQA tasks respectively, with 7B models.

Conclusion: ADAMIX effectively improves the trade-off between model accuracy and compression ratio, offering a superior solution for compressing fine-tuned LLMs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

### [255] [Debiasing Online Preference Learning via Preference Feature Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11098)
*Dongyoung Kim,Jinsung Yoon,Jinwoo Shin,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PFP (Preference Feature Preservation), a framework to address biased responses in LLMs caused by simplified binary/scalar preference learning. PFP introduces preference feature preservation and rich signals throughout online learning to ensure diverse and accurate human preference handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The simplification of human preferences to pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards in LLMs creates bias, particularly worsened in online preference learning iterations.

Method: PFP extracts preference features from human data, trains a feature classifier, maps appropriate features during online learning using distribution preserving optimization, and integrates these into prompts for explicit handling.

Result: PFP mitigates bias in preference features during online learning and delivers superior performance on benchmarks for LLM alignment.

Conclusion: Incorporating richer preference features and maintaining their distribution improves LLM alignment, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

*Huiling Zhu,Yingqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge graphs encode information in entities and relations, often suffering from data incompleteness. SectorE is a novel embedding model in polar coordinates that addresses semantic hierarchies, achieving competitive performance in knowledge graph completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incompleteness in knowledge graphs and improve semantic modeling capabilities, particularly focusing on the overlooked hierarchical structure inherent in entities.

Method: The proposed SectorE model represents relations as annular sectors in polar coordinates, combining modulus and phase, while embedding entities as points within these sectors to encode hierarchy intuitively.

Result: SectorE demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion tasks on datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, proving its semantic modeling strengths.

Conclusion: SectorE, through innovative geometric representation in polar coordinates, effectively captures entity hierarchies and advances the performance of knowledge graph completion models.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PromptTSS, a novel framework for effective multigranularity segmentation in multivariate time series, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multivariate time series segmentation methods struggle to handle multiple granularity levels within a unified framework and adapt to evolving dynamic patterns.

Method: PromptTSS employs a unified prompting mechanism that integrates label and boundary information, enabling segmentation across coarse and fine granularity levels and dynamic adaptation to unseen patterns.

Result: PromptTSS enhances segmentation accuracy by 24.49% for multi-granularity, 17.88% for single-granularity, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning tasks, highlighting its superior performance.

Conclusion: The framework addresses significant challenges in time series segmentation, proving to be effective for hierarchical and dynamically evolving scenarios across various applications.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

*Xue Zhou,Dapeng Man,Chen Xu,Fanyi Zeng,Tao Liu,Huan Wang,Shucheng He,Chaoyang Gao,Wu Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel attack on offline RL systems by analyzing coverage issues and lowering performance through data poisoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the security risks in offline RL systems stemming from insufficient data-policy coverage, an area overlooked in prior studies.

Method: Introduced a sequence-level concentrability coefficient for coverage analysis, developed a poisoning attack (CSDPC), and identified rare decision patterns to worsen coverage.

Result: Experimental results show that poisoning 1% of the dataset can reduce agent performance by 90%, demonstrating the severe vulnerability in offline RL systems.

Conclusion: The paper highlights significant security risks in offline RL, emphasizing the need for better coverage safeguards and robust methods to mitigate poisoning vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

*Hellockston Gomes de Brito,Carla Wilza Souza de Paula Maitelli,Osvaldo Chiavone-Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning algorithms to address flow assurance problems, focusing on gas hydrate formation. Decision trees achieved 99.99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oil and gas extraction faces operational challenges like pipeline blockages due to hydrate formation and other factors.

Method: Supervised machine learning techniques (decision trees, k-NN, Naive Bayes) were applied on preprocessed data using scikit-learn to classify hydrate formation cases.

Result: Decision tree algorithm achieved a predictive accuracy of 99.99% in identifying hydrate formation conditions.

Conclusion: Machine learning offers a reliable solution to flow assurance challenges in oil production, optimizing operational efficiency.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model

### [261] [A Causal Lens for Learning Long-term Fair Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11242)
*Jacob Lear,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in reinforcement learning by proposing a framework that evaluates long-term fairness and develops a method to balance fairness concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of existing studies that focus on immediate bias in static contexts and neglect long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems.

Method: A general framework is developed to measure long-term fairness through expected qualification gain, decomposed into direct, delayed, and spurious effects using a causal lens.

Result: Intrinsic connections between fairness components and benefit fairness are analyzed, and a practical approach to balance these fairness notions is introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a new perspective on achieving fairness by regulating equity in dynamic decision-making systems.

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

*Ozan Baris Mulayim,Pengrui Quan,Liying Han,Xiaomin Ouyang,Dezhi Hong,Mario Bergés,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study assesses Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for building energy management (BEM), highlighting their limited generalizability compared to statistical models and need for significant design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether TSFMs can achieve generalizability across diverse tasks and datasets in BEM, in a similar manner to LLMs, and address scalability challenges.

Method: The study evaluates TSFMs along four dimensions: zero-shot univariate forecasting, forecasting with covariates, zero-shot representation learning for classification, and robustness to metrics and conditions.

Result: TSFMs show limited generalizability, marginally outperforming statistical models in certain contexts, struggling with covariates and complex environments, and displaying sensitivity to evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TSFMs require targeted design improvements, especially in handling covariates, context, and temporal dynamics, to be more effective for scalable BEM tasks.

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

*Milad Hoseinpour,Vladimir Dvorkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a guided diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity data while satisfying domain-specific constraints, tested in power systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing demand for synthetic data due to privacy, security, and legal concerns, especially in domains like healthcare, finance, and power systems. Generative models can address these needs, but they require domain-specific knowledge integration.

Method: The paper proposes a guided diffusion model that incorporates domain constraints directly into the data generation process. For power systems, it ensures validity by applying gradient-based guidance to steer sampling toward feasible solutions.

Result: The approach successfully synthesizes statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets while adhering to domain constraints like Kirchhoff laws.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates its ability to integrate domain knowledge during data generation, providing an effective way to create synthetic data for power systems and potentially other fields involving tabular data.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Karen Medlin,Sven Leyffer,Krishnan Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in classification tasks and introduces MOODS, a bilevel optimization framework, alongside a metric to evaluate sampling methods, achieving up to 15% improvement in F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance between majority and minority data points in classification problems often leads to poor minority class performance, which traditional methods fail to address effectively.

Method: The paper introduces MOODS, a bilevel optimization framework for synthetic oversampling and majority undersampling, and proposes a new metric, '$\epsilon/\delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric,' to validate sampling quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with improved diversity, leading to a 1-15% increase in F1 scores.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and metric successfully improve sampling strategies and enhance minority class classification performance.

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

TL;DR: The study introduces an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO) to address challenges in learning evolving physical processes and making spatio-temporal predictions under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning struggles to generalize across varying spatio-temporal environments and lacks physical interpretability, creating difficulties for applications such as additive manufacturing.

Method: The paper introduces ASNO, an architecture using separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions while incorporating elements inspired by the backward differentiation formula (BDF) to predict and adapt to unseen physical parameters.

Result: ASNO outperformed existing models on scientific machine learning benchmarks and showed enhanced capability in ensuring interpretability and generalizability across unseen physical environments.

Conclusion: ASNO bridges the gap between traditional machine learning performance and physical interpretability, proving effective for engineering, physics discovery, and interpretable SciML applications.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

TL;DR: The paper investigates sample complexity in stochastic convex optimization with unknown parameters and introduces two methods: model selection for learning rates and regularization for distance to optimality, showing adaptability and mitigating overfitting risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to address the challenges of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization, particularly when parameters like distance to optimality are unknown, while ensuring methods generalize without overfitting.

Method: The paper employs two main strategies: (1) a log-log efficient model selection method for tuning learning rates without overfitting and (2) a regularization-based approach focused on adapting to the unknown distance to optimality.

Result: The methods achieve optimal sample complexity under unknown problem parameters and successfully separate the computational and sample complexity measures in convex optimization. Additionally, experiments on tasks like CIFAR-10 fine-tuning and Gemini prompt engineering indicate success in reducing overfitting on small validation sets.

Conclusion: The combined strategies enable adaptability to multiple unknown problem structures, offering practical benefits for parameter-free optimization and improving generalization in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

Motivation: Deep neural networks often generalize poorly due to reliance on spurious correlations, which undermines robustness and trustworthiness in diverse scenarios.

Method: The study introduces Evidential Alignment, combining uncertainty quantification with evidential calibration to suppress spurious correlations and preserve core features, eliminating the need for external annotations or deterministic models.

Result: The framework successfully suppresses spurious correlations and enhances group robustness across varied architectures and data modalities.

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment is an effective, scalable solution to debias deep neural networks, improving reliability without requiring costly external annotations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

### [268] [EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11368)
*Pintu Kumar,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) for graph data, presenting 3 EDN variants that account for node degrees and their effects on label noise, showing its impact on Graph Neural Network performance and existing noise-robust algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional Noise (CCN) do not consider graph topology, specifically the influence of edge relationships, making them less applicable to real-world graph data.

Method: The authors propose Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) models in 3 variants, studying how node degree affects label corruption probability, and conduct experiments on graph datasets using 5 GNN architectures and 8 noise-robust algorithms.

Result: Two EDN variants significantly degrade performance in GNNs and noise-robust algorithms compared to traditional noise models. Statistical hypothesis testing validates these effects.

Conclusion: Incorporating EDN models is critical for evaluating and improving noise-robust algorithms in graph-based machine learning, especially in noisy environments.

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

### [269] [The Effect of Stochasticity in Score-Based Diffusion Sampling: a KL Divergence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11378)
*Bernardo P. Schaeffer,Ricardo M. S. Rosa,Glauco Valle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of stochasticity during sampling in score-based diffusion models and its effect on Kullback-Leibler divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochasticity influences the performance of sampling in score-based diffusion models, particularly its role in error correction and amplification.

Method: Theoretical bounds are derived using log-Sobolev inequalities and supported by numerical and analytical examples to quantify KL divergence and stochasticity's effects under different settings.

Result: Stochasticity can act as an error-correcting mechanism when score functions are exact, but introduces trade-offs between error correction and amplification when score functions are approximate.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights into the dual roles of stochasticity during sampling, providing theoretical and empirical tools to balance correction and amplification for improved performance.

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

*Riddhiman Raut,Romit Maulik,Shivam Barwey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN) to improve interpretability in graph neural networks, particularly for scientific models on unstructured grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs lack interpretability, especially when predicting multiple variables, as they do not adequately capture individual feature influence in multivariate tasks.

Method: FIGNN employs a feature-specific pooling strategy for individual spatial attributions and uses a mask-based regularization term to align interpretability with prediction accuracy.

Result: When tested on the SPEEDY atmospheric model and the BFS fluid dynamics benchmark, FIGNN showed comparable predictive performance and revealed feature-specific spatial patterns.

Conclusion: FIGNN demonstrates potential as a versatile framework for interpretable and accurate surrogate modeling in scientific domains.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

### [271] [LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11402)
*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a critical vulnerability in parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (PEFT) like LoRA for LLMs, where models become susceptible to reliance on spurious tokens that can bias decision-making, enabling manipulation through Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore potential catastrophic failures in popular Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which have prioritized efficiency but overlooked vulnerabilities in their alignment with downstream tasks.

Method: The authors inject small, correlated spurious tokens into training datasets and evaluate their influence on various pre-trained models and datasets, measuring the susceptibility of models fine-tuned with LoRA to this manipulation.

Result: They identify that even a single token can disproportionately influence a model's decision-making, with reliance linked to the LoRA rank. Additionally, larger LoRA ranks can mitigate some reliance when exposed to aggressive spurious injections.

Conclusion: While PEFT methods like LoRA are resource-efficient, they are highly susceptible to manipulation through token injections, posing risks for both accidental and intentional abuse. Understanding and mitigating this flaw is crucial for the robust deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

### [272] [Byzantine Outside, Curious Inside: Reconstructing Data Through Malicious Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11413)
*Kai Yue,Richeng Jin,Chau-Wai Wong,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel threat model for Federated Learning (FL) called the maliciously curious client, capable of compromising privacy by reconstructing private data using manipulated gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to highlight a critical privacy concern in FL where clients might maliciously manipulate gradients to infer private data from others, bypassing existing defense mechanisms.

Method: They formalize the client-side threat model theoretically and propose a reconstruction algorithm combining gradient inversion with malicious update strategies, complemented by theoretical and experimental analysis.

Result: Their findings show that current FL defenses, both server-side aggregation and client-side privacy mechanisms, fail to protect against this attack, and some may even unintentionally increase data leakage.

Conclusion: FL protocols need to address the blind spot in their defenses since inadvertently flawed strategies may amplify privacy risks rather than mitigate them.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

### [273] [Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11415)
*Linlin Wang,Tianqing Zhu,Laiqiao Qin,Longxiang Gao,Wanlei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework to highlight how poisoning attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems amplify biases in language models, and proposes a dual-stage defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked impact of poisoning attacks in RAG systems on amplifying bias in large language models.

Method: The authors design adversarial document generation leveraging multi-objective rewards, use subspace projection techniques for biased retrieval manipulation, and construct a cyclic feedback for continuous bias amplification.

Result: Experiments validate that BRRA attacks significantly increase model biases in multiple dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that RAG system security directly affects model fairness, and calls attention to fairness concerns in RAG systems.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

*Zhenqiao Song,Tiaoxiao Li,Lei Li,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPDiff, a new diffusion model, is introduced to efficiently design high-affinity protein binders for arbitrary protein targets. It surpasses existing methods in generating protein binders by pretraining on a comprehensive dataset and fine-tuning for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of high-affinity protein binders without the need for extensive lab testing is a significant challenge in biomedical research. Despite progress in targeting specific proteins, current methods lack the ability to generalize for arbitrary targets effectively.

Method: PPDiff combines a diffusion modeling approach with a specifically designed Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal (SSINC) attention layers. This network models both global amino acid correlations and local 3D interactions using self-attention, k-nearest neighbor graph layers, and causal attention layers. It is pretrained on the curated PPBench dataset and fine-tuned for specific applications.

Result: PPDiff achieves superior success rates during both pretraining and downstream applications, such as target-protein mini-binder complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. Specific success rates achieved were 50.00% for pretraining and 23.16% and 16.89% for the respective downstream applications.

Conclusion: PPDiff demonstrates its capability to generate high-affinity protein binders efficiently, outperforming existing approaches in both pretraining and real-world application tests. This positions the model as a significant advancement in protein engineering.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,
respectively.

*Jinhee Kim,Seoyeon Yoon,Taeho Lee,Joo Chan Lee,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TruncQuant proposes a flexible training scheme to enhance robustness in deep neural networks towards truncation errors for diverse quantization settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient deployment of neural networks on edge devices while maintaining accuracy despite errors introduced by truncation.

Method: TruncQuant aligns training schemes with truncation outputs, utilizing bit-shifting to adapt models for flexible bit precision.

Result: TruncQuant exhibits strong robustness across various bit-width settings and integrates seamlessly with current quantization-aware frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed training scheme improves model adaptability, efficiency, and implementation simplicity in diverse hardware environments.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

*Abhishek Tyagi,Arjun Iyer,William H Renninger,Christopher Kanan,Yuhao Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynaDiag, a hardware-friendly method for training sparse neural networks using a structured diagonal sparsity pattern, achieving comparable performance to unstructured sparsity with improved computational speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) achieve high performance with reduced parameters, but unstructured sparsity struggles to translate into practical speedups on modern hardware.

Method: The proposed method, DynaDiag, uses a structured diagonal sparsity pattern during training, maintains sparse computations in forward and backward passes, and utilizes a custom CUDA kernel for hardware optimization.

Result: DynaDiag achieves accuracy comparable to unstructured sparsity while providing up to a 3.13x speedup in online inference and a 1.59x speedup in training for ViTs with 90% sparse layers on a GPU.

Conclusion: DynaDiag offers a high-performing, structured sparse-to-sparse training solution that is computationally efficient and hardware-friendly, making it a valuable approach for scaling sparse neural networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

*Haotian Ni,Yake Wei,Hang Liu,Gong Chen,Chong Peng,Hao Lin,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation in self-attention models for multimodal learning, where they tend to over-rely on a single modality, reducing dynamic adaptability. It introduces a new method, Rolling Query (RollingQ), to counteract this issue by balancing attention allocation, and validates its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that multimodal self-attention models lose dynamic adaptability by overemphasizing one modality, leading to reduced fusion effectiveness.

Method: Rolling Query (RollingQ) was developed, which balances attention allocation by rotating the query to prevent the self-reinforcing cycle and reduce key distribution gaps between modalities.

Result: RollingQ improved the adaptability and effectiveness of multimodal Transformers, demonstrated through a range of experiments across various multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: By reviving cooperation dynamics among modalities, RollingQ enhances the capability of multimodal Transformers for more balanced and effective learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source

TL;DR: LearnAlign is proposed to optimize LLM reinforcement learning post-training by selecting highly effective reasoning data, significantly reducing data demands without notable performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for improving large language models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities, but suffers from data inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose LearnAlign, a gradient-alignment-based method that uses data learnability via success rate to select representative training data while avoiding response-length bias in gradient norms.

Result: LearnAlign achieves major data savings, reducing data needs by up to 1,000 points on GSM8K, while maintaining or improving performance (e.g., 77.53% vs 77.04% on GSM8K).

Conclusion: LearnAlign demonstrates effective data-efficient RL post-training, paving the way for future improvements in reasoning data optimization. The authors commit to sharing code to encourage further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

Motivation: The motivation is the rising global threat of diabetes and the need for early detection and management using tools like machine learning for preventive healthcare.

Method: The study tested statistical and non-statistical machine learning techniques—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks—on 768 samples from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The evaluation focused on accuracy and effectiveness in predicting diabetes risk.

Result: The best-performing algorithm was Neural Networks with 78.57% accuracy, followed by Random Forest at 76.30% accuracy, illustrating the potential of these machine learning models.

Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms, particularly Neural Networks, are effective tools for predicting diabetes risk and could serve as early screening mechanisms, aiding in timely healthcare interventions and reducing the diabetes burden on healthcare systems.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to

years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting
diabetes risk and are beneficial for practitioners. Objective: This study
highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical
machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The
results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive
accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second
position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning
techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act
as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health

Result: The models accurately classified VUR severity with no false positives or negatives, showing sensitivity to subtle image patterns and high AUC values.

Conclusion: Machine learning provides a promising alternative for objective VUR grading, focusing on renal calyceal deformation as a predictor of severe VUR. Future work should aim to expand datasets and refine models.

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

### [282] [Task-Driven Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11511)
*Tung-Long Vuong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates deep discrete representation learning (DRL) from a task-driven perspective, proposing a unified framework to evaluate its usefulness and exploring its implications for various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most DRL frameworks evaluate representation indirectly through generation quality, leaving the definition of 'goodness' ambiguous.

Method: The authors propose a task-driven unified framework and conduct a theoretical analysis on the trade-off between discrete representation capacity and sample complexity.

Result: The framework demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness across a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Task-driven evaluations and theoretical insights improve understanding of discrete representation usage and its impact on performance.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

### [283] [Prioritizing Alignment Paradigms over Task-Specific Model Customization in Time-Series LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11512)
*Wei Li,Yunyao Cheng,Xinli Hao,Chaohong Ma,Yuxuan Liang,Bin Yang,Christian S. Jensen,Xiaofeng Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates shifting focus from task-specific model customization to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with intrinsic time-series data structures using three paradigms for efficient, flexible reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time-series reasoning approaches in LLMs often rely on task-specific model customization, which can be costly, inflexible, and inefficient, overlooking the intrinsic primitives of time-series data.

Method: The authors propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment (domain-focused), Bridging Alignment (characteristic-focused), and Internal Alignment (representation-focused) to prioritize the intrinsic properties of time-series data for reasoning tasks.

Result: The paper categorizes literature into the proposed alignment paradigms, outlines applicable alignment-oriented methods, and proposes promising research directions to activate economical and efficient reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Conclusion: Shifting to alignment paradigms centered on time-series primitives offers a viable path toward more economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning with LLMs, circumventing the limitations of current task-specific approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

*Chengye Li,Haiyun Liu,Yuanxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new theoretical perspective on in-context learning (ICL), interpreting it as an implicit knowledge distillation process, and provides a generalization bound using Rademacher complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models, which lacks theoretical clarity despite its success.

Method: The study interprets ICL as implicit knowledge distillation during inference using prompt demonstrations, derives a generalization bound using Rademacher complexity, and measures bias based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between distributions.

Result: The framework explains various empirical phenomena, unifies prior gradient-based and distributional analyses, and provides theoretical groundwork for future prompt engineering and demonstration selection.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretation of ICL as a distillation process during inference introduces a foundational perspective that enhances understanding, fosters improvement, and supports reliable application of ICL in LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

*Zijian Wang,Peng Tao,Luonan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delayformer framework predicts time-series dynamics in high-dimensional systems by overcoming challenges of nonlinearity and variable interactions using novel spatiotemporal embeddings and Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting high-dimensional time-series dynamics is essential but challenging due to nonlinearity, complex variable interactions, limited and noisy data.

Method: Delayformer employs delay-embedded states for multivariate spatiotemporal transformation and uses a Visual Transformer encoder for cross-representation, combined with linear decoders for parallel state predictions.

Result: Delayformer achieves superior performance in forecasting tasks on synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Delayformer offers a robust, theoretically grounded approach that can serve as a foundational time-series model, with broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

*Aamir Hussain Chughtai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The thesis develops robust nonlinear filtering techniques to handle real-world sensor data challenges like outliers and missing observations, with extensions to smoothing, simulations, and applications in diverse fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional filtering methods struggle with real-world noise abnormalities like outliers, biases, or missing data since they rely on known noise statistics, which are often unavailable or inaccurate.

Method: The thesis leverages Bayesian inference frameworks and employs methods such as Variational Inference, Particle Filters, and Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds. It also extends these approaches to offline learning and smoothing.

Result: The proposed methods improved performance in applications like target tracking, localization, and 3D registration through simulations and experiments, showcasing their robustness to noise abnormalities.

Conclusion: The presented methods enhance robustness in state estimation and offer insights for applications in machine learning, system dynamics, and generative AI, tackling challenges like outliers and dataset imbalances.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

### [287] [Improving Multimodal Learning Balance and Sufficiency through Data Remixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11550)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen,Yongjian Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses modality imbalances in multimodal models by proposing Data Remixing, a novel approach that decouples and reassembles multimodal data to enhance balance and sufficiency in learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning techniques struggle with modality imbalance, where optimization speeds and paths differ across modalities, causing inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduce Data Remixing, which involves decoupling data for individual modalities, filtering difficult samples, and reassembling batches to align gradient directions for better learning balance.

Result: Experiments using Data Remixing showed significant performance improvements: 6.50% accuracy increase on CREMAD and 3.41% on Kinetic-Sounds, with no extra computational costs at inference.

Conclusion: Data Remixing effectively enhances both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance, making it a valuable addition to multimodal learning methods.

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

*Zhiwei Li,Guodong Long,Chunxu Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Jing Jiang,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) for enhanced personalization and generalization in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of balancing generalized learning with personalized adaptation in foundation models.

Method: The paper proposes FFMs, which use decentralized processes to separate shared knowledge from individual adaptations, particularly showcased in recommendation systems.

Result: FFMs promise to effectively integrate user-specific feedback while maintaining generalization, enabling personalized adaptive systems.

Conclusion: FFMs offer a decentralized and user-centric framework that empowers individuals to retain control over their own personalized content-guiding agents.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

### [289] [A Comparative Analysis of Influence Signals for Data Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11584)
*Nikolaos Myrtakis,Ioannis Tsamardinos,Vassilis Christophides*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates influence-based signals for detecting mislabeled and anomalous training samples to improve ML model quality, finding that while some signals like Self-Influence are effective for mislabeled data, none are reliable for anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the reliability and performance of ML models by enhancing the quality of training samples, particularly identifying mislabeled or anomalous data without relying on extra glitch detectors.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative analysis of influence-based signals (like Self-Influence and Average Absolute Influence) under a unified influence estimator (TraceIn) across different data modalities (image and tabular) and deep learning models.

Result: The paper concludes that Self-Influence is useful for detecting mislabeled training samples, but none of the explored signals can reliably identify anomalous samples due to issues like influence cancellation and a lack of training dynamics consideration.

Conclusion: Influence-based signals can partially improve training data quality but require advancements to address anomalies and fully leverage training dynamics to avoid misleading influences.

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

*Yaning Jia,Shenyang Deng,Chiyu Ma,Yaoqing Yang,Soroush Vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KCES, a defense framework against adversarial attacks on GNNs using a novel metric called Graph Kernel Complexity to identify and remove harmful edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are highly vulnerable to small perturbations and adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods often rely on heuristics, overfit to specific attacks, and are computationally expensive.

Method: The authors propose KCES, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that uses Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC) to assess the importance of edges in a graph and remove high-risk edges to improve network robustness.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show that KCES consistently outperforms existing defenses, enhances GNN robustness, and can amplify the effectiveness of other defense strategies.

Conclusion: KCES provides an efficient, principled solution for improving GNN robustness and can be integrated with other defenses as a plug-and-play module without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

*Edward Turner,Anna Soligo,Mia Taylor,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores 'Emergent Misalignment (EM)', where fine-tuning language models on narrow datasets leads to broader misalignment issues, presenting mechanisms, tools, and clean model organisms to advance understanding and mitigate alignment risks in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the unexpected discovery of Emergent Misalignment (EM) when fine-tuning LLMs, exposing significant knowledge gaps in model alignment and the need to ensure AI safety.

Method: The authors used narrowly misaligned datasets to create improved 'model organisms' with 99% coherence, functional on smaller models (0.5B parameters), and induced misalignment via a single rank-1 LoRA adapter. Experiments spanned diverse model sizes, families, and training protocols.

Result: They identified EM occurring robustly across various conditions and isolated a mechanistic phase transition tied to a behavioral phase transition, offering insights into instances where alignment breaks down.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the challenges in achieving robust alignment in LLMs. The work contributes cleaner model organisms as a foundation for understanding and addressing alignment risks, paving the way for enhanced safety in LLM applications.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

*Deliang Jin,Gang Chen,Shuo Feng,Yufeng Ling,Haoran Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework inspired by machine unlearning to address noisy training data in deep neural networks, improving accuracy and efficiency without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling noisy or corrupted training data effectively in deep neural networks without relying on restrictive assumptions or extensive retraining.

Method: Integrates attribution-guided data partitioning, neuron pruning, and fine-tuning. It identifies high-quality data using gradient-based attribution and prunes noise-sensitive neurons with regression-based analysis.

Result: Improved accuracy by approximately 10% on CIFAR-10 with label noise, and reduced retraining time by up to 47%, showing robustness across tasks and noise levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances generalization performance in noisy environments while offering practical advantages in efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can lead to emergent misalignment, which extends beyond the training domain. This paper investigates mechanisms using minimal rank-1 adapter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent misalignment in large language models poses challenges because its mechanisms and generalization beyond training datasets remain unclear, hindering model alignment understanding.

Method: The authors study misalignment using minimal model organisms (rank-1 adapters) applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, analyze convergence in misaligned representations, extract 'misalignment directions,' and interpret adapter contributions experimentally.

Result: Finds consistent misalignment representations across models, develops methods to remove misaligned behavior using extracted directions, and identifies specific adapter roles in localized and general misalignment.

Conclusion: This work enhances understanding of emergent misalignment mechanisms. Insights could help mitigate undesirable behaviors in language models, advancing broader alignment efforts.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

*Daniel James Pitchforth,Matthew Rhys Jones,Samuel John Gibson,Elizabeth Jane Cross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel kernels for Gaussian processes that dynamically adjust the reliance on physical knowledge, optimizing physics-data balance in modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical challenge of achieving an optimal balance between physics-based and data-driven approaches in machine learning models, especially when physical models have limitations or uncertainties.

Method: The authors develop physically-informed change-point kernels for Gaussian processes that enable dynamic variation of reliance on physical knowledge. These kernels allow users to define conditions for incorporating physics-based models or automatically learn them through interpretable structures.

Result: The proposed approach is tested using two engineering case studies: modeling wind loading on a cable-stayed bridge and predicting aircraft wing strain during flight. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the kernels in dynamically adjusting physics-data balance.

Conclusion: The developed kernels provide improved modeling flexibility, uncertainty representation, and interpretability, optimizing the integration of physical knowledge and data in various application scenarios.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

*Katharina Limbeck,Lydia Mezrag,Guy Wolf,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel graph pooling layers for graph neural networks (GNNs) that preserve graph structure and improve generalization across diverse tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph pooling operations often sacrifice fundamental graph structures and interpretability, leading to unreliable performance across datasets and tasks.

Method: The proposed method employs edge collapses based on diffusion geometry to iteratively reduce graph size while preserving metric structure and diversity, using isometry-invariant measures and efficient computational techniques.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed pooling methods outperform existing alternatives in graph classification tasks, maintain key spectral properties, and achieve consistent high accuracy across different pooling ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware graph pooling layers provide better performance, interpretability, and stability, addressing limitations of prior pooling approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

*Lukas Fehring,Marius Lindauer,Theresa Eimer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrowNN introduces an approach for progressively growing neural networks during training to enable more complex policy learning in Reinforcement Learning, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mid-sized or large network training in Reinforcement Learning remains challenging, limiting the complexity of policies that can be learned.

Method: GrowNN progressively adds layers to a network during training, starting with a small model and adding layers while maintaining the encoded function to enable more expressive policies.

Result: Experiments show that GrowNN improves performance significantly over static networks of the same size, with reported gains of up to 48% (MiniHack Room) and 72% (Ant).

Conclusion: Progressive network growth with GrowNN enhances network trainability and performance, enabling more complex policies in Reinforcement Learning.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

*Markus Gambietz,Eva Dorschky,Altan Akat,Marcel Schöckel,Jörg Miehling,Anne D. Koelewijn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces SSPINNpose, a self-supervised neural network leveraging IMU data to accurately estimate joint kinematics and kinetics without needing ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for biomechanical analysis rely on supervised learning with laboratory systems, which are error-prone and lack real-world generalizability.

Method: SSPINNpose employs a self-supervised approach using IMU data, optimizing physical plausibility through a human body physics model to generate virtual sensor data for training.

Result: The system achieves RMSD of 8.7 degrees for joint angles and 4.9 BWBH% for joint moments during walking and running, showcasing robustness in sparse sensor settings.

Conclusion: SSPINNpose offers an adaptable, scalable solution for real-time biomechanical analysis, making it suitable for both laboratory and field applications.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

### [298] [Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790)
*Gregor Baer,Isel Grau,Chao Zhang,Pieter Van Gorp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates class-dependent evaluation effects in feature attribution methods for explainable AI, revealing discrepancies in performance of different evaluation metrics and calling for careful interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of perturbation-based evaluation metrics for feature attribution methods in XAI, especially when ground truth data is absent.

Method: Conduct controlled experiments with synthetic time series data, systematically varying feature types and class contrasts, and comparing perturbation-based metrics with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics across multiple attribution methods.

Result: The study identifies class-dependent effects in attribution evaluation triggered by variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent and finds weak correlations between perturbation-based and ground truth-based metrics.

Conclusion: Perturbation metrics may not reliably measure attribution quality, demanding careful scrutiny and the development of more comprehensive evaluation frameworks for investigating attribution quality.

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

*Hwiwon Lee,Ziqi Zhang,Hanxiao Lu,Lingming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEC-bench, an automated benchmark for evaluating large language model agents on real-world security tasks, revealing significant gaps in current system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks use synthetic or simplified datasets, falling short in capturing the real-world complexities faced by security engineers. A robust evaluation framework is needed to establish trust in deploying LLMs for security tasks.

Method: The authors developed SEC-bench, a fully automated framework that constructs code repositories, reproduces vulnerabilities, and generates evaluation metrics. Two tasks—PoC generation and vulnerability patching—were implemented for testing.

Result: State-of-the-art LLM agents achieved low success rates: 18.0% for proof-of-concept generation and 34.0% for vulnerability patching, highlighting existing limitations.

Conclusion: SEC-bench identifies critical performance gaps in current LLMs and provides a way forward for creating more intelligent and practical agents for security engineering.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

*Qihai Zhang,Xinyue Sheng,Yuanfu Sun,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrustGLM evaluates vulnerabilities in GraphLLMs against adversarial attacks across text, graph structure, and prompts, finding them highly susceptible and proposing defense techniques to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to assess the robustness of GraphLLMs, a new category of graph-learning models leveraging LLMs, against adversarial attacks, especially given their potential use in critical scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce TrustGLM, which evaluates the resilience of GraphLLMs using state-of-the-art adversarial attack algorithms on three dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations, across six benchmark datasets. Defense techniques like data augmentation and adversarial training are also explored.

Result: GraphLLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial text attacks, graph structure manipulations, and prompt modifications, causing significant performance degradation in various settings.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerabilities of GraphLLMs and demonstrates the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, calling for more research and providing open-source resources for further exploration.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

*R. Teal Witter,Yurong Liu,Christopher Musco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method combining Monte Carlo sampling with flexible function families, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating probabilistic values like Shapley values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate estimation of probabilistic values, vital for explainable AI tasks, motivated the study as current methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The authors propose combining Monte Carlo sampling with versatile function families (e.g., tree-based models like XGBoost), enabling unbiased estimates and enhanced accuracy.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show significantly lower errors in estimating probabilistic values, surpassing methods like Permutation SHAP, Kernel SHAP, and Leverage SHAP.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible and superior estimation framework for probabilistic values, setting a new benchmark for accuracy in Shapley value computation and other tasks.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

*Jina Kim,Jeffrey Willette,Bruno Andreis,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a meta-learning-based approach to address limitations in molecular prediction models, achieving improved generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome poor generalization of molecular prediction models to out-of-distribution compounds in drug discovery due to covariate shifts and limited labeled data.

Method: A novel meta-learning technique utilizing unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data for generalized predictions.

Result: Significant performance improvements observed over state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with covariate shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses generalization issues and enables better predictive accuracy in drug discovery scenarios.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diverse service demands of vehicular networks, especially in meeting QoS satisfaction for eMBB and URLLC.

Method: The authors use Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning integrated with Shapley values and an attention mechanism for intelligent decision-making and interpretability.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate enhanced QoS satisfaction (78.0% to 80.13% for URLLC and 71.44% to 73.21% for eMBB) and improved interpretability precision.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully improves resource allocation interpretability and QoS satisfaction in dynamic vehicular networks.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular
networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By
integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an
attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our
reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in
vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our
approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation
process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention
mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC
services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved
from 71.44% to 73.21%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of input selectivity in Mamba, a type of State-Space Model, revealing its ability to represent discontinuous functions, counter memory decay, and handle associative recall tasks analytically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how input selectivity in Mamba enhances its performance and how it interacts with other architectural elements in the model.

Method: The study proves Mamba's S6 layer can approximate Haar wavelet projections, examines its effect on long-term memory, and provides analytical solutions to associative recall tasks using various Mamba architectures.

Result: The S6 layer's functionality was shown to give Mamba an edge in approximating discontinuous functions, preventing memory decay, and solving recall tasks. Results were validated empirically.

Conclusion: Mamba's design advantages are better understood, and the research outlines opportunities for further improvement based on the findings.

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the success of transformers in diverse applications and their vulnerability to adversarial attacks in modulation classification, the study aims to propose a defense system optimizing efficiency and robustness.

Method: The paper introduces a compact transformer for modulation classification, leveraging adversarial attention map transfer from large transformers trained robustly against adversarial attacks.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques under white-box attack scenarios, including fast gradient and projected gradient descent methods.

Conclusion: The method highlights the importance of transferring adversarial robustness to compact transformers for IoT applications while addressing adversarial transferability issues effectively.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to integrate conflicting signals from prior and measurements in cases involving non-Gaussian or unknown noise.

Method: MAS unifies existing approaches and introduces a more flexible mechanism, leveraging optimization perspectives to balance prior and measurement information effectively.

Result: MAS demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian noise scenarios.

Conclusion: MAS successfully bridges gaps in current frameworks and offers a versatile solution to linear inverse problems with complex noise characteristics.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies have shown deep learning methods' susceptibility to adversarial examples, particularly universal adversarial perturbations, in radio signal classification.

Method: The authors introduce and evaluate a neural rejection system designed to mitigate the impact of universal adversarial perturbations, using white-box perturbations for analysis.

Result: The neural rejection system shows a significantly higher accuracy in defending radio signal classification against universal adversarial perturbations compared to conventional deep neural networks.

Conclusion: Implementing neural rejection systems could serve as a practical solution to improve robustness against universal adversarial perturbations in deep learning-based radio signal classification systems.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

TL;DR: TreeRL integrates tree search into reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) to enhance exploration and reward efficiency, outperforming traditional approaches in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve RL-based reasoning task performance for large language models, addressing challenges like reward hacking and distribution mismatch.

Method: TreeRL employs on-policy tree search, intermediate supervision, and a cost-effective branching strategy based on uncertainty in intermediate steps.

Result: TreeRL showed superior performance on math and code reasoning benchmarks compared to traditional RL approaches like ChainRL.

Conclusion: TreeRL's integration of tree search enhances reasoning capabilities in RL for LLMs, demonstrating practical efficiency and stronger performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in XAS interpretation, which often requires expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and element-specific heuristics, and to create a broader, machine learning-driven framework capable of handling diverse elements and spectral regimes.

Method: A machine learning framework called XAStruct was developed, trained on a large-scale dataset across over 70 elements. It includes separate models for predicting atom neighbor types from spectra and for unified regression of mean nearest-neighbor distances, opting to train these tasks independently for better accuracy.

Result: XAStruct can accurately predict XAS spectra from crystal structures and infer local structural descriptors (e.g., neighbor atom types and mean nearest-neighbor distances) from XAS input, outperforming element-specific heuristic methods.

Conclusion: XAStruct demonstrates generalization across a wide range of chemistries and bonding environments, offering a scalable and extensible approach for data-driven interpretation of XAS with a focus on task-specific performance.

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

### [310] [Breaking Habits: On the Role of the Advantage Function in Learning Causal State Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11912)
*Miguel Suau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies policy confounding in reinforcement learning and shows that using the advantage function can reduce this issue and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents in reinforcement learning often exploit spurious correlations that arise due to policy-influenced observations, obstructing generalization beyond typical trajectories.

Method: The paper analyzes how the advantage function, by re-weighting action values based on states, disrupts spurious correlations and emphasizes causal factors.

Result: The use of advantage functions is shown to improve performance in scenarios outside of usual trajectories, both analytically and empirically.

Conclusion: The advantage function not only stabilizes gradient estimates but also serves as a mechanism to address policy confounding, leading to better generalization in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with

*Dibya Ghosh,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach to pre-train image representations by framing the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, leveraging the analogy between RL's value-based learning and self-supervised image feature learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of learning high-quality image representations efficiently from unlabeled data, leveraging similarities between RL algorithms and self-supervised feature learning methods.

Method: The proposed method involves modeling image pre-training as an RL problem, where a general value function is learned in a dynamical system. An agent modifies views or applies augmentations to train the system, akin to RL reward shaping.

Result: Experiments show the approach yields improved image feature representations when trained on diverse datasets, including video (EpicKitchens), scenes (COCO), and web-crawled images (CC12M).

Conclusion: By casting self-supervised image pre-training as RL, the method offers a flexible and effective framework for improving features from unlabeled and weakly labeled data, demonstrating robustness across different datasets.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

*Ankit Bhardwaj,Rohail Asim,Sachin Chauhan,Yasir Zaki,Lakshminarayanan Subramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based control protocol for self-regulating car speed, reducing congestion without additional physical infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic control mechanisms fail in high-speed, signal-free road environments, necessitating smarter congestion management solutions.

Method: Combines traffic flow theory, gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a reinforcement learning framework, abstracting roads into super-segments for dynamic vehicular speed modulation.

Result: Method achieves a 5% increase in throughput, 13% reduction in average delay, and 3% decrease in total stops in a high-fidelity simulator, outperforming no-control settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers scalable, smoother, and more efficient traffic management, generalizing across diverse traffic patterns.

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between efficiency and robustness in deploying deep neural networks in safety-critical, resource-constrained environments.

Method: Developed the CACTUS framework, unifying compression and certified robustness using network sets during model training.

Result: CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and certifiable robustness for pruning and quantization across different datasets and inputs.

Conclusion: CACTUS enables efficient model compression while ensuring robustness, effectively balancing safety and efficiency objectives.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained
environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat
compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either
efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training
Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during
training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed.
We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high
accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the storage size of neural network training checkpoints while ensuring near-lossless recovery for storage-limited environments.

Method: The method involves prediction-based compression using arithmetic coding and improving compression performance with pruning and quantization.

Result: The approach achieves significant bit size reduction in stored checkpoints while preserving model performance and enabling near-lossless training recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for checkpoint compression, making it practical for storage-constrained scenarios without compromising training recovery or model performance.

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

*Paul Setinek,Gianluca Galletti,Thomas Gross,Dominik Schnürer,Johannes Brandstetter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of neural surrogates failing to generalize across unseen Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problem configurations by introducing a new dataset, SIMSHIFT, and evaluating domain adaptation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitation of neural surrogates in generalizing to unseen problem configurations in PDEs, such as novel material types or different structural dimensions, which limits their applicability in real-world industrial simulations.

Method: The authors introduce SIMSHIFT, a dataset of four industrial simulation tasks, and apply domain adaptation techniques to neural surrogates by leveraging parametric descriptions and ground truth data from source configurations to predict target configurations without access to their ground truth data.

Result: Experiments showed that domain adaptation can help neural surrogates better handle out-of-distribution challenges, but significant challenges and open problems remain in achieving robust performance under distribution shifts in industrial scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the potential of domain adaptation for enhancing neural surrogate generalization while highlighting the need for further research to overcome challenges in distribution shifts. The techniques and dataset presented can serve as a benchmark in future studies.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMLoC, a memory-efficient fine-tuning framework for large foundation models, enabling domain-specific customization within inference memory limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large foundation models for specific tasks is currently too expensive due to significant memory requirements beyond inference needs.

Method: EMLoC uses an activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to create an emulator, fine-tuning this emulator via LoRA with a compensation algorithm to correct mismatches between the emulator and original model.

Result: Experiments show EMLoC achieves superior performance across datasets and allows fine-tuning a 38B model on a single consumer GPU without requiring quantization.

Conclusion: EMLoC facilitates efficient and affordable model fine-tuning for individual users, enhancing accessibility of domain-specific model adaptations.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scenario-aware control plane tailored for a dynamic segmented bus in neuromorphic architectures, emphasizing reduced control overhead and optimized energy-area efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuromorphic systems face sparse, asynchronous, and localized communication patterns, requiring energy-efficient interconnect solutions that handle bursts of neural activity.

Method: The authors present a design methodology for a streamlined control plane specifically for a segmented ladder bus, evaluated using FPGA implementation and software simulation.

Result: The proposed methodology significantly reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the data plane and maintains scalability to larger network sizes.

Conclusion: The design approach is effective for scaling dynamic segmented bus systems in neuromorphic architectures while optimizing energy and area consumption.

Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that
communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in
these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural
activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high
traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle
high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among
the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained
attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency.
Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is
essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently
with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a
scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim
of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We
evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software
simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design
process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the
data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel RISC-V-based soft vector processor called FeNN for simulating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on FPGAs, achieving high efficiency and outperforming certain mainstream devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for energy-efficient AI systems has drawn attention to Spiking Neural Networks, but mainstream hardware like GPUs and TPUs is poorly adapted for SNN simulation. The authors aim to leverage FPGA suitability for low arithmetic intensity tasks by introducing a specialized solution.

Method: The authors developed FeNN, a programmable RISC-V-based soft vector processor for FPGA platforms. FeNN utilizes stochastic rounding and saturation techniques to optimize numerical precision while minimizing hardware resource usage.

Result: FeNN demonstrated superior simulation speeds compared to an embedded GPU and the Loihi neuromorphic system while maintaining low hardware utilization and high numerical precision.

Conclusion: FeNN is an effective and efficient solution for simulating SNNs, with programmability and integration capabilities across various computing platforms, offering advantages over existing alternatives.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

TL;DR: This paper addresses energy forecasting for smart buildings by proposing hybrid ensemble models, which outperform 15 other machine learning methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance energy efficiency and management in smart buildings by developing reliable and accurate energy demand forecasting methods.

Method: The paper proposes three hybrid ensemble predictive models using Bagging, Stacking, and Voting mechanisms combined with evolutionary hyper-parameters tuning.

Result: The proposed adaptive evolutionary bagging model demonstrated superior accuracy and reduced learning errors, outperforming 15 other machine learning models by significant margins.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the adaptive evolutionary bagging model is highly effective for energy forecasting in smart buildings, offering significant accuracy improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Smart buildings are gaining popularity because they can enhance energy
efficiency, lower costs, improve security, and provide a more comfortable and
convenient environment for building occupants. A considerable portion of the
global energy supply is consumed in the building sector and plays a pivotal
role in future decarbonization pathways. To manage energy consumption and
improve energy efficiency in smart buildings, developing reliable and accurate
energy demand forecasting is crucial and meaningful. However, extending an
effective predictive model for the total energy use of appliances at the
building level is challenging because of temporal oscillations and complex
linear and non-linear patterns. This paper proposes three hybrid ensemble
predictive models, incorporating Bagging, Stacking, and Voting mechanisms
combined with a fast and effective evolutionary hyper-parameters tuner. The
performance of the proposed energy forecasting model was evaluated using a
hybrid dataset comprising meteorological parameters, appliance energy use,
temperature, humidity, and lighting energy consumption from various sections of
a building, collected by 18 sensors located in Stambroek, Mons, Belgium. To
provide a comparative framework and investigate the efficiency of the proposed
predictive model, 15 popular machine learning (ML) models, including two
classic ML models, three NNs, a Decision Tree (DT), a Random Forest (RF), two
Deep Learning (DL) and six Ensemble models, were compared. The prediction
results indicate that the adaptive evolutionary bagging model surpassed other
predictive models in both accuracy and learning error. Notably, it achieved
accuracy gains of 12.6%, 13.7%, 12.9%, 27.04%, and 17.4% compared to Extreme
Gradient Boosting (XGB), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), GBM, LGBM, and Random

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software often uses third-party libraries, making process-level permission management insufficient. A permission system specifically for libraries is needed to enhance security.

Method: The authors adapt concepts from capability systems to create a token-based permission system integrated with Rust's type system, implementing it as a zero-cost abstraction.

Result: PermRust provides access control at the library level in Rust, enabling better security and resource management without runtime performance costs.

Conclusion: PermRust demonstrates the feasibility of a programming language-level permission system, tailored to Rust's ecosystem, as an innovative approach to enhancing software security.

Abstract: Permission systems which restrict access to system resources are a
well-established technology in operating systems, especially for smartphones.
However, as such systems are implemented in the operating system they can at
most manage access on the process-level. Since moderns software often (re)uses
code from third-parties libraries, a permission system for libraries can be
desirable to enhance security. In this short-paper, we adapt concepts from
capability systems building a novel theoretical foundation for permission
system at the level of the programming language. This leads to PermRust, a
token-based permission system for the Rust programming language as a zero cost
abstraction on top of its type-system. With it access to system resources can
be managed per library.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges of autonomous driving in long-tail scenarios, where rare driving situations require robust and adaptive decision-making.

Method: Poutine is trained in two stages: 1) self-supervised pretraining on vision-language-trajectory data using a large-scale dataset; 2) fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a small set of preference-labeled driving frames.

Result: Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12, nearly matching expert ground-truth scores, and the final Poutine model achieves 7.99, winning the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning for achieving robust, generalizable autonomous driving in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for

Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled

fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gondola, a novel vision-language planning model based on large language models (LLMs) for robotic manipulation to improve generalization across various unseen scenarios. Gondola utilizes multi-view images and segmentation masks, outperforming state-of-the-art in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing LLM-based robotic manipulation methodologies, such as the inability to ground plans in visual environments or handle complex object scenarios, by developing a model that generalizes better across tasks, objects, and environments.

Method: The authors propose Gondola, which processes multi-view images, history plans, and outputs interleaved action texts and segmentation masks to guide robotic actions. They utilize a dataset from RLBench simulator, comprising robot grounded planning, multi-view referring expressions, and pseudo-long-horizon tasks.

Result: Gondola achieves state-of-the-art performance in all four generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, excelling in tasks involving novel placements, rigid and articulated objects, as well as long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Gondola demonstrates significant advancements in vision-language robotic manipulation by addressing both grounding and generalization challenges, validating its efficacy with comprehensive benchmark testing.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

*Shijie Fang,Hang Yu,Qidi Fang,Reuben M. Aronson,Elaine S. Short*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper identifies and categorizes systematic errors, called "sidetracks," in non-expert human demonstrations for robot learning, aiming to improve Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-expert demonstrations for LfD tasks often include systematic suboptimal behaviors, which are commonly misinterpreted as random noise. To enhance robot learning, understanding and addressing these behaviors is crucial.

Method: The study involves 40 participants performing long-horizon robot tasks in both physical and simulated environments. Demonstrations were annotated and analyzed to identify and categorize sidetrack behaviors and control patterns.

Result: Four types of sidetracks—Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause—were identified, along with one control pattern. Their frequency, temporal, and spatial distributions demonstrated systematic links to task contexts and interface designs.

Conclusion: To improve LfD algorithms and bridge lab-training with real-world applications, there is a need for models that capture systematic suboptimalities in demonstrations.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

*Christian Brommer,Alessandro Fornasier,Jan Steinbrener,Stephan Weiss*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to automatically identify sensor models using measurement data to improve localization in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization in robotics relies heavily on accurate sensor models, but identifying and calibrating these models is challenging, especially for inexperienced users and modular systems.

Method: The method involves identifying the most suitable sensor model from a catalog, generating calibration states, evaluating sensor reference frames, and introducing health metrics for reliable decision-making.

Result: The identified sensor models facilitate the initialization of state estimation applications, leading to more robust and accurate system integration.

Conclusion: This approach simplifies sensor integration, aids inexperienced users, and enhances modular robotics performance by addressing common challenges in localization setups.

Abstract: We present a method for the unattended gray-box identification of sensor
models commonly used by localization algorithms in the field of robotics. The
objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of
unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor
models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations
and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's
localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome
of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate
reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified
calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference
frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information
is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application,
thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements.
This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source
and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It
will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and
modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during
runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor
modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the
usage and development of localization approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for automating chemical experiments using dual demonstrations by chemists, validated with polymer-synthesis experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of programming robots to perform synchronized movements with experimental jigs in chemical experiments.

Method: A dual-demonstration-based approach where chemists demonstrate both robot motions and jig operations. The system includes jigs, motion-demonstration and jig-control interfaces, and a mobile manipulator.

Result: The method showed high reproducibility and robust task success rates in polymer-synthesis experiments, particularly in critical tasks like pipetting and dilution.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies robot programming for chemists and provides a flexible, efficient system for automating diverse chemical experiments.

Abstract: While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as
executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, it is
challenging to design a program that synchronizes the robot's movements with
the experimental jigs to conduct an experiment. We propose a concept that
enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot
motions and jig operations by chemists in an experimental environment
constructed to be controlled by a robot. To verify this concept, we developed a
chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in
experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a
mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis
experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and
dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the
demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept
not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also
provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of
experimental conditions, contributing significantly to the field of chemical
experiment automation.

### [331] [Control Architecture and Design for a Multi-robotic Visual Servoing System in Automated Manufacturing Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11387)
*Rongfei Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The research focuses on reducing uncertainties in robotic micro-scale manufacturing, proposing a multi-robot control system and an algorithm for optimal camera positioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot technology advancements have limitations in micro-scale manufacturing due to uncertainties like noise, elasticity, and model inaccuracies that human sensory cues naturally overcome.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-robot control system for fastening and unfastening tasks and a novel algorithm to optimize camera location for reducing image noise.

Result: The proposed control system significantly reduces uncertainties in manufacturing processes, and the camera location algorithm minimizes noise for better visual servoing.

Conclusion: A well-designed control system and optimized camera positioning are critical to overcoming uncertainties in automated micro-manufacturing.

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-Loco, a framework combining morphology-agnostic diffusion models and residual policies to generalize locomotion across diverse robots. It improves performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in enabling locomotion policies to generalize across robots with different morphologies, which differ in observation/action dimensions and dynamics.

Method: Multi-Loco integrates a generative diffusion model for morphology-invariant patterns with a reinforcement learning-based residual policy to refine actions. The diffusion model handles diversity, and the residual policy enhances task-specific performance.

Result: Simulation and real-world tests with four-legged robots demonstrate a 10.35% average return improvement compared to standard RL frameworks, with up to 13.57% enhancement in certain locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-Loco improves generalization and robustness in robot locomotion by leveraging cross-embodiment data and combining generative and residual approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Generalizing locomotion policies across diverse legged robots with varying
morphologies is a key challenge due to differences in observation/action
dimensions and system dynamics. In this work, we propose Multi-Loco, a novel
unified framework combining a morphology-agnostic generative diffusion model
with a lightweight residual policy optimized via reinforcement learning (RL).
The diffusion model captures morphology-invariant locomotion patterns from
diverse cross-embodiment datasets, improving generalization and robustness. The
residual policy is shared across all embodiments and refines the actions
generated by the diffusion model, enhancing task-aware performance and
robustness for real-world deployment. We evaluated our method with a rich
library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world experiments.
Compared to a standard RL framework with PPO, our approach -- replacing the
Gaussian policy with a diffusion model and residual term -- achieves a 10.35%
average return improvement, with gains up to 13.57% in wheeled-biped locomotion
tasks. These results highlight the benefits of cross-embodiment data and
composite generative architectures in learning robust, generalized locomotion
skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in traditional scenario generation methods by exploring the capabilities of foundation models for improving the diversity and realism of driving scenarios critical to autonomous vehicle safety.

Method: The authors categorized foundation models such as large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models for focused analysis of their application in driving scenario generation. They also reviewed associated methodologies, datasets, simulation platforms, and evaluation metrics.

Result: The survey provided a unified taxonomy of foundation models, presented insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these models for autonomous driving scenarios, and gathered related resources with supplementary materials for further exploration.

Conclusion: The paper highlights open challenges and future research directions for the adoption of foundation models in autonomous driving while offering a resource repository for ongoing study.

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-cost under-actuated gripper using an LSTM model for force feedback without sensors, with experimental verification of its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a versatile and robust gripper capable of force feedback control using deep learning instead of force sensors, achieving higher cost-efficiency.

Method: Design of a 3-joint finger mechanism for dual grasping modes, precise kinematics and power modeling, and the use of an LSTM model for force-feedback control.

Result: Quantitative experiments confirm the gripper’s ability to handle diverse objects, ensure robustness, stability, and accurate force-feedback control.

Conclusion: The gripper demonstrates high versatility, functionality, and robustness in experimental settings, marking it as a significant advancement in under-actuated gripping solutions.

Abstract: We present a novel under-actuated gripper with two 3-joint fingers, which
realizes force feedback control by the deep learning technique- Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model, without any force sensor. First, a five-linkage mechanism
stacked by double four-linkages is designed as a finger to automatically
achieve the transformation between parallel and enveloping grasping modes. This
enables the creation of a low-cost under-actuated gripper comprising a single
actuator and two 3-phalange fingers. Second, we devise theoretical models of
kinematics and power transmission based on the proposed gripper, accurately
obtaining fingertip positions and contact forces. Through coupling and
decoupling of five-linkage mechanisms, the proposed gripper offers the expected
capabilities of grasping payload/force/stability and objects with large
dimension ranges. Third, to realize the force control, an LSTM model is
proposed to determine the grasping mode for synthesizing force-feedback control
policies that exploit contact sensing after outlining the uncertainty of
currents using a statistical method. Finally, a series of experiments are
implemented to measure quantitative indicators, such as the payload, grasping
force, force sensing, grasping stability and the dimension ranges of objects to
be grasped. Additionally, the grasping performance of the proposed gripper is
verified experimentally to guarantee the high versatility and robustness of the
proposed gripper.

*Ziren Xiao,Ruxin Xiao,Chang Liu,Xinheng Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method for efficient real-time navigation of multiple robots in smart manufacturing, achieving faster solutions compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing robot collaboration in smart manufacturing requires real-time navigation solutions with minimal computational overhead, as current approaches struggle with large maps and practical deployment.

Method: The authors design a lightweight DRL approach with a target-guided reward function, enabling rapid training and convergence to optimal navigation solutions for multiple robots.

Result: The DRL-based solution reduces computation time for navigation decisions to millisecond levels, improving speed up to 100 times compared to enumerated methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL method is an efficient, scalable, and resource-light solution for real-time robot navigation in smart manufacturing, enabling practical deployment on IoT and mobile devices.

Abstract: The collaboration and interaction of multiple robots have become integral
aspects of smart manufacturing. Effective planning and management play a
crucial role in achieving energy savings and minimising overall costs. This
paper addresses the real-time Dynamic Multiple Sources to Single Destination
(DMS-SD) navigation problem, particularly with a material distribution case for
multiple intelligent robots in smart manufacturing. Enumerated solutions, such
as in \cite{xiao2022efficient}, tackle the problem by generating as many
optimal or near-optimal solutions as possible but do not learn patterns from
the previous experience, whereas the method in \cite{xiao2023collaborative}
only uses limited information from the earlier trajectories. Consequently,
these methods may take a considerable amount of time to compute results on
large maps, rendering real-time operations impractical. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to
address the DMS-SD problem. The proposed DRL method can be efficiently trained
and rapidly converges to the optimal solution using the designed target-guided
reward function. A well-trained DRL model significantly reduces the computation
time for the next movement to a millisecond level, which improves the time up
to 100 times in our experiments compared to the enumerated solutions. Moreover,
the trained DRL model can be easily deployed on lightweight devices in smart
manufacturing, such as Internet of Things devices and mobile phones, which only
require limited computational resources.

*Federico Zocco,Monica Malvezzi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of a robotic disassembler controlled via reinforcement learning to address waste management issues in transitioning to a circular economy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the unsolved problem of waste management caused by the linear economy paradigm and to enhance the practice of material circularity.

Method: The authors modeled a thermodynamical material network, integrating robot disassembler compartments controlled with reinforcement learning algorithms while analyzing circularity outcomes ($\lambda$).

Result: The highest circularity ($\lambda = -2.1$) was achieved under specific conditions with smaller materials, while larger assemblies reduced circularity efficiency.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning positively correlates with circularity success based on material quantity and criticality, introducing principles for circular intelligence and robotics (CIRO).

Abstract: The competition over natural reserves of minerals is expected to increase in
part because of the linear-economy paradigm based on take-make-dispose.
Simultaneously, the linear economy considers end-of-use products as waste
rather than as a resource, which results in large volumes of waste whose
management remains an unsolved problem. Since a transition to a circular
economy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the
notion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely,
$\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a
batch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a
robotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL),
and processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of
the robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and
assessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The
highest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1
kg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1
kg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis
highlighted that the impact on $\lambda$ of the performance of an RL controller
has a positive correlation with the quantity and the criticality of the
materials to be disassembled. This work also gives the principles of the
emerging research fields indicated as circular intelligence and robotics
(CIRO). Source code is publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExoStart, a framework for improving robotic hand control using human demonstrations from a wearable exoskeleton and reinforcement learning, achieving success in complex real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend teleoperation advancements from robotic manipulators to robotic hands, leveraging human-level dexterity for broader manipulation skills.

Method: ExoStart leverages human demonstrations using a sensorized wearable exoskeleton, applies a dynamics filter for feasible trajectories, and uses an auto-curriculum reinforcement learning approach to train robust policies.

Result: ExoStart successfully demonstrated dexterous robotic hand skills with a success rate above 50% across various complex tasks, transferring directly to real-world robots.

Conclusion: ExoStart proves to be a scalable and general framework for learning dexterous hand manipulation, bridging human demonstrations and robotic applications effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in teleoperation systems have enabled high-quality data
collection for robotic manipulators, showing impressive results in learning
manipulation at scale. This progress suggests that extending these capabilities
to robotic hands could unlock an even broader range of manipulation skills,
especially if we could achieve the same level of dexterity that human hands
exhibit. However, teleoperating robotic hands is far from a solved problem, as
it presents a significant challenge due to the high degrees of freedom of
robotic hands and the complex dynamics occurring during contact-rich settings.
In this work, we present ExoStart, a general and scalable learning framework
that leverages human dexterity to improve robotic hand control. In particular,
we obtain high-quality data by collecting direct demonstrations without a robot
in the loop using a sensorized low-cost wearable exoskeleton, capturing the
rich behaviors that humans can demonstrate with their own hands. We also
propose a simulation-based dynamics filter that generates dynamically feasible
trajectories from the collected demonstrations and use the generated
trajectories to bootstrap an auto-curriculum reinforcement learning method that
relies only on simple sparse rewards. The ExoStart pipeline is generalizable
and yields robust policies that transfer zero-shot to the real robot. Our
results demonstrate that ExoStart can generate dexterous real-world hand
skills, achieving a success rate above 50% on a wide range of complex tasks
such as opening an AirPods case or inserting and turning a key in a lock. More

TL;DR: RoboPatient, a robotic medical simulator, improves diagnostic training by providing realistic multimodal pain expressions based on haptic and auditory feedback during palpation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misdiagnosis, delayed treatments, and diagnostic errors need to be addressed, especially in rare or complex medical cases. Robotic patients can fill this training gap by providing a controlled educational platform.

Method: The researchers designed the RoboPatient, integrating tactile input with vocal and facial pain responses. They evaluated its effectiveness through a study involving 7680 trials with 20 participants, analyzing perceptual congruence between palpation and auditory feedback.

Result: Findings revealed that pitch and amplitude in pain sounds significantly influence how participants perceive and agree with the robot's pain expressions. Pitch is identified as the key factor.

Conclusion: This research showcases RoboPatient as a promising tool for enhancing clinical education through realistic simulation, with auditory and haptic feedback improving perceived realism and diagnostic training effectiveness.

Abstract: Misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatments and harm. Robotic patients offer
a controlled way to train and evaluate clinicians in rare, subtle, or complex
cases, reducing diagnostic errors. We present RoboPatient, a medical robotic
simulator aimed at multimodal pain synthesis based on haptic and auditory
feedback during palpation-based training scenarios. The robopatient functions
as an adaptive intermediary, capable of synthesizing plausible pain expressions
vocal and facial in response to tactile stimuli generated during palpation.
Using an abdominal phantom, robopatient captures and processes haptic input via
an internal palpation-to-pain mapping model. To evaluate perceptual congruence
between palpation and the corresponding auditory output, we conducted a study
involving 7680 trials across 20 participants, where they evaluated pain
intensity through sound. Results show that amplitude and pitch significantly
influence agreement with the robot's pain expressions, irrespective of pain
sounds. Stronger palpation forces elicited stronger agreement, aligning with
psychophysical patterns. The study revealed two key dimensions: pitch and
amplitude are central to how people perceive pain sounds, with pitch being the
most influential cue. These acoustic features shape how well the sound matches
the applied force during palpation, impacting perceived realism. This approach
lays the groundwork for high-fidelity robotic patients in clinical education
and diagnostic simulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PACE-ADS, a framework enabling autonomous vehicles to interact with occupants by interpreting human psychological and cognitive signals, enhancing personalization and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous vehicles lack effective interaction with passengers, hindering their adaptability, comfort, and broader adoption.

Method: PACE-ADS uses three foundation model-based agents: Driver Agent (traffic context analysis), Psychologist Agent (interprets psychological signals), and Coordinator Agent (integrates inputs for behavior decisions). It operates at a behavioral level without replacing existing AV systems.

Result: Simulations show that PACE-ADS adapts to occupant states, enhances ride comfort, and allows safe recovery from immobilization in diverse driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of PACE-ADS in improving human-centered autonomy, pointing to the potential of LLM-based frameworks for advancing AV-human interaction.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous driving, current autonomous vehicles
(AVs) lack effective bidirectional communication with occupants, limiting
personalization and recovery from immobilization. This reduces comfort and
trust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology
and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy
framework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external
traffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation
model-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a
Psychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG,
heart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a
Coordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior
decisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV
modules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level,
delegating low-level control to native AV systems. This separation enables
closed-loop adaptation and supports integration across diverse platforms. We
evaluate PACE-ADS in simulation across varied scenarios involving traffic
lights, pedestrians, work zones, and car following. Results show that PACE-ADS
adapts driving styles to occupant states, improves ride comfort, and enables
safe recovery from immobilization via autonomous reasoning or human guidance.
Our findings highlight the promise of LLM-based frameworks for bridging the gap
between machine autonomy and human-centered driving.

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based method to generate realistic auditory pain expressions in robopatients during palpation, enhancing medical training simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing diagnostic errors through improved medical training simulators, focusing on generating realistic multimodal feedback during procedural training.

Method: The method uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning approach where a robot adapts pain sounds based on real-time human feedback to match preferences.

Result: The system successfully produces dynamic pain sounds in response to palpation forces, captures varying pain intensities, and accounts for gender-specific thresholds in sound perception.

Conclusion: This system provides a controllable and immersive platform for training in abdominal palpation, improving diagnostics in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in
resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients,
play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for
procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback,
especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex
relationship between palpation behavior and sound. The high-dimensional nature
of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This
study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in
robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in
response to palpation force, by co-optimizing human feedback using machine
learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively
refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes
randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to
adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated
that the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound
preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild
discomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory
pain space. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits
saturation at lower forces with gender specific thresholds. These findings
highlight the system's potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by
offering a controllable and immersive simulation platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel system called SAIL for enabling robotic policies trained via offline Imitation Learning to execute faster-than-demonstration speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the limitation of IL-trained policies being bound to mimic task speed observed in datasets, which constrains throughput critical for applications like industrial automation.

Method: They propose SAIL, a system integrating action inference, motion tracking, adaptive speed modulation, and latency-aware scheduling to overcome challenges in dynamics and distribution shifts.

Result: Experiments across simulation and real robotic platforms demonstrate up to 4x speed improvement in simulated tasks and up to 3.2x in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: SAIL proves effective for robotic systems requiring faster imitation learning execution, thus increasing their applicability in speed-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

*Shaoyi Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates extending the Chain of Draft (CoD) method for software engineering tasks, achieving significant efficiency improvements over Chain of Thought (CoT) without much reduction in code quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of current large language models (LLMs) in handling complex software tasks due to verbose reasoning, leading to high latency and costs.

Method: The study adapted and assessed multiple variants of the CoD method, focusing on software tasks, through experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark.

Result: CoD methods used significantly fewer tokens (e.g., 55.4% compared to CoT's tokens) and maintained over 90% of CoT's code quality across key metrics, achieving improved efficiency while retaining functionality.

Conclusion: CoD variants are practical and efficient alternatives to CoT for LLM-based software development, offering a balance between efficiency and quality, and providing actionable insights for optimizing development workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become vital tools for software
development, but they often require verbose intermediate reasoning for complex
code tasks, leading to high latency and costs. This research extends the Chain
of Draft (CoD) method to software engineering, designing and evaluating
multiple CoD variants tailored for code tasks. Through comprehensive
experiments on all 300 samples from the SWE-bench benchmark, we found that all
CoD variants used significantly fewer tokens than Chain of Thought (CoT), with
Baseline CoD being most efficient at 55.4% of CoT's tokens. While this
represents substantial efficiency gains - translating to approximately 45%
reduction in processing time and API costs - it differs from the extreme 7.6%
reported in the original CoD paper for mathematical reasoning. This difference
stems from the inherent complexity and context-dependency of software tasks,
which require more detailed reasoning to maintain solution quality. Our
multi-dimensional quality assessment revealed that CoD variants maintain over
90% of CoT's code quality across key metrics including correctness,
compatibility, and maintainability, making them practical alternatives for
real-world development scenarios where efficiency matters. This research
demonstrates how domain-specific characteristics influence prompting strategy
effectiveness and provides a framework for balancing efficiency with solution
quality in software engineering applications. Our findings offer practical
guidance for optimizing LLM-based development workflows through appropriate
prompting strategy selection based on project requirements.

Result: YOTO reduces time and computational resources necessary to adapt models to new vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: This approach makes model updates faster and more resource-efficient, addressing current challenges in automated vulnerability detection.

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly

widely studied zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in terms of the
Pass@k metric. Furthermore, our method achieves these improvements with
significantly reduced token usage compared to the CoT approach, making it both
effective and resource-efficient, thereby lowering the computational demands

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) strategy for reducing the carbon footprint of AI workloads. The experiment shows FtS can reduce emissions by up to 14.6% without sacrificing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The power consumption of AI models is a growing concern due to their environmental impact. FtS is proposed as a sustainable computation model, yet scientific evidence for its efficacy is lacking.

Method: The authors conducted a synthetic experiment running four AI algorithms for anomaly detection. They compared FtS to other strategies using 2021 carbon intensity data from seven European cities.

Result: The FtS approach reduced carbon emissions by up to 14.6%, with peaks of 16.3%, while maintaining the time efficiency of training AI models.

Conclusion: FtS is an effective strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of AI workloads while retaining training performance, providing evidence for its practical use.

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of verifying large datasets in digital twins, a critical requirement for reliable industrial applications.

Method: The method involves simulating digital twin models, input-output testing, and leveraging UPPAAL model checking with timed automata to verify behavior against system-level contracts.

Result: The methodology was successfully applied to a boiler system, identifying prediction errors and demonstrating the setup's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Integrating model checking with digital twin models enhances verification processes and supports continuous improvement in industrial systems.

Abstract: Digital twins are becoming powerful tools in industrial applications,
offering virtual representations of cyber-physical systems. However,
verification of these models remains a significant challenge due to the
potentially large datasets used by the digital twin. This paper introduces an
innovative methodology for verifying neural network-based digital twin models,
in a black-box fashion, by integrating model checking into the process. The
latter relies on defining and applying system-level contracts that capture the
system's requirements, to verify the behavior of digital twin models,
implemented in Simulink. We develop an automated solution that simulates the
digital twin model for certain inputs, and feeds the predicted outputs together
with the inputs to the contract model described as a network of timed automata
in the UPPAAL model checker. The latter verifies whether the predicted outputs
fulfill the specified contracts. This approach allows us to identify scenarios
where the digital twin's behavior fails to meet the contracts, without
requiring the digital twin's design technicalities. We apply our method to a
boiler system case study for which we identify prediction errors via contract
verification. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating model
checking with digital twin models for continuous improvement.

Motivation: Software engineering student teams often struggle with effective communication and balanced contributions, hindering project success.

Method: The authors propose using social network analysis to identify communication issues in teams and developing project management tool features to help students address these issues.

Result: The evaluation involves assessing the suitability of social network analysis for identifying communication improvements and testing the proposed project management tools.

Conclusion: Using data-driven features in project management tools can guide software engineering students towards better teamwork practices and communication.

Abstract: Productive software engineering teams require effective communication and
balanced contributions between team members. However, teams are often
ineffective at these skills, which is detrimental to project success.
Project-based university courses are an opportunity for students to practise
these skills, but we have yet to establish how we can guide students towards
improving their communication and coordination. We aim to develop project
management tool features, informed by social network analysis, that nudge
students in software engineering group projects towards beneficial behaviours.
To do this, we will first evaluate the suitability of social network analysis
techniques for identifying areas of improvement in teams' communication. Then,
we will develop features in a project management tool that aid students in
identifying and addressing these areas of improvement, and evaluate them in the
context of a software engineering group project.

*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky,Alexander Zorkin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated approach to predict microservice availability using a dependency graph built from trace data, showcasing high fidelity in predictions without extensive testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservice applications often suffer from cascading failures due to complex inter-service dependencies, necessitating efficient resilience prediction methods.

Method: The authors introduce a CI/CD model discovery step to extract dependency graphs from trace data and simulate failure scenarios via Monte-Carlo methods. Results are validated through real-world chaos experiments.

Result: Predicted and observed resilience closely match, demonstrating the dependency graph's accuracy in estimating system resilience, with minor errors in measurements.

Conclusion: Automated graph models derived from trace data provide a quick and reliable method for predicting microservice availability, reducing the need for extensive failure simulations.

Abstract: Microservice applications are prone to cascading failures because of dense
inter-service dependencies. Ensuring resilience usually demands fault-injection
experiments in production-like setups. We propose \textit{model discovery} --
an automated CI/CD step that extracts a live dependency graph from trace data
-- and show that this lightweight representation is sufficient for accurate
resilience prediction. Using the DeathStarBench Social Network, we build the
graph, simulate failures via Monte-Carlo, and run matching chaos experiments on
the real system. The graph model closely matches reality: with no replication,
16 trials yield an observed resilience of 0.186 versus a predicted 0.161; with
replication, both observed and predicted values converge to 0.305 (mean
absolute error \leq 0.0004). These results indicate that even a simple,
automatically discovered graph can estimate microservice availability with high
fidelity, offering rapid design-time insight without full-scale failure
testing.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates various code models on their effectiveness in detecting code clones using multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved challenges in detecting code clones, particularly cases where structural similarity doesn't align with functional equivalence.

Method: The study systematically assesses six code models and uses five datasets to evaluate performance based on standard metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

Result: Most models show good performance overall, but some clones remain hard to detect due to differences between structure and function.

Conclusion: While the evaluated models perform well generally, challenges in detecting specific types of clones still persist.

Abstract: Detecting code clones is relevant to software maintenance and code
refactoring. This challenge still presents unresolved cases, mainly when
structural similarity does not reflect functional equivalence, though recent
code models show promise. Therefore, this research aims to systematically
measure the performance of several newly introduced small code models in
classifying code pairs as clones or non-clones. The evaluation is based on five
datasets: BigCloneBench, CodeJam, Karnalim, POJ104, and PoolC, as well as six
code models: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Salesforce T5, UniXCoder, PLBART, and
Polycoder. Most models performed well across standard metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, a marginal fraction of
clones remains challenging to detect, especially when the code looks similar
but performs different operations. The source code that illustrates our
approach is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in traditional verification and validation practices and enhancing precision in systems engineering methodologies.

Method: Employing dynamic epistemic modal logic to formalize definitions and derive theorems about the interplay between epistemic states, evidence, and reasoning.

Result: A structured theoretical framework clarifies conceptual underpinnings and provides precise and consistent definitions of verification and validation.

Conclusion: The formal theory improves understanding of verification and validation, benefiting both academic research and practical systems engineering applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a formal theory of verification and validation (V&V)
within systems engineering, grounded in the axiom that V&V are fundamentally
knowledge-building activities. Using dynamic epistemic modal logic, we develop
precise definitions of verification and validation, articulating their roles in
confirming and contextualizing knowledge about systems. The theory formalizes
the interplay between epistemic states, evidence, and reasoning processes,
allowing for the derivation of theorems that clarify the conceptual
underpinnings of V&V. By providing a formal foundation, this work addresses
ambiguities in traditional V&V practices, offering a structured framework to
enhance precision and consistency in systems engineering methodologies. The
insights gained have implications for both academic research and practical
applications, fostering a deeper understanding of V&V as critical components of
engineering knowledge generation.

### [360] [Towards Automated Formal Verification of Backend Systems with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10998)
*Kangping Xu,Yifan Luo,Yang Yuan,Andrew Chi-Chih Yao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework for software testing using functional programming, type systems, and large language models (LLMs), achieving substantial automation and cost-effectiveness in testing backend systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated software testing systems face limitations like test locality, lack of reliability, and inability to handle complex business logic, prompting the need for a more capable and scalable framework.

Method: The framework converts Scala backend code into Lean formal representations, automatically generates behavioral theorems, and utilizes LLM-based provers to verify their correctness. If the proof fails, it signifies a bug, while human intervention is required for unresolved cases.

Result: The approach formally verified over 50% of test requirements for realistic backend systems, reducing the testing workload significantly. The cost per API was $2.19, demonstrating efficiency and scalability in testing processes.

Conclusion: AI-powered automated verification shows promise for improving engineering productivity, with the ability to handle large and complex testing workloads as models continue to evolve.

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

*Atul Kumar,Diptikalyan Saha,Toshikai Yasue,Kohichi Ono,Saravanan Krishnan,Sandeep Hans,Fumiko Satoh,Gerald Mitchell,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework using symbolic execution for generating unit tests that validate semantic equivalence between legacy COBOL code and automatically translated Java code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model-based Generative AI techniques show promise for translating legacy enterprise code from COBOL to modern languages like Java, but the output code's accuracy and trustworthiness need validation.

Method: The paper introduces symbolic execution-based test generation to automatically create unit tests for original COBOL programs. These tests are then converted to equivalent JUnit test cases for the translated Java code to check semantic equivalence.

Result: The framework successfully validates equivalence of COBOL and translated Java programs. It also facilitates code repair and provides feedback to AI models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-driven code translation by verifying, repairing, and improving the translated code with semantic equivalence checks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

*Ketai Qiu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: E-Test uses Large Language Models to improve test suites by identifying and addressing inadequately tested behaviors emerging from production usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing test suites to reflect real-world software production scenarios ensures sustainable software quality.

Method: E-Test incrementally augments test suites by employing Large Language Models to classify unit execution scenarios and add corresponding test cases.

Result: E-Test demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for identifying inadequately tested behaviors and optimizing test suites.

Conclusion: The approach enhances test suite quality by addressing gaps in testing and incorporating dynamic production-based behaviors.

Abstract: Augmenting test suites with test cases that reflect the actual usage of the
software system is extremely important to sustain the quality of long lasting
software systems. In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that
incrementally augments a test suite with test cases that exercise behaviors
that emerge in production and that are not been tested yet. E-Test leverages
Large Language Models to identify already-tested, not-yet-tested, and
error-prone unit execution scenarios, and augment the test suite accordingly.
Our experimental evaluation shows that E-Test outperforms the main
state-of-the-art approaches to identify inadequately tested behaviors and
optimize test suites.

### [363] [Rethinking Technological Readiness in the Era of AI Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11001)
*S. Tucker Browne,Mark M. Bailey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI Readiness Framework for assessing military AI systems' maturity and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing technology readiness assessments are inadequate for addressing AI-specific factors in military systems.

Method: The authors develop an AI Readiness Framework analogous to Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), tailored to assess reliability, safety, and other critical aspects of AI for combat use.

Result: The feasibility of this framework is demonstrated using current data tools and testing practices.

Conclusion: The framework provides decision-makers better tools to evaluate AI system deployment readiness, advancing military technology management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

### [364] [Notes On Writing Effective Empirical Software Engineering Papers: An Opinionated Primer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11002)
*Roberto Verdecchia,Justus Bogner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper provides guidance for writing Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) papers, targeting students and researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many find writing ESE papers challenging, and there is limited discussion on best practices in the field despite their implicit use in evaluations.

Method: The authors present subjective and personal advice based on their experiences, aimed primarily at their students but applicable more broadly.

Result: A structured and opinionated guide for writing ESE papers is provided, helping address common difficulties and confusion.

Conclusion: The authors hope their guide will assist others in improving their ESE writing practices, acknowledging the advice is subjective and not universally applicable.

Abstract: While mastered by some, good scientific writing practices within Empirical
Software Engineering (ESE) research appear to be seldom discussed and
documented. Despite this, these practices are implicit or even explicit
evaluation criteria of typical software engineering conferences and journals.
In this pragmatic, educational-first document, we want to provide guidance to
those who may feel overwhelmed or confused by writing ESE papers, but also
those more experienced who still might find an opinionated collection of
writing advice useful. The primary audience we had in mind for this paper were
our own BSc, MSc, and PhD students, but also students of others. Our documented
advice therefore reflects a subjective and personal vision of writing ESE
papers. By no means do we claim to be fully objective, generalizable, or
representative of the whole discipline. With that being said, writing papers in
this way has worked pretty well for us so far. We hope that this guide can at
least partially do the same for others.

### [365] [EmbedAgent: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Embedded System Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11003)
*Ruiyang Xu,Jialun Cao,Mingyuan Wu,Wenliang Zhong,Yaojie Lu,Ben He,Xianpei Han,Shing-Chi Cheung,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces "EmbedAgent," a framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedded system tasks, accompanied by a benchmark named "Embedbench." It reveals performance shortcomings of LLMs in certain embedded system operations and proposes two strategies to enhance their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap in evaluating LLMs in the domain of embedded systems, which connects digital tools to physical systems, and to foresee their usability and limitations in this specialized field.

Method: The paper develops the EmbedAgent paradigm to simulate real-world roles in embedded system tasks and creates Embedbench, a benchmark with 126 cases across multiple electronic components and hardware platforms. Extensive experiments are conducted on 10 LLMs to assess their performance.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 achieves only modest performance rates, highlighting weaknesses of LLMs in embedded tasks. While migration to MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico yields relatively stronger results (73.8% pass@1), results for migrations to ESP-IDF lag significantly (up to 29.4% pass@1). Two enhancement strategies lead to improved accuracy in various tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that current LLMs face challenges in embedded system development tasks and suggests that retrieval-augmented generation and compiler feedback can improve their performance. This advances the future role of LLMs in this niche domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

*Mouna Dhaouadi,Bentley Oakes,Michalis Famelis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated approach to analyze open source software rationale conflicts using pre-trained models and LLMs, tested on the Linux Kernel and other projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contributors to open source software face challenges due to the manual effort required to ensure new contributions align with past decisions. Automation for rationale analysis is missing.

Method: The paper implements an instantiation of the Kantara architecture using pre-trained models and Large Language Models to detect reasoning conflicts and design erosion.

Result: The approach demonstrated feasibility and reasonable performance with the Linux Kernel and generalized successfully to five other active open source projects.

Conclusion: The automated rationale analysis can help developers proactively address conflicts and maintain coherence in their projects.

Abstract: Contributors to open source software must deeply understand a project's
history to make coherent decisions which do not conflict with past reasoning.
However, inspecting all related changes to a proposed contribution requires
intensive manual effort, and previous research has not yet produced an
automated mechanism to expose and analyze these conflicts. In this article, we
propose such an automated approach for rationale analyses, based on an
instantiation of Kantara, an existing high-level rationale extraction and
management architecture. Our implementation leverages pre-trained models and
Large Language Models, and includes structure-based mechanisms to detect
reasoning conflicts and problems which could cause design erosion in a project
over time. We show the feasibility of our extraction and analysis approach
using the OOM-Killer module of the Linux Kernel project, and investigate the
approach's generalization to five other highly active open source projects. The
results confirm that our automated approach can support rationale analyses with
reasonable performance, by finding interesting relationships and to detect
potential conflicts and reasoning problems. We also show the effectiveness of
the automated extraction of decision and rationale sentences and the prospects
for generalizing this to other open source projects. This automated approach
could therefore be used by open source software developers to proactively
address hidden issues and to ensure that new changes do not conflict with past
decisions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper outlines a comprehensive pipeline for systematically testing autonomous drones across sequential stages to ensure safety and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With drones increasingly impacting critical industries, ensuring their safe and reliable operation during real-world missions is essential.

Method: The paper proposes and demonstrates a four-stage testing pipeline: SIL Simulation Testing, HIL Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing.

Result: Using examples like autonomous landing systems, the study highlights how to verify system behaviors, address integration issues, and optimize drone performance.

Conclusion: The pipeline facilitates thorough validation, reduces deployment risks, and equips autonomous drones for secure and efficient real-world use.

Abstract: Autonomous drones are rapidly reshaping industries ranging from aerial
delivery and infrastructure inspection to environmental monitoring and disaster
response. Ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of these systems is
paramount as they transition from research prototypes to mission-critical
platforms. This paper presents a step-by-step guide to establishing a robust
autonomous drone testing pipeline, covering each critical stage:
Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Simulation Testing, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)
Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing. Using practical
examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate
how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration
issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends
shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic
and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled
simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and
researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks,
and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses generating Java test code from English descriptions using Large Language Models, utilizing techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering, and fine-tuning for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to generate accurate and developer-like test code from natural language input, addressing shortcomings of straightforward LLM prompting.

Method: The research applies RAG and static program analysis for context expansion, alongside fine-tuning the LLM with custom prompts including pre-dependent classes and exemplar outputs.

Result: Fine-tuning an 8x7b Mixture of Experts model improved conformity to developer test code by 8%, performing comparably to a larger 8x22b MoE model.

Conclusion: Integrating RAG and fine-tuning significantly enhances code generation accuracy without requiring extremely large models.

Abstract: We describe test code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) in
Ericsson. Our input is a test step in natural language (English) and our output
is code (Java) which accomplishes the test step. We describe how straight
forward prompting does not suffice and results in LLM assuming functions and
signatures which are not present in the code repository. We then show how we
alleviate the problem by a combination of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
along with prompt engineering that expanded the simple prompt with additional
contextual information using static program analysis. We then describe further
improvements that we obtained by fine-tuning the underlying LLM. The fine
tuning is done based on a custom designed prompt template which has
pre-dependent classes, their public methods as well two exemplar outputs
obtained from RAG. Our results establish that our fine tuned models help
improve the correspondence or conformity with the original developer written
test code as measured by the traditional metrics of F1-score based on the
methods used in the generated code. Fine tuning of a 8x7b Mixture of Experts
(MoE) model leads to an average improvement of 8\% over the base model and is
comparable to the scores on a much larger 8x22b MoE model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLM comprehension of legacy languages, especially in the context of real-world systems with poor or inaccurate documentation.

Method: The authors employed multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) as a quantitative method to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the role of comments.

Result: Preliminary findings indicate that documentation and comment quality influence LLM understanding of legacy code.

Conclusion: Future work is needed to refine evaluation methods and develop strategies for enhancing LLM comprehension of legacy programming languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

compression strategies and their tradeoffs in terms of size, readability, and
historical significance. This method addresses the challenge of making
historically significant software artifacts available through modern mobile
devices without requiring specialized hardware or internet connectivity. While
numerous digital preservation methods exist for historic software, this
approach balances accessibility with historical significance, offering a
complementary method to traditional archival techniques. This work contributes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in embedding AI-assisted tasks within IDEs, aiming to streamline workflows by integrating AI effectively.

Method: The researchers developed MultiMind, a modular and extensible plug-in for Visual Studio Code, allowing simpler implementation and experimentation with AI interactions.

Result: MultiMind has been applied to two scenarios: automatic code comment generation and defining AI-powered chat interactions.

Conclusion: MultiMind makes integrating AI into development workflows more accessible, reducing complexity and enhancing flexibility within IDEs.

Abstract: The integration of AI assistants into software development workflows is
rapidly evolving, shifting from automation-assisted tasks to collaborative
interactions between developers and AI. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their effectiveness in several development activities, including
code completion, test case generation, and documentation production. However,
embedding AI-assisted tasks within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
presents significant challenges. It requires designing mechanisms to invoke AI
assistants at the appropriate time, coordinate interactions with multiple
assistants, process the generated outputs, and present feedback in a way that
seamlessly integrates with the development workflow. To address these issues,
we introduce MultiMind, a Visual Studio Code plug-in that streamlines the
creation of AI-assisted development tasks. MultiMind provides a modular and
extensible framework, enabling developers to cost-effectively implement and
experiment with new AI-powered interactions without the need for complex IDE
customizations. MultiMind has been tested in two use cases: one for the
automatic generation of code comments and the other about the definition of
AI-powered chat.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ZjsComponent is a lightweight, browser-dependent web component framework for modular and reusable UI creation without any dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the creation of modular and reusable web UI components, reducing developer overhead and dependencies.

Method: Introduces ZjsComponent, which uses native browser JavaScript capabilities to dynamically load and isolate HTML+JS fragments while avoiding build steps or external tools.

Result: Provides a framework-agnostic and dependency-free approach to interface design with features like DOM isolation and lifecycle hooks.

Conclusion: ZjsComponent simplifies web UI development by offering a developer-friendly, dependency-free, and highly modular approach.

Abstract: In this paper, I present ZjsComponent, a lightweight and framework-agnostic
web component designed for creating modular, reusable UI elements with minimal
developer overhead. ZjsComponent is an example implementation of an approach to
creating components and object instances that can be used purely from HTML.
Unlike traditional approaches to components, the approach implemented by
ZjsComponent does not require build-steps, transpiling, pre-compilation, any
specific ecosystem or any other dependency. All that is required is that the
browser can load and execute Javascript as needed by Web Components.
ZjsComponent allows dynamic loading and isolation of HTML+JS fragments,
offering developers a simple way to build reusable interfaces with ease. This
approach is dependency-free, provides significant DOM and code isolation, and
supports simple lifecycle hooks as well as traditional methods expected of an
instance of a class.

*Grigory Tsiperman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating requirements traceability into the design process through Adaptive Clustering Method (ACM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the integration of requirements traceability into information system design, addressing its importance for validation, verification, and reducing dependencies.

Method: The authors propose the Adaptive Clustering Method (ACM) for seamless coordination between different levels of project artifacts.

Result: ACM enables explicit interconnection among various abstraction levels in information system projects, facilitating traceability.

Conclusion: Integrating ACM into information system design enhances traceability, making systems less developer-dependent and simplifying validation.

Abstract: The traceability of requirements in the information system design process is
considered an essential property of the project, one of its quality
characteristics. The point here is that traceability provides the methods of
validation and verification of software systems, and that the system model
based on requirements traceability reduces the system's dependence on
developers and, in general, makes it as straightforward as possible. One of the
challenges of the traceability process, dubbed "The grand challenge of
traceability" among traceability researchers, is its integration into the
design process. In this paper, to achieve this goal, we propose the application
of the Adaptive Clustering Method (ACM) of Information Systems developed by the
author, which is based on the idea of a seamless system architecture that
provides explicit interconnection of project artifacts of different levels of
abstraction.

Abstract: AI development environments are evolving into observability first platforms
that integrate real time telemetry, prompt traces, and evaluation feedback into
the developer workflow. This paper introduces telemetry aware integrated
development environments (IDEs) enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
system that connects IDEs with prompt metrics, trace logs, and versioned
control for real time refinement. We present design patterns for local prompt
iteration, CI based optimization, and autonomous agents that adapt behavior
using telemetry. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we describe an
architecture that supports integration with frameworks like DSPy, PromptWizard,
and Prompts as Programs. We demonstrate this through Opik, an open source MCP
server for LLM telemetry, and position our approach within the emerging LLMOps
ecosystem. This work lays a foundation for future research on prompt
optimization, IDE agent tooling, and empirical benchmarking in telemetry rich

### [379] [Eliminating Hallucination-Induced Errors in LLM Code Generation with Functional Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11021)
*Chaitanya Ravuri,Saman Amarasinghe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces functional clustering, a method to eliminate hallucination-induced errors in code-generation by clustering outputs with identical behavior, offering reliable autonomous code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code-generation models often produce unreliable outputs due to subtle errors. A dependable method is needed to enhance reliability for autonomous code deployment.

Method: The approach samples candidate programs, evaluates their behavior on a self-generated test suite, and clusters outputs with matching I/O behavior. Reliability is tuned with a confidence threshold based on empirical mass of clusters.

Result: The method reduces error rates in output answers from ~65% to 2%, and achieves 0% error rate at conservative thresholds, while maintaining significant task coverage (15.6% prompts answered).

Conclusion: Functional clustering improves reliability in code-generation without requiring model changes, creating a sustainable path for future autonomous code-generation applications using sandbox execution and sampling.

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

### [380] [Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation -- A Systematic Analysis of the Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11022)
*Shivani Shukla,Himanshu Joshi,Romilla Syed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines security degradation in AI-generated code through iterative refinements, revealing an increase in critical vulnerabilities after multiple LLM iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used for code generation, but their iterative refinement process potentially introduces security vulnerabilities, which needs investigation.

Method: The study involves a controlled experiment on 400 code samples, analyzing security vulnerabilities across 40 rounds of iterative 'improvements' using four different prompting strategies.

Result: Critical vulnerabilities increased by 37.6% after five iterations, highlighting distinct vulnerability patterns based on prompting strategies.

Conclusion: Iterative LLM refinement doesn't necessarily enhance code security and may introduce new vulnerabilities. It underscores the necessity of human validation and offers guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

*Sung Une Lee,Liming Dong,Zhenchang Xing,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Stefan Avgoustakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Software Security Mapping Framework to operationalize security requirements across software development levels using a structured, actionable methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between abstract security principles and actionable practices, especially in complex modern software development environments.

Method: The framework systematically maps 131 security requirements to over 400 actionable steps, utilizing the KAOS goal modeling methodology and providing a web-based tool and OSCAL Catalog Model for implementation.

Result: The framework was validated with a case study (Log4j vulnerability) to generate a tailored checklist aligned with best practices, showcasing its utility in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The Software Security Mapping Framework improves clarity, accountability, and operational efficiency in software security practices, offering practical tools for adoption and automation.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern software development environments has
heightened concerns around supply chain security. However, existing frameworks
often fall short in translating abstract security principles into concrete,
actionable practices. This paper introduces the Software Security Mapping
Framework, a structured solution designed to operationalize security
requirements across hierarchical levels -- from high-level regulatory standards
(e.g., ISM, Australia cybersecurity standard published by the Australian
Signals Directorate), through mid-level frameworks (e.g., NIST SSDF, the U.S.
Secure Software Development Framework), to fine-grained technical activities
(e.g., SLSA, a software supply chain security framework). Developed through
collaborative research with academic experts and industry practitioners, the
framework systematically maps 131 refined security requirements to over 400
actionable operational steps spanning the software development lifecycle. It is
grounded in four core security goals: Secure Software Environment, Secure
Software Development, Software Traceability, and Vulnerability Management. Our
approach leverages the KAOS goal modeling methodology to establish traceable
linkages between strategic goals and tactical operations, enhancing clarity,
accountability, and practical implementation. To facilitate adoption, we
provide a web-based navigation tool for interactive exploration of the
framework. A real-world case study based on the Log4j vulnerability illustrates
the framework's utility by generating a tailored checklist aligned with
industry best practices. Additionally, we offer a structured, machine-readable
OSCAL Catalog Model of the Software Security Mapping Framework, enabling
organizations to automate implementation, streamline compliance processes, and
respond effectively to evolving security risks.

*Ziga Kovacic,Celine Lee,Justin Chiu,Wenting Zhao,Kevin Ellis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the importance of maintainable and general software by exploring how code agents can refactor specialized solutions into reusable components, introducing a method and benchmark for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Build efficient, robust applications by enhancing code maintainability and reusability, especially as code agents gain accuracy in solving isolated programming problems.

Method: The authors propose Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries, and develop Minicode, a benchmark designed for refactoring independent code into joint libraries.

Result: Librarian achieves significant improvements in compression rates (1.6-2x better) and correctness compared to state-of-the-art code agents, validated on the Minicode benchmark.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that Librarian is effective in refactoring code for reusability and correctness, providing a beneficial tool alongside the open-sourced benchmark Minicode.

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

*Hanxi Guo,Siyuan Cheng,Kaiyuan Zhang,Guangyu Shen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeMirage, a comprehensive benchmark for detecting AI-generated code, addressing limitations in programming language coverage, model variety, and evaluation robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the ethical and secure use of AI-generated code by detecting misuse such as plagiarism and license violations, as existing benchmarks are insufficient in reflecting real-world conditions.

Method: The authors developed CodeMirage, a benchmark that spans ten programming languages, includes both original and paraphrased code, and integrates outputs from ten state-of-the-art LLMs. They evaluated ten detectors under four configurations with three metrics.

Result: Nine critical findings emerged, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of existing AI-generated code detectors, as well as challenges for future development of more robust detection systems.

Conclusion: CodeMirage fills a crucial gap as a rigorous and versatile testbed for developing reliable and generalizable detectors for AI-generated code, aiming to enhance ethical use of such technologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Code Researcher, a deep research agent for systems code, excelling at generating crash-mitigating patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based coding agents struggle with the complexity of systems code, requiring tools to gather and synthesize extensive context for tasks like patch generation.

Method: The authors design Code Researcher to use multi-step reasoning and structured memory for analyzing code semantics, patterns, and commit history, synthesizing patches to resolve crashes.

Result: Code Researcher outperforms baselines, achieving a 58% crash-resolution rate on Linux kernel benchmarks as compared to 37.5% by SWE-agent, and demonstrates generalizability.

Conclusion: The study shows that deep exploration and structured reasoning are crucial for addressing complex systems code issues, highlighting Code Researcher's effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoQuIR introduces a benchmark for quality-aware code retrieval, focusing on correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability, and evaluates 23 models showing a gap in recognizing robust code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code retrieval benchmarks neglect software quality dimensions like correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability.

Method: CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations, new evaluation metrics, benchmarks on 23 models, and synthetic data experiments to improve quality-aware retrieval.

Result: Top-performing models struggle with distinguishing low-quality code but show improvement when trained with quality-focused datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems is essential for advancing trustworthy and robust software development tools.

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li,Ling-I Wu,Ruibang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCE-LLM, an automated dead code elimination framework, improving upon existing tools by using a CodeBERT model and LLMs for detection, explanation, and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dead code in software leads to issues like increased maintenance complexity, potential security vulnerabilities, and hinders LLM-based code tasks. Current tools lack a universal and automated solution, motivating this work.

Method: The approach employs CodeBERT for identifying suspect lines of code and leverages fine-tuned LLMs for providing judgment, detailed explanations, and automated corrections, trained on a large dead code annotation dataset.

Result: DCE-LLM surpasses existing tools, achieving over 94% F1 scores for detection of unused and unreachable code, and demonstrates a 30% performance improvement compared to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: DCE-LLM provides an efficient, automated, and multi-language-supported solution for dead code detection and elimination, significantly enhancing accuracy and usability over traditional methods.

Abstract: Dead code introduces several challenges in software development, such as
increased binary size and maintenance difficulties. It can also obscure logical
errors and be exploited for obfuscation in malware. For LLM-based code-related
tasks, dead code introduces vulnerabilities that can mislead these models,
raising security concerns. Although modern compilers and IDEs offer dead code
elimination, sophisticated patterns can bypass these tools. A universal
approach that includes classification, location, explanation, and correction is
needed, yet current tools often require significant manual effort. We present
DCE-LLM, a framework for automated dead code elimination using a small CodeBERT
model with an attribution-based line selector to efficiently locate suspect
code. LLMs then generate judgments and explanations, fine-tuned on a
large-scale, annotated dead code dataset to provide detailed explanations and
patches. DCE-LLM outperforms existing tools, with advanced unreachability
detection, automated correction, and support for multiple programming
languages. Experimental results show DCE-LLM achieves over 94% F1 scores for
unused and unreachable code, significantly surpassing GPT-4o by 30%.

significant automation of programming through software frameworks and a huge
set of third-party libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs). All
these tools provide most of the necessary functionality out of the box (already
implemented), and quite naturally the question arises as to what is more useful
for students - to teach how to use these ready-made tools or the basic
principles of working and development of web applications from scratch. This
paper analyzes the results of a survey conducted among IT employers, aimed to
identify what, in their opinion, are the necessary technical skills that
graduating students in the field of Web Programming should possess in order to
join the company's work as quickly and effectively as possible.

powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat

### [389] [Denoising Programming Knowledge Tracing with a Code Graph-based Tuning Adaptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11107)
*Weibo Gao,Qi Liu,Rui Li,Yuze Zhao,Hao Wang,Linan Yre,Fangzhou Yao,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Coda, a model-agnostic framework, to improve Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) by mitigating noise in coding activities using a code graph and cluster-aware GCN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PKT approaches struggle with noise from unrelated or weak signals in prolonged programming activities, limiting their performance. There is a need for a solution to address these issues for personalized programming education.

Method: The authors propose Coda, which converts loose code sequences into a compact code graph. It uses semantic similarity to identify unwanted signals and a cluster-aware GCN to recognize weak signals. The noise-corrected framework is integrated into PKT models with optimization constraints and regularization.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Coda improves PKT task performance significantly even in noisy environments, surpassing traditional baselines.

Conclusion: Coda enhances PKT models by effectively addressing noise-related challenges, ensuring more accurate tracking of learners’ programming knowledge while being adaptable to various PKT solutions.

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

TL;DR: LLMs can streamline Modeling & Simulation tasks as middleware, but need proper integration to avoid compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify complex Modeling & Simulation workflows while maintaining high-quality and reliability.

Method: Introduce LLM-mediated workflows, suggest structured tool integration, and propose Low-Rank Adaptation-based architectures.

Result: Efficiency in M&S processes achieved by using LLMs as task-specific translators with reduced complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs should support, not replace, specialized tools, ensuring interoperability and reliable Modeling & Simulation workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for Modeling &
Simulation (M&S) through natural language interfaces that simplify workflows.
However, over-reliance risks compromising quality due to ambiguities, logical
shortcuts, and hallucinations. This paper advocates integrating LLMs as
middleware or translators between specialized tools to mitigate complexity in
M&S tasks. Acting as translators, LLMs can enhance interoperability across
multi-formalism, multi-semantics, and multi-paradigm systems. We address two
key challenges: identifying appropriate languages and tools for modeling and
simulation tasks, and developing efficient software architectures that
integrate LLMs without performance bottlenecks. To this end, the paper explores
LLM-mediated workflows, emphasizes structured tool integration, and recommends
Low-Rank Adaptation-based architectures for efficient task-specific
adaptations. This approach ensures LLMs complement rather than replace
specialized tools, fostering high-quality, reliable M&S processes.

*Changxin Ke,Rui Zhang,Shuo Wang,Li Ding,Guangli Li,Yuanbo Wen,Shuoming Zhang,Ruiyuan Xu,Jin Qin,Jiaming Guo,Chenxi Wang,Ling Li,Qi Guo,Yunji Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents an innovative Mutual-Supervised Learning framework addressing challenges in translating sequential to parallel code, improving functional equivalence and translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of GPU-based parallel programming, such as CUDA, demands automated, reliable sequential-to-parallel code translation, especially addressing functional equivalence due to scarce data.

Method: The Mutual-Supervised Learning framework involves two models, Translator and Tester, in iterative Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, where Tester validates code functionality while Translator augments data, improving each other.

Result: The approach boosts base model performance (Pass@1 by 28.91%, Tester by 68.90%), surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks like CodeRosetta in BLEU and CodeBLEU, and achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: Mutual-Supervised Learning is an effective framework for enhancing sequential-to-parallel code translation, providing superior functional equivalence and competitive scores compared to leading innovations.

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL
significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to
Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester
performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while
achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is
available at https://github.com/kcxain/musl.

### [392] [Beyond Formal Semantics for Capabilities and Skills: Model Context Protocol in Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11180)
*Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva,Aljosha Köcher,Felix Gehlhoff*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a way to make capabilities and skills accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling flexible industrial automation without relying on explicit semantic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for representing capabilities and skills require significant manual input and are not easily accessible by LLMs. The authors aim to overcome this limitation.

Method: The study employs MCP to expose resource functions through a standardized interface, which is applied to a laboratory manufacturing system. It evaluates how an LLM can use MCP to plan and execute complex tasks involving constraints and resource invocation.

Result: Experimental results show that LLMs can effectively interact with MCP-based interfaces to execute multi-step industrial processes, demonstrating flexibility in automation.

Conclusion: The MCP approach offers a promising alternative for integrating external tools in LLM-driven systems, paving the way for advancements in industrial automation.

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Brent Paulovicks,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper enhances LLM-based automated evaluation for Bash code generation in IT incident remediation using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving code evaluation systems for automatic IT incident remediation, aiming for syntactic and semantic correctness, and execution reliability.

Method: Implemented an enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge system by combining bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for code validation.

Result: Achieved high accuracy (up to 8% improvement over baseline) and developed Reflection code agents, boosting refinement accuracy by 24%.

Conclusion: Enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge metrics and Reflection code agents substantially improved automatic code validation and refinement for incident remediation tools.

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores converting NL2SQL datasets into NL2API datasets using a novel pipeline to study LLMs' performance in tool-calling tasks. Results show low task completion rates, indicating potential for significant improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges LLMs face in enterprise environments where interacting with large and complex API collections backed by databases is crucial.

Method: The authors create a pipeline that uses SQL query syntax from NL2SQL datasets to generate functionally equivalent API sequences and create new NL2API datasets for evaluation.

Result: The study finds LLMs have low task completion rates (7-47%), which improve marginally (to 50%) when employing live API environments. It highlights weaknesses in current tool-calling capabilities.

Conclusion: The research reveals that current LLMs are insufficient for general-use tool-calling applications, suggesting the need for substantial advancements in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of managing the increasing complexity of ML-Enabled Systems (MLES) effectively.

Method: The paper proposes a metrics-based architectural model and compares architectural representations of two case-study systems: SPIRA and Ocean Guard.

Result: Insights into system complexity management are derived through the use of the proposed model on SPIRA and Ocean Guard MLES.

Conclusion: The metrics-based architectural model aids in guiding architectural decisions and promoting sustainable growth in MLES.

creating the metrics-based architectural model: the SPIRA and the Ocean Guard

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReVeal improves decision-making in large language models (LLMs) by integrating code generation, self-verification, and tool-based evaluation supported by reinforcement learning (RL) techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with accurate self-verification and fail to utilize realistic verification signals from complex environments effectively.

Method: ReVeal employs a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that intertwines code generation, self-verification, and external tool usage to optimize reasoning capabilities, with dense per-turn rewards driving the learning.

Result: ReVeal significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities, achieving superior Pass@k results on LiveCodeBench and surpassing alternative methods including DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.

Conclusion: ReVeal represents a robust, scalable framework for developing advanced LLMs capable of autonomous evolution in reasoning and verification tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome
rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

TL;DR: The paper conducts a large-scale analysis of over 497,000 issues from GitHub blockchain projects using BERTopic for classification into 49 topics, focusing on temporal evolution and issue resolution times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand development challenges in blockchain-based software systems, as they are increasingly used in diverse domains.

Method: Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, the paper analyzes issues from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects to identify 49 topics and study their trends and resolution times.

Result: The study found equal representation of general software and blockchain-specific issues, with Wallet Management being the most frequent and slowest to resolve. Issue frequency peaked post-2016 with Ethereum’s rise but declined after 2022.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to better understanding blockchain software maintenance, suggesting targeted tools and practices to improve these systems' robustness and maintainability.

Abstract: Blockchain-based software systems are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, yet a systematic understanding of their development challenges remains
limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues
mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing
BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct
issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our
analysis reveals that both general software development issues and
blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet
Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further
examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times,
finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the
longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved
significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of
Ethereum and decentralized applications, but declined after 2022. These
findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance,
informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve
robustness and maintainability.

### [398] [VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484)
*Haoshen,Ming Hu,Xiaofei Xie,Jiaye Li,Mingsong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents VulStamp, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) for description-free vulnerability severity assessment, focusing on intention-guided analysis and addressing imbalanced data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vulnerability assessments rely on manually crafted and often inconsistent descriptions, limiting their usefulness and increasing development costs for vulnerabilities with low exploitability or negligible impact.

Method: The paper introduces VulStamp, which integrates static analysis and large language models (LLMs) to extract intention information of vulnerable code, then applies a prompt-tuned model and reinforcement learning (RL) for severity assessment while managing data imbalance.

Result: VulStamp facilitates accurate vulnerability assessment without relying on manual descriptions, effectively addressing imbalanced data challenges using RL-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach optimizes vulnerability severity assessment by providing a robust, description-free methodology informed by static analysis and LLMs, leading to more efficient and targeted software development strategies.

Abstract: Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to
efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation
efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly
true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either
possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical
operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has
emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency.
Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted
descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability
in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the
performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this
paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate
description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static
analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention
information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp
uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to
mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types,
VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to
train the assessment model.

*Michael Grohs,Nadine Cordes,Jana-Rebecca Rehse*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to systematically assess the desirability of deviations in process executions, linking them to action recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformance checking tools lack the ability to determine whether deviations in process models are problematic, acceptable, or beneficial, leading to manual and subjective assessments by analysts.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review and interviews with practitioners and researchers to design a systematic, step-by-step framework, which was evaluated through a task involving practitioners.

Result: The proposed framework helps streamline the desirability assessment process, enabling a more organized and concise evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework provides process analysts with a practical tool to classify deviations based on their desirability and link them to actionable steps, addressing limitations of current ad-hoc methods.

Abstract: Conformance checking techniques help process analysts to identify where and
how process executions deviate from a process model. However, they cannot
determine the desirability of these deviations, i.e., whether they are
problematic, acceptable or even beneficial for the process. Such desirability
assessments are crucial to derive actions, but process analysts typically
conduct them in a manual, ad-hoc way, which can be time-consuming, subjective,
and irreplicable. To address this problem, this paper presents a procedural
framework to guide process analysts in systematically assessing deviation
desirability. It provides a step-by-step approach for identifying which input
factors to consider in what order to categorize deviations into mutually
exclusive desirability categories, each linked to action recommendations. The
framework is based on a review and conceptualization of existing literature on
deviation desirability, which is complemented by empirical insights from
interviews with process analysis practitioners and researchers. We evaluate the
framework through a desirability assessment task conducted with practitioners,
indicating that the framework effectively enables them to streamline the
assessment for a thorough yet concise evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper examines the potential of LLMs in software engineering outside of code generation, focusing on tasks like conceptualization, design, and identifying hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the underexplored potential of LLMs in broader software engineering practices beyond code-focused tasks.

Method: The work involves studying LLM performance on non-code tasks, creating benchmarks for foundational SE knowledge, and developing methods to detect hallucinations on SE statements.

Result: Initial results demonstrate promising improvements in performance for non-code software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: The advancements could lead to more capable LLMs tailored for comprehensive software engineering use-cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering (SE),
with special emphasis on code generation and analysis. However, their
applications to broader SE practices including conceptualization, design, and
other non-code tasks, remain partially underexplored. This research aims to
augment the generality and performance of LLMs for SE by (1) advancing the
understanding of how LLMs with different characteristics perform on various
non-code tasks, (2) evaluating them as sources of foundational knowledge in SE,
and (3) effectively detecting hallucinations on SE statements. The expected
contributions include a variety of LLMs trained and evaluated on
domain-specific datasets, new benchmarks on foundational knowledge in SE, and
methods for detecting hallucinations. Initial results in terms of performance
improvements on various non-code tasks are promising.

*Gábor Antal,Dénes Bán,Martin Isztin,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates GPT-4's ability to automatically generate vulnerability-focused unit tests, achieving 66.5% syntactic correctness and limited semantic validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assist developers and security experts by exploring how GPT-4 can help with automated unit test generation as manual testing is labor-intensive.

Method: The authors used a subset of the VUL4J dataset to assess GPT-4's performance, focusing on syntactic and semantic correctness, context impact, self-correction ability, and usability of generated tests.

Result: GPT-4 produced syntactically correct test cases 66.5% of the time, with semantic correctness validated in only 7.5% of cases. Subjective evaluations found templates promising for further development.

Conclusion: GPT-4 shows potential in generating vulnerability-focused test templates that can streamline manual effort, suggesting its usefulness in partially automated processes.

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

TL;DR: The study evaluates GPT-4o's performance in repairing Java vulnerabilities, showing mixed results compared to GPT-4 but highlighting the benefits of enriched contextual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how advanced LLMs like GPT-4o can improve automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems, particularly with tailored contextual information.

Method: The team compared GPT-4o against GPT-4 using identical and newly crafted prompts, incorporating different contextual data (e.g., CWE, CVE) across 42 vulnerabilities, validated by Vul4J's framework.

Result: GPT-4o fixes 10.5% more unique vulnerabilities across runs but performs 11.9% worse on average compared to GPT-4. Enhanced prompts, particularly those with CVE and code context, improve repair rates.

Conclusion: While GPT-4o has limitations versus GPT-4 in replicable performance, ensemble prompts utilizing CVE and context can enhance its utility in zero-shot vulnerability repair scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the impacts of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on software developers, highlighting improvements but challenges in integrating practices into the workplace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress is prevalent in software development environments, yet MBSR programs have not been studied in this specific context.

Method: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with both software developers who participated in MBSR and the instructor who led the program.

Result: Participants showed personal improvement in managing stress, yet struggled to incorporate MBSR techniques into their work routines.

Conclusion: While MBSR is beneficial for stress management, its practical workplace integration requires further exploration and support.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a qualitative study
(i.e., semi-structured interviews) on how a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR) program, carried out in the Software Development (SD) working context,
is perceived by the software developers of a multinational company who
participated in the MBSR program and by the instructor who led it. MBSR is a
deeply personal and experiential practice in helping individuals manage stress,
particularly in high-pressure environments such as workplaces, healthcare
settings, education, and other demanding professional or personal situations.
Although MBSR has been experimented in different working contexts;
surprisingly, it has never been studied in the SD working context where there
are several stress factors that developers experience (e.g., time pressure and
uncertainty about the content of a particular task and its outcome). In this
respect, qualitative research can generate valuable insights into the
application of MBSR in the SD working context that cannot be captured by
standardized quantitative measures. Being MBSR instructors and software
developers the key stakeholders in delivering an MBSR program in the SD working
context, understanding their first-hand experiences can provide a more detailed
picture of the investigated phenomenon. The most important takeaway result of
our research can be summarized as follows: despite initial skepticism, the
developers recognized personal improvements due to the MBSR practice, though
the integration of MBSR techniques in the working context remained challenging.

### [404] [Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591)
*Hyunsun Hong,Jongmoon Baik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for automated code review comment generation (RCG) to combine the strengths of generation-based and information retrieval (IR)-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of automated code review comment generation either struggle with generating low-frequency but semantically important tokens (generation-based) or lack adaptability to novel code contexts (IR-based).

Method: The paper introduces a RAG approach, where pretrained language models are conditioned on retrieved code-review examples, guiding them to produce accurate comments.

Result: RAG-based RCG performs better than traditional generation-based and IR-based methods, achieving +1.67% higher exact match, +4.25% higher BLEU scores, and up to 24.01% improvement in generating low-frequency tokens.

Conclusion: Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation enables more effective and context-aware code review comment generation, and performance improves with an increased number of retrieved examples.

Abstract: Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by
automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing
approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language
models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past
examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on
large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between
code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but
semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast,
IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing
examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example,
when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval
database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this
work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by
conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By
providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been
previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review
comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based
RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to
+1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to
generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency
ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance
improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.

Motivation: The study seeks to address the controversy surrounding the external validity of using students in software engineering experiments and their relevance to the industry.

Method: A comparative bug-fixing task was conducted with 62 students and 42 professionals under differing experimental conditions, with students and professionals working in different levels of realism.

Result: Data revealed that students outperformed professionals in the bug-fixing task, contradicting earlier empirical evidence.

Conclusion: The study suggests rethinking the use of students in experiments, highlighting the need for more realistic and complex experimental setups to better understand influencing factors in software engineering.

Abstract: Most Software Engineering (SE) human-based controlled experiments rely on
students as participants, raising concerns about their external validity.
Specifically, the realism of results obtained from students and their
applicability to the software industry remains in question. In this short
paper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we
compare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the
same Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in
Computer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational
companies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some
variations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and
professionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the
experiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress
factors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the
differences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that
the students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs. This diverges to
some extent from past empirical evidence. Rather than presenting definitive
conclusions, our results aim to catalyze the discussion on the use of students
in experiments and pave the way for future investigations. Specifically, our
results encourage us to examine the complex factors influencing SE tasks,
making experiments as more realistic as possible.

### [406] [Understanding API Usage and Testing: An Empirical Study of C Libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11598)
*Ahmed Zaki,Cristian Cadar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores API usage vs. testing in 21 popular C libraries, highlighting the gaps in library testing. The authors developed 'LibProbe,' a framework for this analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help library developers make data-driven decisions on bugs, features, and testing based on how APIs are used in real-world applications.

Method: Analyzed API usage from 3,061 C/C++ clients of 21 libraries and compared this with how the libraries' test suites cover those APIs, using the LibProbe framework.

Result: Found that API testing often does not align with real-world API usage, as seen in LMDB, where 45% of APIs used by clients went untested. Leveraging client test suites increased LMDB test coverage by 14.7%.

Conclusion: Library test coverage could be improved by considering client usage patterns, which can help build more representative tests and enhance reliability.

Abstract: For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients
are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug
reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of
a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API
is used.
  In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage
across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a
combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how
well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for
library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API
usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that
library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use
their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a
popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by
the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be
leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7%
with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the
APIs are used in the field.
  For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be
used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce
various metrics useful to library developers.

### [407] [Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614)
*Yonggang Tao,Jingling Xue*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMA, improving delta debugging's efficiency by probabilistically assessing and excluding non-failure-inducing subsets, reducing redundant tests and processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in delta debugging when the assumption of monotonicity does not always hold, leading to redundant tests and slower debugging processes.

Method: The paper proposes Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), which dynamically models monotonicity using prior test results and a confidence function to optimize the debugging process.

Result: PMA reduces processing time by 59.2% against CHISEL and 22.0% against ProbDD, speeds up the reduction process, and decreases final reduced program sizes compared to both tools.

Conclusion: PMA significantly enhances delta debugging efficiency and effectiveness by optimizing test processes and maintaining or improving reduction quality.

Abstract: Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a
failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure,
permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However,
this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces
Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of
DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically
models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried
during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify
monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of
non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant
tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of
the reduction.
  We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD.
Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to
CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted
per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by
6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x
speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final
reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly
improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its
effectiveness.

### [408] [An Empirical study on LLM-based Log Retrieval for Software Engineering Metadata Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11659)
*Simin Sun,Yuchuan Jin,Miroslaw Staron*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-supported approach to simplify querying and retrieval of autonomous driving test logs, supplemented with video data, enabling natural language searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems generate extensive logs that are difficult to query due to signal complexity and developer unfamiliarity.

Method: The paper integrates LLMs with signal log and video data, using scenario graphs and gap indicators for search reliability and implements an API for querying and visualization.

Result: Evaluation on an industrial dataset showed enhanced efficiency and reliability in retrieving driving scenarios without relying solely on SQL-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system streamlines scenario search through natural language queries and multi-source integration, addressing usability and accuracy challenges.

Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing
extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification,
research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over
varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific
driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals
representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as
unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals.
Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both
domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are
difficult to verify for accuracy.
  This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that
combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling
natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap
indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of
query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database
querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for
intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates
improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating
dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.

*Yiwei Hu,Zhen Li,Kedie Shu,Shenghua Guan,Deqing Zou,Shouhuai Xu,Bin Yuan,Hai Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) methods, provides a systematization framework, evaluates tools for C/C++ and Java programs, and introduces a benchmark dataset, Vul4C, featuring 144 vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The steadily growing complexity of software is leading to increased vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for efficient solutions beyond manual repairs, such as AVR.

Method: The authors examined the AVR workflow, constructed a benchmark dataset (Vul4C) for C/C++ programs, and evaluated AVR tools for both C/C++ and Java programs using Vul4C and Vul4J datasets.

Result: The paper created the Vul4C dataset for C/C++ programs, evaluated seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs, and assessed two tools for Java programs, highlighting disparities in evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of standardized benchmarks like Vul4C for advancing AVR research, provides insights into tool efficacy, and outlines directions for future research to optimize vulnerability repair.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software has led to the steady growth of
vulnerabilities. Vulnerability repair investigates how to fix software
vulnerabilities. Manual vulnerability repair is labor-intensive and
time-consuming because it relies on human experts, highlighting the importance
of Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR). In this SoK, we present the
systematization of AVR methods through the three steps of AVR workflow:
vulnerability analysis, patch generation, and patch validation. We assess AVR
tools for C/C++ and Java programs as they have been widely studied by the
community. Since existing AVR tools for C/C++ programs are evaluated with
different datasets, which often consist of a few vulnerabilities, we construct
the first C/C++ vulnerability repair benchmark dataset, dubbed Vul4C, which
contains 144 vulnerabilities as well as their exploits and patches. We use
Vul4C to evaluate seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs and use the third-party
Vul4J dataset to evaluate two AVR tools for Java programs. We also discuss
future research directions.

### [410] [Classification of Quality Characteristics in Online User Feedback using Linguistic Analysis, Crowdsourcing and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11722)
*Eduard C. Groen,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Martijn van Vliet,Boris Winter,Joerg Doerr,Sjaak Brinkkemper*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three approaches—language patterns, crowdsourcing, and large language models (LLMs)—for identifying software quality characteristics in user feedback, particularly in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automating the identification of software quality characteristics from heterogeneous and limited user feedback data.

Method: The study tested three methods: language patterns with quality-related keywords, crowdsourced micro-task instructions, and LLM-based prompts, and compared their classification accuracy.

Result: Crowdsourcing achieved the highest average accuracy (up to 0.72). LLM-based approaches performed comparably (up to 0.68) but demonstrated potential alongside crowdsourcing, while the LP-based approach had lower precision and limited recall.

Conclusion: Crowdsourcing and LLM-based approaches are promising for accurately classifying quality characteristics in low-data settings, potentially enabling the development of training corpora, whereas the LP-based approach showed limited effectiveness.

Abstract: Software qualities such as usability or reliability are among the strongest
determinants of mobile app user satisfaction and constitute a significant
portion of online user feedback on software products, making it a valuable
source of quality-related feedback to guide the development process. The
abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of
quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the
lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised
machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches
that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on
quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large
language model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach
and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of
quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision
(0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall;
crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases
(0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition
(0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings
show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing
or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while
the LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing
and LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in translating natural language software requirements into formal specifications.

Method: The authors conducted a focused literature review using academic databases and employed an AI-assisted tool, Elicit, for paper selection, followed by manual screening.

Result: The survey reviews 35 relevant studies, provides insights into LLM-based formalization approaches, and examples for languages like Dafny, C, and Java.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the utility of LLMs in formal specification processes and suggest future research directions to enhance their application.

Abstract: This paper presents a focused literature survey on the use of large language
models (LLM) to assist in writing formal specifications for software. A summary
of thirty-five key papers is presented, including examples for specifying
programs written in Dafny, C and Java. This paper arose from the project
VERIFAI - Traceability and verification of natural language requirements that
addresses the challenges in writing formal specifications from requirements
that are expressed in natural language. Our methodology employed multiple
academic databases to identify relevant research. The AI-assisted tool Elicit
facilitated the initial paper selection, which were manually screened for final
selection. The survey provides valuable insights and future directions for
utilising LLMs while formalising software requirements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines claims that LLMs outperform humans in competitive programming, using a benchmark updated to minimize data contamination and detailed analysis by Olympiad medalists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the claim that LLMs outperform elite human programmers and highlight limitations in nuances of algorithmic reasoning.

Method: Develop LiveCodeBench Pro benchmark with annotated problems and perform line-by-line analysis of model failures by expert programmers.

Result: Models achieve 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, showing weaknesses in complex reasoning tasks and reliance on implementation precision.

Conclusion: LLMs are far from matching human grandmaster performance in competitive programming, with critical gaps highlighted for guiding future improvements in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

*Xingyu Liu,Yubin Li,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study proposes a generative model to uncover a compact, low-dimensional blueprint guiding brain development, analyzing connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the low-dimensional blueprint that enables the brain's complex structure to arise despite genetic information storage limitations.

Method: A generative model was introduced to learn underlying representations from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits, compressing information into a latent space.

Result: The model successfully captures structural information in a compressed latent space, revealing interpretable directions linked to network properties and enabling the generation of synthetic microcircuits.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into neural circuit design principles and establishes a method for replicating desired structural features, contributing to brain function understanding and advanced AI development.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: SAE-BrainMap aligns deep learning visual model representations with fMRI responses using sparse autoencoders, showcasing high correspondence and hierarchical mapping between neural layers and the human visual cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly align deep learning visual model activations with voxel-level fMRI responses and understand the functional mapping between artificial and human visual processing.

Method: Sparse autoencoders were trained on model activations, correlations were calculated to match SAE activations with fMRI signals, and a voxel dictionary was created for mapping. Cortical visualization and hierarchical mapping analyses were performed.

Result: Strong activation correspondence (up to 0.76 cosine similarity) was observed, SAE units preserved functional ROIs, and fine-grained mappings of visual pathways and cortical activations highlighted model interpretability.

Conclusion: The study provides a downstream-task-free connection between deep visual models and human visual cortex, offering insights into how models and brains process visual information.

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a convolution-based data assimilation method for better alignment in neuronal electrophysiology by focusing on spike timing precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional value-based synchronization methods do not adequately address spike timing precision, which is critical for neural signal analysis.

Method: A Gaussian convolution is applied to measured data and model estimates, generating a cost function based on amplitude and timing alignment via spike overlap.

Result: Experiments with both synthetic and real hippocampal neuron recordings show improved parameter estimation and prediction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the ability to capture sharp, time-sensitive neuronal dynamics with increased precision compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: We present a convolution-based data assimilation method tailored to neuronal
electrophysiology, addressing the limitations of traditional value-based
synchronization approaches. While conventional methods rely on nudging terms
and pointwise deviation metrics, they often fail to account for spike timing
precision, a key feature in neural signals. Our approach applies a Gaussian
convolution to both measured data and model estimates, enabling a cost function
that evaluates both amplitude and timing alignment via spike overlap. This
formulation remains compatible with gradient-based optimization. Through twin
experiments and real hippocampal neuron recordings, we demonstrate improved
parameter estimation and prediction quality, particularly in capturing sharp,
time-sensitive dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Swin Transformer-based method to predict future brain states using fMRI data with high accuracy, potentially advancing brain-computer interfaces and reducing fMRI scan times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health, and fMRI provides a way to measure these dynamics through BOLD signals representing brain states.

Method: The authors developed a model with a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as an encoder to capture spatio-temporal features and a convolutional decoder to predict future brain states at high spatial and temporal resolution.

Result: The model was trained and tested on 100 subjects' data from the Human Connectome Project and demonstrated high accuracy in predicting resting-state brain activities for 7.2 seconds into the future, based on prior 23.04-second fMRI data.

Conclusion: The study shows that Swin Transformer models effectively learn the spatiotemporal organization of the brain, which could significantly enhance the efficiency of fMRI and enable the development of brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Neurovascular coupling (NVC) was studied in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients using rsEEG and fNIRS, uncovering differences in neural-hemodynamic responses across acute, recovery, and healthy phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding neurovascular coupling alterations in MDD patients could offer insights into the pathophysiology and recovery process, potentially identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.

Method: Simultaneous rsEEG and fNIRS were used to measure neural and hemodynamic signals in MDD patients and healthy controls during resting-state conditions, focusing on coherence and temporal delays in the prefrontal cortex.

Result: Patients in the maintenance phase show higher neural-hemodynamic correlation, while healthy individuals exhibit faster recovery dynamics. Recovery in neurovascular coupling progresses from acute to remission phases.

Conclusion: Wearable neuroimaging revealed specific NVC changes in MDD patients and potential biomarkers for depression and recovery through unique neural-hemodynamic coupling patterns.

Abstract: Neurovascular coupling (NVC) refers to the process by which local neural
activity, through energy consumption, induces changes in regional cerebral
blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of neurons. Event-related studies have
shown that the hemodynamic response typically lags behind neural activation by
4-6 seconds. However, little is known about how NVC is altered in patients with
major depressive disorder (MDD) and throughout the recovery process. In this
study, we employed simultaneous resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG)
and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor neural and
hemodynamic signals. Twelve patients with MDD during the acute phase, ten
patients in the maintenance or consolidation phase, and six healthy controls
were involved. We calculated the differences in coherence and temporal delay
between spontaneous peak electrophysiological activity and hemodynamic
responses across groups during the resting state in the prefrontal cortex
(PFC). We found that the neural activity and its subsequent correlation with
hemodynamic responses were significantly higher in patients during the
maintenance phase. The rise time from the lowest to the highest point of
correlation was shorter in healthy individuals than in patients in the acute
phase, and gradually recovered during remission. By leveraging wearable
neuroimaging techniques, this study reveals alterations in neurovascular
coupling in depression and offers novel multimodal insights into potential
biomarkers for MDD and its recovery process.

*Ahmed Farooq*

TL;DR: The paper proposes an energy functional resembling Modern Hopfield Networks (MNH), linking it to attention mechanisms in transformer models, and suggests enhancements for sequence modeling with non-linear attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transformer-based models' understanding of complex relationships, representation learning, and performance through the introduction of non-linear mechanisms.

Method: Defining an energy functional with stationary points tied to attention computation, creating energy landscapes where gradients reflect attentions, and proposing non-linear attention heads in transformers.

Result: Unified framework connecting Modern Hopfield Networks and attention computation. "Context wells" encode token contextual relationships, improving model efficiency and performance for sequence tasks.

Conclusion: Non-linear attention mechanisms enhance transformer models' effectiveness in sequence modeling by capturing richer contextual relationships and offering improved understanding and efficiency.

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI has highlighted the need for selecting optimal datasets to improve machine learning models, but certain aspects of this remain insufficiently explored.

Method: A practical algorithm based on an oracle inequality and data-driven estimators was proposed to identify and merge datasets that minimize population loss with high probability.

Result: The algorithm showed effectiveness in experiments involving standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides a theoretically backed, practical solution for enhancing predictive performance by optimal dataset selection and merging from different sources.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of
selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored,
even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of
developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize
population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly
speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing expensive objective functions in networks that involve cost variances and independent evaluations is critical for applications like manufacturing and drug discovery.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a global Monte Carlo simulation to generate node-specific candidate inputs, reducing computational overhead compared to nested simulations used in the original p-KGFN.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that the accelerated algorithm achieves up to a 16x speedup while preserving query efficiency comparable to the original method.

Conclusion: The accelerated p-KGFN offers a more computationally efficient approach to cost-aware optimization of function networks, making it suitable for applications requiring faster evaluations without compromising effectiveness.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

*Chloe H. Choi,Andrea Zanoni,Daniele E. Schiavazzi,Alison L. Marsden*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve Bayesian parameter estimation in cardiovascular modeling by reducing computational costs using low-fidelity approximations and validating various surrogate-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations in cardiovascular modeling, especially for Bayesian parameter estimation.

Method: The paper explores five methods leveraging low-fidelity models: using surrogate models for high-fidelity simulations, modeling discrepancies with neural networks or dimensionality reduction techniques, and treating discrepancy as noise using normalizing flows to modify the likelihood function.

Result: Five methods were validated on analytical test cases and two cardiovascular models—a Windkessel model and a patient-specific anatomy—to assess both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The approaches successfully demonstrated reduced computational costs while maintaining accuracy, offering practical alternatives for Bayesian inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

*Jichuan Tang,Patrick T. Brewick,Ryan G. McClarren,Christopher Sweet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes the FExD, a novel variant of DeepONets, for superior spatial-temporal surrogate modeling to address challenges in structural dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-temporal modeling in civil infrastructure is essential but remains challenging for high temporal-spatial resolution prediction.

Method: The study introduces the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), which enhances branch and trunk networks for better learning and predictive ability.

Result: FExD outperforms vanilla DeepONet and modified spatio-temporal DeepONets in accuracy and computational efficiency on bridge dynamics.

Conclusion: FExD demonstrates significant promise in operator learning for complex structural dynamics, paving the way for advanced predictive modeling.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

*Hwanwoo Kim,Chong Liu,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the effect of inexact maximizers on Bayesian optimization (BO) and demonstrates how sublinear cumulative regret can still be achieved without exact acquisition function maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenges in maximizing acquisition functions for BO, particularly when exact solutions are costly or impractical.

Method: Analyzed the impact of inexact acquisition maximization using cumulative regret bounds for GP-UCB and GP-TS, and validated with theoretical and numerical approaches.

Result: Showed that sublinear cumulative regret is possible under conditions of controlled inaccuracy in acquisition solutions.

Conclusion: Inexact acquisition function solvers, such as random grid search, can be theoretically and practically effective for Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

*Zhenisbek Assylbekov,Alan Legg,Artur Pak*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the fast convergence of the EM algorithm in overspecified Gaussian mixture models, demonstrating logarithmic iteration rates and providing both theoretical and experimental evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the performance and convergence behavior of the EM algorithm in Gaussian mixture models where the number of components exceeds the true underlying distribution, addressing initialization and clustering challenges in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The authors leverage strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood and the Polyak-Łojasiewicz inequality to study convergence, providing exponential guarantees for population-level EM and extending the analysis to finite-sample scenarios.

Result: Exponential convergence in terms of KL distance for population EM is achieved with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, supported by statistical guarantees and synthetic experiments showing faster convergence compared to traditional rates.

Conclusion: This study deepens understanding of EM's behavior in overspecified models, offering practical insights into initialization and model design in clustering and density estimation, with significant acceleration in convergence rates.

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

### [425] [How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869)
*Michela Lapenna,Caterina De Bacco*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper compares Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in their effectiveness on link prediction tasks, focusing on input features, robustness to noise, graph heterophily, computational complexity, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphs often represent complex real-world systems. The study aims to understand how PGMs and GNNs handle graph-structured data differently for network-related tasks like link prediction.

Method: Three experiments were conducted using synthetic and real networks: analyzing handling of input features, robustness to noisy data, and performance in graphs with increasing heterophily.

Result: PGMs perform better than GNNs on graphs with low-dimensional or noisy node features, and are more robust to graph heterophily. PGMs also show advantages in interpretability and potentially lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: PGMs are more suitable for scenarios involving noisy or low-dimensional features and heterophilic graphs, offering advantages in robustness, simplicity, and interpretability over GNNs.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

*Siavash Ameli,Chris van der Heide,Liam Hodgkinson,Michael W. Mahoney*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to estimate the eigenspectrum of massive matrices that are inaccessible in explicit form, using properties from free probability theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large matrices, especially covariance and kernel matrices, have critical roles in machine learning but are often inaccessible or impractical to compute in their entirety due to data scale constraints.

Method: The authors propose "free decompression," leveraging free probability theory to extrapolate the spectral properties of large matrices by observing small submatrices.

Result: The method demonstrates high accuracy in estimating the eigenspectra of large matrices, as validated using synthetic examples and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Free decompression provides a novel and effective approach for handling impalpable matrices, offering potential advances in distributed learning and large-scale spectral computations.

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

*Zhen Qian,Sebastian Bathiany,Teng Liu,Lana L. Blaschke,Hoong Chen Teo,Niklas Boers*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The study examines aboveground carbon (AGC) stock and flux dynamics in global forests from 1988 to 2021, revealing significant regional sink-to-source transitions, particularly in tropical forests, using satellite data and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties in global forest AGC dynamics and sink-source transitions caused by variable disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in observational and analytical methods.

Method: The study integrates multi-source satellite data with probabilistic deep learning models to estimate reliable, harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes at high spatial resolution, while also accounting for uncertainties.

Result: Global forests were AGC sinks over three decades, but moist tropical and boreal forests became AGC sources in recent periods. Regional trends vary, with strong sink-to-source transitions, especially in tropical forests and regions like Europe and Australia becoming AGC sources post-2011.

Conclusion: Tropical forests increasingly influence terrestrial carbon cycle variability, with anthropogenic climate change significantly affecting AGC dynamics, notably in previously untouched areas.

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RecFound, a framework for recommendation foundation models that addresses gaps in embedding tasks and multi-task learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current recommendation foundation models, such as neglect of embedding tasks and inefficiencies in multi-task learning.

Method: The authors propose RecFound with three main components: TMoLE for knowledge sharing and conflict resolution, S2Sched for convergence consistency, and Model Merge to balance performance.

Result: RecFound demonstrates state-of-the-art results across various recommendation tasks, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: RecFound effectively resolves the limitations of embedding tasks and multi-task learning in recommendation foundation models, providing superior performance.

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes strategies to reduce inference latency and increase throughput in real-time recommendation systems while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the computational and resource challenges of deep learning models in real-time settings for recommendation systems.

Method: Lightweight network design, structured pruning, weight quantization, integration of heterogeneous compute platforms, elastic inference scheduling, and load-balancing mechanisms.

Result: System latency reduced to less than 30% of baseline and system throughput more than doubled, all while maintaining recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: The presented methods provide a practical and efficient solution for scaling online recommendation systems.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GraphRAG-Causal develops a system that combines graph-based retrieval with large language models to improve causal reasoning in news contexts, using causal knowledge graphs and achieving an 82.1% F1-score in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods often fail to identify complex causal links in news analysis, especially in low-data scenarios. This paper aims to enhance causal reasoning capabilities to address these limitations.

Method: The approach uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) Data preparation converts news sentences into annotated causal graphs; (2) Graph retrieval employs Neo4j and hybrid Cypher queries to store and match these graphs; (3) LLM inference uses XML-prompting with retrieved graphs for few-shot learning in causal relationship classification.

Result: GraphRAG-Causal achieved an F1-score of 82.1% in causal classification tasks using only 20 few-shot examples, showcasing its effectiveness in extracting and reasoning about causal relationships.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves accuracy and consistency in analyzing causal links, making it valuable for applications like misinformation detection, news reliability, and policy analysis.

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

TL;DR: Generative AI tools might hinder human memory and expertise development by bypassing necessary learning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how increasing reliance on AI systems affects the consolidation of critical cognitive functions.

Method: The paper analyzes AI impact on human memory systems, drawing comparisons between cognitive neuroscience and deep learning phenomena.

Result: Empirical studies reveal AI reliance can obstruct procedural memory development, limiting intuitive mastery and schema-building.

Conclusion: Strong internal cognitive models are vital for effective human-AI collaboration, with policy implications for education and training.

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for healthcare organizations to develop their own foundation AI models rather than depend on commercial ones, citing benefits in performance, governance, competitive advantage, and innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address healthcare-specific requirements and challenges such as domain-specific data, governance policies, and innovation demands.

Method: The study uses empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and case studies to analyze the value of proprietary multimodal foundation models in addressing healthcare needs.

Result: Proprietary AI models in healthcare showed better clinical outcomes, quicker innovation cycles, improved data governance, and stronger strategic standing.

Conclusion: The authors argue that developing proprietary foundation models is essential for healthcare organizations to thrive and adapt in a competitive, innovation-driven landscape.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study surveyed AI researchers and the public on subjective AI, finding wide-ranging uncertainty and disagreement but concern over timely governance and ethical safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the views of AI researchers and the general public on the likelihood of creating AI systems with subjective experience and their governance.

Method: Surveyed 582 prolific AI researchers and 838 US participants on the probability, ethics, and governance of AI systems with subjective experiences.

Result: Responses varied, with the public more skeptical of subjective AI than researchers. Both groups acknowledged the need for governance but were divided on ethics and rights.

Conclusion: Both groups agree on the need for safeguards against risks associated with AI with subjective experience but differ on timeline expectations and governance specifics.

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

### [434] [Deep Symmetric Autoencoders from the Eckart-Young-Schmidt Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11641)
*Simone Brivio,Nicola Rares Franco*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper analyzes symmetric autoencoders, a class of deep learning networks, and introduces a mathematical framework to understand their strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of deep autoencoders, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of their expressiveness and limitations, motivating a need for a rigorous analysis.

Method: The authors mathematically analyze symmetric autoencoders, differentiate between symmetric architectures, and leverage the Eckart-Young-Schmidt theorem to understand reconstruction errors. They also propose the EYS initialization strategy using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Result: Numerical experiments validate the proposed EYS initialization strategy, benchmarking it against conventional autoencoders and highlighting its importance in model design and initialization.

Conclusion: The study provides a solid mathematical foundation for symmetric autoencoders, offering insights into their performance and practical strategies for improvement.

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

*Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Zakhar Shumaylov*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven paradigm for solving inverse problems, leveraging models like deep learning for improved accuracy and efficiency, alongside classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are crucial to many scientific fields, allowing insights into otherwise hidden structures, yet are often ill-posed and challenging to solve robustly.

Method: The paper first introduces classical approaches for solving inverse problems and then explores modern data-driven methods, focusing on adversarial regularization and linear plug-and-play denoisers.

Result: The presented methodologies demonstrate enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency in solving inverse problems, supported by theoretical validation and numerical examples.

Conclusion: Data-driven approaches, particularly modern machine learning paradigms, provide promising pathways for addressing inverse problems, with future research directions and challenges outlined.

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical
quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

### [436] [Equivalence of stationary dynamical solutions in a directed chain and a Delay Differential Equation of neuroscientific relevance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11654)
*Giulio Colombini,Nicola Guglielmi,Armando Bazzani*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: The paper investigates the emergence of stationary dynamical states in directed networks, using excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons on a single cycle, and identifies a self-sustained traveling wave through saddle-point bifurcation of limit cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stationary dynamical states arise in directed networks, contrasting with the typical synchronized states seen in undirected networks, particularly in the context of information spreading dynamics.

Method: The authors conduct a numerical study of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons on a directed cycle and develop an effective Delay Differential Equation (DDE) model to describe the system behavior, including bifurcations and traveling wave dynamics.

Result: The study demonstrates a self-sustained traveling wave that emerges via saddle-point bifurcation, which does not destabilize the system's global fixed point. The DDE model effectively maps stationary solutions and replicates bifurcation phenomena.

Conclusion: The discrete structure of the directed cycle is found to induce coordinated states, and the DDE model accurately preserves these features. Scaling behavior suggests a solitonic nature of wave states for large cycles.

Abstract: While synchronized states, and the dynamical pathways through which they
emerge, are often regarded as the paradigm to understand the dynamics of
information spreading on undirected networks of nonlinear dynamical systems,
when we consider directed network architectures, dynamical stationary states
can arise. To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network,
a single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show
numerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a
self-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit
cycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then
formulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in
terms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an
explicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of
mapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is
shown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not
destabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in
general between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed
as the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of
solutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature
accurately. Finally, the scaling of the inter-site propagation times hints to a
solitonic nature of the wave state in the limit of large chain size.

### [437] [Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796)
*Elias Najarro,Nicolas Bessone,Sebastian Risi*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel inverse modeling method to identify unknown causal parameters in self-organizing systems characterized by stochastic patterns, using visual embeddings to handle variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding self-organizing systems, commonly observed in natural processes, is challenging due to their stochastic and diverse yet equivalent patterns. The work addresses the gap in traditional methods which fail to capture feature similarities in such scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a method that leverages visual embedding spaces to create invariant representations of patterns, bypassing the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics to recover parameters under stochastic conditions.

Result: The method successfully recovers parameters in two case studies—a reaction-diffusion model and an agent-based social segregation model—despite high stochasticity. It also performs well in analyzing real biological patterns.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates robustness and versatility by reliably solving the inverse problem in stochastic systems, suggesting its utility for both theoretical and experimental research in complex pattern formation.

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces DYNAMO, a novel method to uncover time-varying causes behind home field advantage in sports, validated through simulations and application to English Premier League data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenge of identifying the causes of home field advantage in sports within non-stationary, time-varying environments, which has been difficult with existing methods.

Method: The authors propose DYNAMO, a causal discovery method using dynamic non-stationary M-estimators to uncover time-varying causal structures. The approach is flexible, supports linear and non-linear processes, and provides theoretical guarantees for identifiability and consistency.

Result: Simulation studies confirm DYNAMO’s effectiveness in extracting time-varying causal structures. Applying DYNAMO to English Premier League data reveals team-specific field advantages influenced by referee bias, varying with crowd presence, and improves goal prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: DYNAMO successfully uncovers complex, time-varying causal structures in non-stationary environments, offering meaningful insights into home field advantage and outperforming existing methods in prediction tasks.

Abstract: In sports analytics, home field advantage is a robust phenomenon where the
home team wins more games than the away team. However, discovering the causal
factors behind home field advantage presents unique challenges due to the
non-stationary, time-varying environment of sports matches. In response, we
propose a novel causal discovery method, DYnamic Non-stAtionary local
M-estimatOrs (DYNAMO), to learn the time-varying causal structures of home
field advantage. DYNAMO offers flexibility by integrating various loss
functions, making it practical for learning linear and non-linear causal
structures from a general class of non-stationary causal processes. By
leveraging local information, we provide theoretical guarantees for the
identifiability and estimation consistency of non-stationary causal structures
without imposing additional assumptions. Simulation studies validate the
efficacy of DYNAMO in recovering time-varying causal structures. We apply our
method to high-resolution event data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 English
Premier League seasons, during which the former season had no audience
presence. Our results reveal intriguing, time-varying, team-specific field
advantages influenced by referee bias, which differ significantly with and
without crowd support. Furthermore, the time-varying causal structures learned
by our method improve goal prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.

*Mohammadamin Moradi,Runyu Jiang,Yingzi Liu,Malvern Madondo,Tianming Wu,James J. Sohn,Xiaofeng Yang,Yasmin Hasan,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study develops a fully automated high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment planning framework using reinforcement learning (RL) and dose-based optimization, achieving higher consistency and efficiency compared to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR brachytherapy for advanced cervical cancer is highly effective but relies heavily on manual expertise, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies in treatment planning.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage autoplanning framework. First, a reinforcement learning agent (DQN) selects treatment parameters by balancing target coverage with organ-at-risk sparing. Then, an Adam-based optimizer computes the dwell time distribution based on these parameters.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated clinically meaningful parameter adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. Test results showed an average performance score of 93.89%, surpassing clinical manual planning (91.86%) while maintaining target coverage and minimizing hot spots.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework effectively automates HDR brachytherapy planning, aligning with clinical objectives and offering improved consistency, efficiency, and treatment quality.

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

Motivation: To address the growing need for flexible and efficient Earth Observation (EO) using Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) and advancements in onboard satellite computing.

Method: Developing a constructive heuristic method, integrated with Local Search (LS) strategy, that accounts for onboard data processing in multi-satellite optimization.

Result: The algorithm improves frame resolution by 10% on average, reduces target monitoring variance by 83%, and delivers more up-to-date information compared to FIFO scheduling.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods by providing higher-quality data and better information distribution in agile satellite scheduling.

Abstract: The emergence of Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) has marked a
significant turning point in the field of Earth Observation (EO), offering
enhanced flexibility in data acquisition. Concurrently, advancements in onboard
satellite computing and communication technologies have greatly enhanced data
compression efficiency, reducing network latency and congestion while

Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP), which involves
determining the optimal sequence of target observations to maximize overall

real-time remote monitoring into the multi-satellite optimization problem. To
this end, we define a set of priority indicators and develop a constructive
heuristic method, further enhanced with a Local Search (LS) strategy. The
results show that the proposed algorithm provides high-quality information by
increasing the resolution of the collected frames by up to 10% on average,
while reducing the variance in the monitoring frequency of the targets within
the instance by up to 83%, ensuring more up-to-date information across the
entire set compared to a First-In First-Out (FIFO) method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hardware-efficient DNN optimized for encrypted session-level traffic classification on IoT and edge devices via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing encrypted internet traffic on IoT devices while adhering to stringent hardware constraints.

Method: The study employs hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to tailor a 1D CNN for the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset, focusing on minimizing memory and computational requirements while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The optimized model achieves 96.59% accuracy with significant reductions in parameters, FLOPs, and tensor size, outperforming state-of-the-art models up to 444-fold in efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach provides scalable and efficient cybersecurity solutions for real-time encrypted traffic analysis on resource-limited IoT networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized
through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports
the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict
memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The
optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,
10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art
models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in
these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and
runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of current web infrastructure in supporting autonomous AI agents and evaluates various approaches for improvement, including upgrades, switches, and hybrids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web infrastructure is designed for human-scale interactions and struggles to meet the needs of autonomous AI agents that require ultra-fast discovery, credential management, and scalability.

Method: The authors identify failure points in the current infrastructure, analyze qualitative changes required, and evaluate three potential approaches: upgrading, switching, and hybrid solutions.

Result: The analysis shows that clean-slate solutions outperform upgraded systems in performance but take longer for adoption. Hybrid approaches seem most viable, balancing centralized registries and federated meshes.

Conclusion: Transitioning toward infrastructure suited for autonomous AI agents demands qualitative shifts, likely resulting in hybrid architectures combining centralized and federated systems to meet varied agent requirements.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective CRISPR-Cas12 genome editing demands accurate gRNA activity prediction, but this is challenging due to limited data, PAM-specific variations, and reliance on large-scale customized training.

Method: The study inputs embeddings from a pre-trained RNA foundation model (originally trained on transcriptomic data) into a lightweight regression model, and integrates chromatin accessibility data to improve predictions.

Result: The method achieves substantial performance improvements over traditional baseline approaches for gRNA activity prediction.

Conclusion: Pre-trained RNA foundation models, paired with chromatin accessibility data, are effective tools for enhancing the prediction of gRNA activity.

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12
genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across
protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer model, analyzes spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to uncover cell microenvironment influences and achieve state-of-the-art results in clinical predictions and cell characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial transcriptomics models fail to incorporate spatial resolution or hierarchical gene regulation, despite the importance of microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior.

Method: HEIST models tissues as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs and cells as gene regulatory networks, using a hierarchical graph transformer for cross-level and within-level message passing. It leverages contrastive learning and auto-encoding objectives for pre-training on large datasets.

Result: HEIST uncovers spatially-informed cellular subpopulations missed by prior models and outperforms competitors in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed clustering.

Conclusion: HEIST underscores the significance of hierarchical representations in spatial transcriptomics, providing valuable insights into cellular microenvironments and advancing capabilities in biological data analysis.

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that non-local and non-linear INR-based techniques can effectively model spatial gene expression in the human brain.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in
non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms,
specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool
for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray
gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce
fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a
voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes,
whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen
Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so
that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from
Abagen as a baseline/reference.

*Roxana Zahedi,Ahmadreza Argha,Nona Farbehi,Ivan Bakhshayeshi,Youqiong Ye,Nigel H. Lovell,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: A deep learning framework, SemanticST, enhances spatial transcriptomics analysis by creating biologically informed, context-specific multigraphs and scalable embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data struggle with noise, scalability, and accurately modeling complex cellular relationships.

Method: SemanticST constructs multiple context-specific graphs (spatial, gene expression, and tissue domain-based) and fuses embeddings using an attention-inspired strategy, paired with a community-aware min-cut loss for robustness.

Result: SemanticST outperformed existing methods (DeepST, GraphST, IRIS) in scalability and metrics like ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity, while discovering rare biologically significant clusters in breast cancer Xenium data.

Conclusion: SemanticST offers a powerful, scalable, and biologically insightful tool for spatial transcriptomics, contributing to tissue atlases, disease understanding, and precision medicine.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

*Lehu Bu,Zhaohan Yu,Shaoting Lin,Jan N. Fuhg,Jin Yang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC) combined with machine learning to quickly and accurately characterize the mechanical properties of soft biological materials under extreme strain rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rheological tools struggle to measure material mechanics at extremely high strain rates due to limitations in speed, resolution, or invasiveness. This gap hinders the study of biological materials within these challenging regimes.

Method: The method uses ultra-high-speed imaging to monitor bubble radius dynamics during LIC events. These measurements are analyzed using a novel machine learning model called Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), trained on physics-based simulations to infer material viscoelastic parameters accurately.

Result: The Bubble Dynamics Transformer eliminates the need for iterative fitting or complex calculations, providing fast, precise, and non-invasive characterization of soft materials.

Conclusion: This framework represents a significant advancement for studying soft material mechanics under ultra-high strain rates, with broad potential for biomedical and material science applications.

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

*Mae Younes,Adnane Boukhayma*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AA-2DGS, an antialiased version of 2D Gaussian Splatting that reduces rendering artifacts during camera zoom or field of view changes, improving its practical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) provides good view-consistency and geometric accuracy but suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling rates, which limits its use in applications requiring variable zoom or fields of view.

Method: The authors propose a world-space smoothing kernel to constrain frequency content based on training views' maximal sampling frequency and a novel object-space Mip filter that applies efficient anti-aliasing in local splat space using an affine approximation.

Result: AA-2DGS achieves improved rendering quality across scales while maintaining the geometric accuracy of 2DGS, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts during zooming.

Conclusion: The improvements in AA-2DGS enhance the practical applicability of 2DGS for scenarios with varying camera zoom or fields of view, offering high-quality rendering and retaining geometric benefits.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Motivation: The perception of synthetic content and modern rendering distortions is underexplored in comparison to natural videos and traditional distortions.

Method: The authors present a novel dataset capturing distortions from advanced rendering techniques and propose CGVQM, a full-reference video quality metric.

Result: CGVQM significantly outperforms existing metrics with improved alignment with human perception, delivering per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Conclusion: CGVQM enhances the evaluation of video quality for synthetic content, with higher accuracy compared to existing metrics. The dataset and metric are publicly available.

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

trends. With a well-designed prompt and the LLaMA-2-13B-Chat-GPTQ model, it
runs completely offline and allows the agents undergo self-improvement through
100 rounds of communication with less human interaction. A scoring function is
incorporated to evaluate agent's performance, providing visual plots to track
learning progress. This work demonstrates the potential of AutoGen-style agents
for autonomous, scalable, and iterative analysis in social science domains
maintaining data privacy through offline execution.

*Jianhong Wang,Yang Li,Samuel Kaski,Jonathan Lawry*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel RL approach, Shapley Machine, for open multi-agent systems under n-agent ad hoc teamwork, leveraging cooperative game theory and dynamic Shapley value calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address theoretical limitations and ambiguous credit assignment in controlling agents in open multi-agent systems, particularly under n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT).

Method: The authors model NAHT using cooperative game theory and extend state and game space representations. They utilize Shapley values to allocate credit among controlled agents, proposing a TD(λ)-like RL algorithm called Shapley Machine.

Result: The experiments confirm the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and validate the proposed theoretical framework for NAHT.

Conclusion: Shapley Machine introduces a new intersection between cooperative game theory and RL for solving NAHT problems, ensuring theoretically sound credit assignments and effective control of agents.

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of anisotropy in pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT on keyword spotting in documentary linguistics, highlighting their robustness and effectiveness in identifying words without transcription.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of anisotropy in pretrained speech representations on downstream tasks, specifically in keyword spotting for computational documentary linguistics.

Method: The work uses Dynamic Time Warping to evaluate the effectiveness of wav2vec2's similarity measures in identifying words, despite their inherent anisotropy and without requiring transcription.

Result: The results show that wav2vec2 representations are robust and effectively capture phonetic structures, generalizing across speakers, even in the absence of transcription.

Conclusion: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 demonstrate strong robustness and utility in speech tasks, emphasizing the importance of pretraining for learning invariant and rich speech representations.

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the

TL;DR: GLAP enhances the CLAP framework with multilingual and multi-domain capabilities, demonstrating competitive and superior performance in various audio-text and speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLAP methods are limited to English, ignoring multilingual and multi-domain audio-text applications.

Method: GLAP extends CLAP by incorporating multilingual datasets and multi-domain audio-text training.

Result: GLAP outperforms existing methods in speech retrieval, classification, zero-shot sound-event benchmarks, and keyword spotting across 50 languages.

Conclusion: GLAP effectively bridges the gap between audio and text across multiple languages and domains, showcasing its potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

### [457] [(SimPhon Speech Test): A Data-Driven Method for In Silico Design and Validation of a Phonetically Balanced Speech Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11620)
*Stefan Bleeck*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test), a computational methodology to design speech perception tests that better diagnose speech deficits in hearing loss beyond audibility measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audiometry struggles to capture supra-threshold speech understanding deficits, especially in age-related hearing loss. The paper seeks to develop more specific diagnostic tools.

Method: The proposed methodology uses ASR systems to simulate hearing loss perception, analyzes phoneme confusion patterns under acoustic degradation, and curates optimized word pairs for testing through computational and expert validation.

Result: The optimized SimPhon Speech Test-25 set of 25 word pairs effectively assesses speech perception deficits and does not correlate with standard audibility measures like SII.

Conclusion: The SimPhon Speech Test provides a novel approach to diagnosing hearing loss-related speech deficits, offering a computationally efficient pipeline and readiness for human validation trials.

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to align and merge speech and music models into a unified audio model using a correlation-permutation approach, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merging separate models for speech and music without expensive pre-training presents challenges since the models are not usually aligned in the weight space.

Method: The correlation-permutation approach aligns the internal layers of a music encoder to a speech encoder layer by layer, using permutation matrices to maximize feature-wise cross-correlations, enabling effective model merging.

Result: The merged model maintained speech capabilities and boosted music performance, with a 14.83-point improvement over linear interpolation merging models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a computationally efficient method for creating unified audio models from independently trained encoders, paving the way for improved audio processing applications.

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOTA text-to-audio diffusion models lack granular, time-varying controls essential for music production, and current solutions like ControlNet are memory-intensive and limited to fixed controls.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight, modular architecture that fine-tunes the encoder of generative models with significantly fewer parameters, offering adaptable and independent controls for better efficiency.

Result: The proposed method reduces parameter count, enhances flexibility, matches ControlNet's audio quality, and minimizes memory usage, validated via objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient, flexible solution for text-to-audio diffusion models with superior adaptability and reduced computational burden.

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reliably transcribe child-centered daylong audio recordings using ASR by detecting transcribable utterances, achieving notable improvements in word error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rich linguistic analysis of longform child-centered audio recordings without the prohibitive manual annotation effort.

Method: Developing an approach to automatically identify reliably transcribable utterances within longform recordings, enabling the effective use of modern ASR systems.

Result: The method achieved a median WER of 0% and a mean WER of 18% for transcribing 13% of total speech, outperforming unfiltered transcription results, which exhibit a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%.

Conclusion: This approach significantly improves transcription accuracy for subsets of longform speech data, providing a pathway for scalable automated analyses of children’s language experiences.

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to synthesize abstract sounds by fusion using inversion techniques without prompt conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to develop a synthesis approach capable of producing abstract sounds that exhibit novel auditory features exceeding simple sound superposition.

Method: The paper proposes SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers to enable sound fusion with controllable synthesis and without reliance on prompt conditioning.

Result: The inversion models eliminate circular dependencies by restructuring model outputs as constants, simplifying the sound synthesis process.

Conclusion: The approach successfully synthesizes unique abstract sounds while allowing flexible guidance during sampling, advancing sound design methodologies.

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bidirectional AI system where dancers shape music through their movements, shifting the traditional role of AI in dance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional unidirectional link between music and dance limits creative possibilities, and existing AI applications in dance focus mostly on choreography generation. The paper seeks to redefine this dynamic for enriched artistic expression.

Method: The researchers created a multi-modal AI system that uses dancers' movements to shape pre-recorded musical clips into a coherent composition, building a bidirectional interaction.

Result: Performance data showed emergent communication between dancers’ movement qualities and generated audio features, highlighting effective interaction between the AI system and dancers.

Conclusion: This work reimagines AI as a responsive partner in performing arts, broadening creative opportunities for both professionals and amateurs to explore dance and music.

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

*Sadman Sadeed Omee,Lai Wei,Sourin Dey,Jianjun Hu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Crystalline materials can form varied polymorphs, influencing their physical properties. The presented ParetoCSP2 algorithm is a multi-objective genetic algorithm with enhanced adaptive features for accurate inorganic polymorph prediction, significantly outperforming existing CSP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current CSP methods for inorganic polymorph structures and enable better prediction accuracy and efficiency.

Method: ParetoCSP2 utilizes a multi-objective genetic algorithm incorporating adaptive space group diversity control, neural network interatomic potentials, improved population initialization, and iterative structure relaxation to prevent premature convergence and enhance prediction accuracy.

Result: ParetoCSP2 achieves near-perfect accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs with identical atom counts, outperforming baseline algorithms by 2.46-8.62 times and improving 44.8%-87.04% across key CSP performance metrics.

Conclusion: The ParetoCSP2 algorithm significantly advances predicting inorganic polymorph structures, enabling more reliable and faster CSP, contributing to material discovery and optimization.

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

### [464] [Coefficient Shape Transfer Learning for Functional Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11367)
*Shuhao Jiao,Ian W. Mckeague,N. -H. Chan*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transfer learning method for functional linear models, leveraging knowledge from auxiliary data sources to improve model estimation in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in functional linear models poses a critical challenge, necessitating effective methodologies to leverage related but heterogeneous auxiliary data sources.

Method: The method transfers shape-based knowledge from auxiliary (source) domains to the target domain via coefficient shape homogeneity, ensuring robustness to covariate scaling and enhancing the usability of diverse sources.

Result: Analysis reveals improvements in convergence rates and minimax optimality, contingent on coefficient similarities and spectral properties of functional covariates. A data-driven procedure is also developed to identify relevant auxiliary models.

Conclusion: The methodology achieves robust and effective model estimation, demonstrated through simulations and an application to physical activity data, overcoming traditional limitations of coefficient homogeneity.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning methodology to tackle the
challenge of data scarcity in functional linear models. The methodology
incorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from
auxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape
from the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based knowledge
transfer offers two key advantages. First, it is robust to covariate scaling,
ensuring effectiveness despite variations in data distributions across
different source domains. Second, the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity
represents a meaningful advance beyond traditional coefficient homogeneity,
allowing the method to exploit a wider range of source domains and achieve
significantly improved model estimation. We rigorously analyze the convergence
rates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our
findings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity
of coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on
coefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional
covariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of
auxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a
data-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources. The
effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive
simulation studies and an application to occupation time analysis using
physical activity data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey.

### [465] [Node Splitting SVMs for Survival Trees Based on an L2-Regularized Dipole Splitting Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11416)
*Aye Aye Maung,Drew Lazar,Qi Zheng*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a node-splitting SVM method for building survival trees that handle non-linear partitioning of survival data, showing improved predictive power and compactness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in existing non-parametric survival regression trees, particularly the dependency on at-most oblique splits and the absence of non-linear splitting capabilities.

Method: The approach extends a prior dipole-splitting criterion method by introducing ridge regularization, enabling the use of kernel methods to create both linear and non-linear splits for survival trees.

Result: Tests with both real and simulated datasets demonstrate that trees created using non-linear splits (e.g., polynomial and Gaussian kernels) achieve similar predictive power while often being smaller in size than trees generated from simpler splitting techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a flexible, robust, and scalable solution for non-linearly partitioning survival data, improving on existing approaches and making it applicable to a variety of survival data scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel, node-splitting support vector machine (SVM) for
creating survival trees. This approach is capable of non-linearly partitioning
survival data which includes continuous, right-censored outcomes. Our method
improves on an existing non-parametric method, which uses at most oblique
splits to induce survival regression trees. In the prior work, these oblique
splits were created via a non-SVM approach, by minimizing a piece-wise linear
objective, called a dipole splitting criterion, constructed from pairs of
covariates and their associated survival information. We extend this method by
enabling splits from a general class of non-linear surfaces. We achieve this by
ridge regularizing the dipole-splitting criterion to enable application of
kernel methods in a manner analogous to classical SVMs. The ridge
regularization provides robustness and can be tuned. Using various kernels, we
induce both linear and non-linear survival trees to compare their sizes and
predictive powers on real and simulated data sets. We compare traditional
univariate log-rank splits, oblique splits using the original dipole-splitting
criterion and a variety of non-linear splits enabled by our method. In these
tests, trees created by non-linear splits, using polynomial and Gaussian
kernels show similar predictive power while often being of smaller sizes
compared to trees created by univariate and oblique splits. This approach
provides a novel and flexible array of survival trees that can be applied to
diverse survival data sets.

### [466] [Measuring multi-calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11251)
*Ido Guy,Daniel Haimovich,Fridolin Linder,Nastaran Okati,Lorenzo Perini,Niek Tax,Mark Tygert*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalar metric for assessing multi-calibration, which builds on the Kuiper statistic and overcomes issues related to standard metrics like binning or kernel density estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a meaningful and robust metric to measure the distance from perfect multi-calibration in predictive modeling, which is critical for evaluating the reliability of probabilistic predictions across various subpopulations.

Method: The authors proposed a new multi-calibration metric that incorporates signal-to-noise ratios to weigh subpopulations and avoids problems common to binning and kernel density estimation.

Result: The performance of the new metric is demonstrated using numerical examples and benchmark datasets, with ablation studies showing its effectiveness when signal-to-noise weighting is included.

Conclusion: The proposed metric provides a reliable and informative way to assess multi-calibration, offering advantages over traditional methods and performing well in practical numerical analyses.

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

*Claudio Borile,Jacopo Lenti,Valentina Ghidini,Corrado Monti,Gianmarco De Francisci Morales*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the statistical estimators for two key parameters of bounded confidence models (BCMs) and their limitations, offering insights into their calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand phenomena of consensus, fragmentation, or polarization in populations by connecting opinion dynamics models (BCMs) to real-world data and reliably estimating their parameters.

Method: Maximum likelihood estimation is employed to study the properties of statistical estimators for the confidence bound and convergence rate in BCMs.

Result: The confidence bound estimator exhibits small-sample bias but is consistent, while the convergence rate estimator has a persistent bias. Joint estimation faces challenges due to identifiability issues in specific parameter regions.

Conclusion: Analyzing likelihood functions provides a structured approach to understanding estimation challenges in BCMs, enabling more robust calibration of agent-based models.

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

*Stefan Schoder,Aneta Furmanová,Viktor Hruška*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving 3D acoustic wave fields at low frequencies, highlighting challenges like convergence, boundary conditions, and source modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the goal of developing better computational methods using PINNs to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including the challenges of 3D spaces, realistic sources, and boundary conditions.

Method: The authors analyze PINNs' performance for 3D room acoustic scenarios at low frequencies. They varied source definitions, boundary conditions, and incorporated a complex speed of sound model while comparing the $L^2$ error to finite element methods.

Result: The results reveal that a minimum of six training points per wavelength is required for accurate PINN training and predictions. The study also evaluates the PINN loss landscape and its convergence behavior.

Conclusion: PINNs show promise in modeling 3D room acoustics but require careful attention to training density and configuration for convergence. The findings contribute to the broader aim of acoustics modeling with realistic absorptive conditions.

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLEAN-MI, a pipeline to construct large-scale, high-quality EEG data for motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), addressing issues like noise, device heterogeneity, and inter-subject variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in EEG data for MI-based BCIs, such as signal noise, electrode heterogeneity, and inter-subject differences, which hinder robust model training.

Method: The paper proposes CLEAN-MI, a data construction pipeline combining frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to standardize and improve EEG datasets.

Result: CLEAN-MI demonstrated its utility by improving the quality and classification performance of multiple public MI datasets.

Conclusion: CLEAN-MI provides a scalable solution for enhancing MI neurodata, supporting the development of robust and generalizable foundation models in BCIs.

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: This paper introduces a digital hardware architecture for real-time neural network training, optimized for high-throughput data directly near detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extracting relevant information in real time from abundant dynamic data, which traditional filtering methods struggle to handle.

Method: The authors propose an implementation-independent architecture for in-situ neural network training on FPGA hardware. They analyze system parameters affecting performance and explore trade-offs.

Result: A proof-of-concept implementation on an FPGA showed successful in-situ training, preserving computational accuracy, and scalability to train networks of up to 3,500 neurons per chip.

Conclusion: This scalable and adaptable architecture enables real-time learning at the detector level, paving the way for extreme-edge data processing.

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,
real-time information processing.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes PMF-CEC, an enhancement to the previous ED-CEC method for improving rare word recognition in ASR systems, particularly homophones, by leveraging phoneme information and retention probability. Experiments show improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with recognizing rare words, especially homophones. The paper aims to improve contextual biasing methods to enhance transcription accuracy.

Method: PMF-CEC integrates phoneme features for distinguishing homophones and uses a retention probability mechanism to filter low-confidence editing operations, enhancing error detection and correction.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior biased word error rate and homophone correction accuracy for PMF-CEC compared to ED-CEC and other contextual biasing methods.

Conclusion: PMF-CEC improves upon ED-CEC with better rare word correction, faster inference, and greater robustness, making it a valuable alternative to other contextual biasing and LLM-based methods.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving federated learning (FL) techniques for privacy-preserving recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech, showcasing enhanced performance using regularization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of recognizing dysarthric and elderly speech while ensuring data privacy through FL, despite challenges like data scarcity, imbalance, and speaker variability.

Method: Systematic exploration of regularized FL techniques, including parameter-based, embedding-based, and novel loss-based regularizations applied at various stages of the FL process.

Result: Regularized FL significantly improves performance, achieving WER reductions of up to 0.55% absolute (2.13% relative) compared to baseline FedAvg. Increasing communication frequency further improves results, approaching centralized training performance.

Conclusion: Enhanced regularized FL systems offer statistically significant improvements in privacy-preserving speech recognition for dysarthric and elderly speakers, mitigating existing challenges in FL.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

intelligent, data-driven urban road management, making the future of mobility
both achievable and sustainable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to support teachers in efficiently scoring reading exercises through automated reading evaluation, addressing the limited research in reading evaluation systems.

Method: The method involves using multimodal approaches with Whisper and instruction-tuned LLMs, incorporating targeted prompts for transcriptions and downstream tasks like reading mistake detection.

Result: The proposed system achieved state-of-the-art performance in Dutch child read speech with a reduced word error rate (WER) from 9.4% to 5.1%, and improved reading mistake detection F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

Conclusion: Prompting Whisper and LLMs are effective strategies for enhancing child speech recognition and reading evaluation, offering a significant improvement over baseline models.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on
reading evaluation systems and applications remains limited. We present a novel
multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child
speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading
mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without
prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art recognition
performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation of advanced TTS models in rendering Mathematical eXpressions (MX) intelligibly and accurately, advancing their usability in practical applications involving math-heavy content.

Method: Designed experiments involving listening and transcription tests for TTS outputs of MX. For translations, two Large Language Models (LLMs) generated English pronunciation from LaTeX-formatted MX before TTS evaluation. Assessments involved Mean Opinion Scores and transcription correctness.

Result: Findings revealed that TTS models generally produce outputs for MX with limited intelligibility and varying quality across models and MX categories. Human expert renditions were significantly better, and LLM choice minimally impacted the results.

Conclusion: Current TTS models are inadequate for rendering MX intelligibly and require significant improvements and optimization for handling math-specific inputs effectively.

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework using large language models (LLMs) to simplify and enhance pseudo-labeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR), outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current pseudo-label generation for ASR, such as error propagation and disjoint optimization, and improve transcription accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a unified framework leveraging postprocessing by textual or speech-based large language models (LLMs) instead of traditional ensemble arbitration methods.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows significant transcription accuracy improvements and better performance in semi-supervised ASR models using LLM-generated pseudo-labels.

Conclusion: LLM-based methods enhance both transcription accuracy and semi-supervised ASR performance while simplifying the pseudo-labeling process.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the reliability of two speech analysis tools (OpenSMILE and Praat) for use in behavioral models involving adolescents with autism, uncovering disparities in feature extraction that affect model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the gap in validation of speech processing tools, which raises concerns about reproducibility, fairness, and bias in diverse clinical populations.

Method: The authors assess the reliability of speech features extracted by OpenSMILE and Praat in adolescents with autism and analyze how these features influence model outcomes across contexts and demographics.

Result: Significant variability in extracted features was found between the two tools, leading to variations in the performance of machine learning models.

Conclusion: Reliability and context-specific validation of speech processing tools are essential to improve the fairness and efficacy of clinical behavioral modeling applications.

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the analysis of child speech data captured via child-worn devices to advance speech sciences and make such large-scale data more usable.

Method: Three years of experimental analysis were conducted to improve Voice Type Classification, assessing representation features, architecture, parameter optimization, and data strategies.

Result: Marginal gains were achieved through representation, architecture, and parameter tuning, while significant progress stemmed from focusing on data relevance and quantity.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of collecting and sharing relevant and sufficient data, with appropriate permissions, as a path to overcoming Voice Type Classification challenges.

Abstract: Recordings gathered with child-worn devices promised to revolutionize both
fundamental and applied speech sciences by allowing the effortless capture of
children's naturalistic speech environment and language production. This
promise hinges on speech technologies that can transform the sheer mounds of
data thus collected into usable information. This paper demonstrates several
obstacles blocking progress by summarizing three years' worth of experiments
aimed at improving one fundamental task: Voice Type Classification. Our
experiments suggest that improvements in representation features, architecture,
and parameter search contribute to only marginal gains in performance. More
progress is made by focusing on data relevance and quantity, which highlights
the importance of collecting data with appropriate permissions to allow
sharing.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of child-worn audio recording devices for language research, addresses automated analysis challenges, and proposes troubleshooting tools to ensure data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to accurately capture children's language input and production in a natural environment with minimal observer bias, while tackling challenges in automated data processing.

Method: The authors review knowledge on child-worn recording techniques, identify sources of error in automated analyses, and propose potential troubleshooting metrics to improve data quality.

Result: The paper identifies key challenges in data accuracy and quality control and offers practical strategies to overcome these obstacles.

Conclusion: Researchers can enhance the reliability of child-worn audio recording studies through thoughtful data quality assessment and contextualization, despite the absence of a fully automated quality control system.

Abstract: Audio-recordings collected with a child-worn device are a fundamental tool in
child language research. Long-form recordings collected over whole days promise
to capture children's input and production with minimal observer bias, and
therefore high validity. The sheer volume of resulting data necessitates
automated analysis to extract relevant metrics for researchers and clinicians.
This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry
points to existing resources. We also highlight various sources of error that
threaten the accuracy of automated annotations and the interpretation of
resulting metrics. To address this, we propose potential troubleshooting
metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality
control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers
to improve data collection and contextualize their analyses.

### [480] [Complexity of normalized stochastic first-order methods with momentum under heavy-tailed noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11214)
*Chuan He,Zhaosong Lu,Defeng Sun,Zhanwang Deng*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces new stochastic first-order methods using various momentum techniques and updated parameters, achieving improved or competitive performance under relaxed assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address optimization problems without depending on strong assumptions like bounded variance or mean-squared smoothness.

Method: Introduces normalized stochastic first-order methods featuring different momentum strategies and avoids reliance on problem-dependent parameters.

Result: Achieved improved or matching first-order oracle complexity bounds and validated practical effectiveness through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide state-of-the-art efficiency and effectiveness for optimization under less restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

### [481] [Convergence of Momentum-Based Optimization Algorithms with Time-Varying Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11904)
*Mathukumalli Vidyasagar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified momentum-based stochastic optimization algorithm that generalizes existing methods and supports unbounded gradient bias and variance, ensuring robust convergence of zero-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance stochastic optimization techniques by introducing a flexible framework that accounts for time-varying momentum and accommodates broader conditions, including biased and unbounded stochastic gradients.

Method: The approach presents a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization incorporating both Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (SNAG), extending them with time-dependent momentum and general assumptions for stochastic gradients.

Result: The paper establishes sufficient conditions for convergence of the proposed unified algorithm and critiques an alternative time-varying momentum method for SHB, identifying it as impractical.

Conclusion: The research generalizes momentum-based stochastic optimization, proving its efficacy under broader assumptions and highlighting drawbacks in comparable methodologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

*Yingrui Zhuang,Lin Cheng,Yuji Cao,Tongxin Li,Ning Qi,Yan Xu,Yue Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Quantum learning techniques improve energy usage coordination between distribution networks and energy communities, yielding major computational savings and accuracy enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in coordinating energy usage between distribution networks and energy communities due to limited information and computational complexity.

Method: A hybrid quantum model (Q-TCN-LSTM) and quantum estimation techniques based on quantum amplitude estimation and phase-rotation circuits are introduced.

Result: The Q-TCN-LSTM model improves mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing model size by 99.75% and computation time by 93.9%; QAE achieves comparable accuracy with up to 99.99% computational time reduction.

Conclusion: Quantum approaches significantly outperform classical methods in mapping and estimation tasks, offering transformative potential for energy coordination scenarios.

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

*Jinzhe Jiang,Yaqian Zhao,Xin Zhang,Chen Li,Yunlong Yu,Hailing Liu*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper adapts the parameter-shift rule (PSR) to compute analytical gradients directly from hardware measurements in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs), overcoming physical constraints in optical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional backpropagation encounters challenges in optical neural networks due to their physical constraints, creating a need for alternative gradient computation techniques.

Method: The paper introduces and adapts the parameter-shift rule (PSR) to train UONNs based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes using Fourier series properties of optical interference.

Result: The approach successfully computes exact analytical gradients for phase parameters in UONNs through hardware measurements, avoiding limitations of finite difference and all-optical backpropagation.

Conclusion: PSR provides a practical and efficient alternative to traditional training methods in optical systems, paving the way for hardware-based optical neural network training.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in machine learning models by investigating differential privacy techniques and their implications.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive review of DP, tracing its evolution and discussing integration methods into ML models, alongside evaluations and real-world applications.

Result: The paper compiles key definitions, research contributions, implemented techniques, and evaluations of DP in the context of machine learning.

Conclusion: Differential privacy is essential for secure and responsible AI systems, but challenges like adversarial attacks require further research and solutions.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not

limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing

### [485] [KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612)
*Zhijie Liu,Qiyi Tang,Sen Nie,Shi Wu,Liang Feng Zhang,Yutian Tang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: KEENHash introduces a novel hashing method using LLM-generated function embeddings for efficient and effective program-level binary code similarity analysis, achieving significant speed and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing function-level diffing tools for binary code similarity analysis face scalability issues, especially in large-scale scenarios.

Method: The authors propose KEENHash, which uses large language model-generated function embeddings combined with K-Means and Feature Hashing to compute a compact, fixed-length representation of binaries.

Result: KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than traditional tools and achieves higher effectiveness. In a test with 5.3 billion evaluations, it completed in 395.83 seconds compared to the 56 days required by previous methods.

Conclusion: KEENHash offers a transformative solution to program-level binary code similarity analysis, outperforming current methods in speed, scalability, and accuracy, and demonstrates strong applicability in fields like malware detection.

Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many
fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are
the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for
evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a
high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g.,
1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we
propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into
program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated
function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and
fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us
to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the
previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash
is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools
while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with
5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while
these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the
program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305
binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of
them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the
large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.

*Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinwen Hou,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaussMarker, a dual-domain watermarking method for Diffusion Models (DM) that embeds watermarks in both spatial and frequency domains, and includes a Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods for Diffusion Models struggle with robustness under image manipulation and attacks, making copyright and misuse concerns pressing.

Method: The paper employs a pipelined dual-domain injector for watermark embedding and a model-independent Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to improve robustness and detection.

Result: GaussMarker achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight image distortions and four advanced attack scenarios in three versions of Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: The dual-domain watermarking and GNR approach effectively enhances robustness, recall, and reduces false positives, making it suitable for real-world use cases.

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

### [487] [Investigating Vulnerabilities and Defenses Against Audio-Visual Attacks: A Comprehensive Survey Emphasizing Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11521)
*Jinming Wen,Xinyi Wu,Shuai Zhao,Yanhao Jia,Yuwen Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reviews various types of audio-visual attacks (including adversarial, backdoor, and jailbreak attacks) targeting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and outlines future research challenges and trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of MLLMs in audio-visual tasks has created significant progress, but their susceptibility to security vulnerabilities, such as adversarial manipulation, backdoor threats, and jailbreak attacks, necessitates a deeper unified analysis.

Method: The study performs a comprehensive and systematic review of the state of audio-visual attacks, classifying them into adversarial, backdoor, and jailbreak categories, while also including exploratory insights into attacks targeting contemporary MLLMs.

Result: The review identifies numerous types of threats, mechanisms bypassing security features, and highlights gaps in prior work, especially concerning integrated understanding across multiple attack types in audio-visual domains.

Conclusion: The paper provides an integrated perspective of audio-visual attack types and underscores the need for advanced security mechanisms and research focused on defending against emerging threats in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecONNds addresses privacy challenges in neural network inference by introducing an optimized secure framework, achieving significant computational and communication efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the privacy concerns of processing sensitive user data during outsourced neural network inference, making secure inference practical for large-scale networks.

Method: SecONNds employs a Boolean GMW protocol for secure comparison, NTT preprocessing, GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption, and includes SecONNds-P for exact results.

Result: SecONNds achieves 17x speedup in non-linear operations, 1.6x on CPU and 2.2x on GPU for linear operations, and processes large models with minimal communication overhead.

Conclusion: SecONNds is efficient and suitable for resource-constrained environments, addressing the privacy challenges of outsourced inference securely and practically.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and
can be accessed from: https://github.com/shashankballa/SecONNds.

*Shaun Shuster,Eyal Zaloof,Asaf Shabtai,Rami Puzis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Fraud Analyst Assistant (FAA) framework using multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud investigations and reduce alert fatigue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce growth has increased fraud via stolen credit card details, overwhelming fraud analysts who face countless alerts and suffer from alert fatigue.

Method: The FAA framework employs multi-modal LLMs with reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities to systematically plan, collect evidence, and analyze fraud cases while producing explanatory reports.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 500 credit card fraud investigations shows that the FAA framework reliably conducted investigations in approximately seven steps, significantly reducing analysts' workload.

Conclusion: The FAA framework automates substantial portions of fraud investigations, enhancing efficiency and alleviating alert fatigue for fraud analysts.

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

*Tran Thanh Lam Nguyen,Barbara Carminati,Elena Ferrari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper discusses using Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle security and privacy risks in mobile apps, highlighting their potential to replace traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of security and privacy threats in mobile apps necessitates advanced detection techniques.

Method: Applying LLMs to mitigate top mobile security threats, including sensitive data leakage detection in user-shared images.

Result: The study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of LLMs in identifying and addressing mobile app-related risks.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as alternatives to traditional methods for security analysis, but there are still open challenges to address.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

### [491] [Today's Cat Is Tomorrow's Dog: Accounting for Time-Based Changes in the Labels of ML Vulnerability Detection Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11939)
*Ranindya Paramitha,Yuan Feng,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of changing labels in ML vulnerability datasets over time and proposes a restructuring methodology to study performance trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past approaches to vulnerability detection either optimistically use complete historical datasets or conservatively compare consecutive releases, which may not reflect real-world performance due to changing labels over time.

Method: The authors restructure datasets using chronologically aligned labels to account for changes at the time of testing. They validate their methodology on 4 time-based datasets and 5 ML models.

Result: Contrary to expectations that more retrospective information improves performance, the study finds inconsistent performance trends across years for most models, indicating they may not be effectively learning.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology reveals that performance metrics change unpredictably as labels evolve, highlighting limitations in current ML models for longitudinal vulnerability detection.

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating AI operations directly with encrypted data, ensuring security and high performance.

Method: Testing HbHAI-protected datasets with off-the-shelf AI algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning, including clustering, classification, and deep neural networks.

Result: The analysis confirmed the claims regarding HbHAI's security, operability, and performance with minor reservations.

Conclusion: HbHAI offers a disruptive cryptographic mechanism that integrates securely with AI operations, but minor issues may need further attention.

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

*Armina Fani,Mike Doan,Isabelle Le,Alex Fedorov,Malte Hoffmann,Chris Rorden,Sergey Plis*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MindGrab is a highly efficient deep learning model for skull-stripping in various imaging modalities. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much lower computational and memory requirements compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the inefficiencies in existing skull-stripping techniques, particularly their high parameter and memory requirements, and to create a tool that is accessible on a variety of hardware.

Method: The paper introduces MindGrab, a fully convolutional deep-learning model designed with a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions. It was trained on synthetic, modality-agnostic data and evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal scans with benchmark comparisons against existing methods.

Result: MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 (SD 1.6), matching or surpassing the performance of existing methods like SynthStrip, while significantly outperforming ROBEX and BET. The model uses 95% fewer parameters compared to SynthStrip and demonstrates notable computational and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: MindGrab provides state-of-the-art skull-stripping performance across imaging modalities with dramatically reduced resource usage, making it highly accessible on a range of hardware platforms. It is available as part of the brainchop-cli tool for public use.

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

### [494] [Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11139)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) across various tasks and signal types, finding that regularized grids often outperform INRs, except for specialized cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capacity, implicit biases, and performance scaling of INRs across tasks and signals.

Method: The study benchmarks diverse INRs against regularized grids across tasks like tomography, super-resolution, and denoising, stratified by model size and signal type/bandwidth.

Result: Regularized grids outperform INRs in training speed and quality for most tasks, with INRs excelling in fitting low-dimensional structures like shape contours.

Conclusion: Regularized grids are often more effective than INRs, but INRs have niche advantages and potential specific applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

*Wenlong Hou,Gangqian Yang,Ye Du,Yeung Lau,Lihao Liu,Junjun He,Ling Long,Shujun Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ADAgent is an AI model specifically designed for Alzheimer's disease, leveraging large language models to improve multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often rely on single-modality data, limiting the effectiveness of AD diagnosis and prognosis. There's a need for systems that can leverage multi-modal data and handle diverse tasks.

Method: ADAgent employs a large language model combined with reasoning engines, advanced medical tools, and collaborative outcome coordination to integrate diverse multi-modal inputs.

Result: ADAgent notably improves diagnostic and prognostic performance, achieving up to a 2.7% enhancement in multi-modal diagnosis and a 0.7% improvement in prognosis.

Conclusion: ADAgent demonstrates significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods in addressing Alzheimer's diagnosis and prognosis, showcasing its utility for medical applications.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

### [496] [Vector Representations of Vessel Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11163)
*James Batten,Michiel Schaap,Matthew Sinclair,Ying Bai,Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents VeTTA, a novel Transformer-based framework for representing tree-structured 3D vascular networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an efficient and accurate method for modeling 3D vascular networks, addressing the challenges of geometric detail preservation, topology consistency, and scalability.

Method: The framework employs two Transformer-based autoencoders trained sequentially: one for segment-level geometry and another for the tree-level topology, ensuring valid reconstruction and efficient memory usage.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and medical imaging datasets show superior topology reconstruction, fidelity, and realistic interpolations compared to 3D convolutional approaches.

Conclusion: VeTTA proves to be a scalable and precise method for anatomical tree modeling, offering significant improvements in GPU efficiency and topological accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

### [497] [DiffPR: Diffusion-Based Phase Reconstruction via Frequency-Decoupled Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11183)
*Yi Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffPR, a two-stage framework to address oversmoothing issues in phase imaging by canceling high-frequency skips and using diffusion models for detail synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversmoothing in quantitative phase imaging leads to loss of fine diagnostic details due to spectral bias in existing methods.

Method: DiffPR decouples frequency contributions: Stage 1 uses a modified U-Net to capture low-frequency structures, and Stage 2 employs diffusion models to refine high-frequency details.

Result: DiffPR outperformed standard U-Net baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB, reducing MAE by 11%, and delivering sharper diagnostic features across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Canceling high-frequency skips and using diffusion models effectively mitigates spectral bias, improving generalization and fidelity in phase imaging.

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

### [498] [Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11283)
*Joakim Andén,Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transformer-based neural network architecture for clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM images, outperforming conventional DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional denoising methods struggle in high-noise settings like cryo-EM images, necessitating advanced approaches that leverage the redundancy of multiple projection images.

Method: The authors propose a deep learning architecture based on transformers that integrates clustering, aligning, and denoising directly in the cryo-EM image processing pipeline.

Result: On synthetic datasets, the method reduced relative mean squared error (MSE) by 45% compared to single-image DNNs at a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.03.

Conclusion: The transformer-based architecture demonstrates superior performance for denoising in high-noise scenarios, highlighting its potential for improving cryo-EM image analysis.

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Xiaoning Li,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAD-Net, a deep learning model, improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection using frequency-domain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease is a significant cause of mortality, and accurate segmentation from invasive coronary angiography is essential for effective clinical decisions.

Method: Proposed FAD-Net with a frequency-domain attention mechanism and cascading diffusion strategy. It includes Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA) and Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) for detailed segmentation.

Result: FAD-Net achieved a 0.8717 Dice coefficient for segmentation and promising performance in stenosis detection, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: FAD-Net is effective for coronary artery analysis, offering clinical utility in diagnosing and planning CAD treatment.

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

*Chunlei Li,Yilei Shi,Haoxi Hu,Jingliang Hu,Xiao Xiang Zhu,Lichao Mou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework leveraging Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution, improving imaging quality with lower radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in CT super-resolution caused by complex degradation and limited medical training data while maintaining patient safety.

Method: The framework uses Stable Diffusion with a degradation model to synthesize low-quality images, paired with vision-language descriptions, and applies a specialized controlling strategy during super-resolution.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant reduction in radiation dose while achieving high-quality CT imaging, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: This approach provides a promising solution for safer and superior CT imaging, with the potential to address challenges in the medical imaging domain.

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new super-resolution solution for compressed video that is efficient and scalable, addressing issues like slow inference, complex training pipelines, and auxiliary information reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the limitations of SOTA CVSR methods, which include prolonged inference times and inadequate methods for exploiting frame-to-frame differences in increasing frame rate scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a modular architecture leveraging hyperspectral image structural/statistical similarities and a compression-driven dimensionality reduction approach for extracting temporal information across frames.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method matches or surpasses SOTA models in performance while significantly reducing inference time.

Conclusion: The study offers a practical pathway to improve video super-resolution technology efficiently, with strong adaptability and integration potential in existing frameworks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

*Yifei Tang,Hongjie Jiang,Changhong Jing,Hieu Pham,Shuqiang Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents a fine-tuned brain network model leveraging multi-dimensional representations and a transformer for brain disease diagnosis using self-supervised and pre-trained fMRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain network models for disease analysis are constrained to single-dimensional representation, limiting their application in neuroscience.

Method: The model employs an adapter module for multi-dimensional brain region representation, combined with a fine-tuned transformer-based brain network utilizing self-supervised learning pre-trained on extensive fMRI data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior diagnostic performance for brain diseases compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances generalizability and effectively aids in brain disease diagnosis, offering a promising direction for brain network analysis.

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

*Zuzanna Skorniewska,Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates loss functions for generating synthetic medical images with accurate vascular details, concluding that conventional edge detection outperforms domain-specific deep features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the constraints in medical imaging, such as privacy issues, limited data availability, and demographic biases, by exploring the potential of deep generative models in creating clinically accurate synthetic data.

Method: The study compares a distance-based loss function using deep activation layers from a foundational model with perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss functions in generating synthetic color fundus retinal images.

Result: The study found that conventional edge-detection filters are more effective in enhancing the sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic images, while domain-specific deep features do not provide significant improvements.

Conclusion: Conventional edge-detection based loss functions offer a practical and effective approach for generating synthetic medical images, especially for replicating precise vascular structures, without the need for domain-specific deep features.

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity

*Zhangkai Ni,Yang Zhang,Wenhan Yang,Hanli Wang,Shiqi Wang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding (SSIU) method for efficient image super-resolution, blending data-driven and model-driven approaches to achieve high performance with reduced model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven methods for image super-resolution often increase model complexity by leveraging deeper networks or transformer-based attention mechanisms. The authors aim to address this challenge by developing an efficient approach that combines the strengths of data-driven and model-driven strategies.

Method: The proposed SSIU method unfolds an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity. It employs multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse Attention Module (ESAM) within each iteration to restrict features comprehensively and achieve sparse activation. Additionally, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS) integrates multi-level feature information.

Result: The proposed SSIU method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in image super-resolution tasks, achieving better results while using fewer parameters and consuming less memory.

Conclusion: The SSIU approach successfully balances performance and model compactness, delivering state-of-the-art image super-resolution results with reduced computational complexity. The method showcases the potential of combining structural similarity constraints with unfolding paradigms for efficient model design.

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The crossMoDA challenge series focuses on unsupervised cross-modality MRI segmentation for Vestibular Schwannoma and cochlea to improve clinical cost-efficiency. It has evolved from single to multi-institutional datasets to enhance its relevance, with mixed outcomes observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an effective and illustrative benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality segmentation in medical imaging, with the clinical goal of enhancing cost-effective Vestibular Schwannoma management.

Method: The study reports findings from successive yearly editions (2022–2023) of the crossMoDA challenge, analyzing how data diversity, protocol variation, and updated task complexity influence segmentation performance.

Result: Expanding dataset and increased data heterogeneity notably reduced outliers, but cochlea segmentation performance declined due to added complexity. The top approach in 2023 was robust across prior challenge data.

Conclusion: While advancements show promise, performance plateau suggests future challenges need a more complex task for effective benchmarking. Clinical VS segmentation is still an open area for improvement.

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

*Jiaqi Wu,Jiahong Ouyang,Farshad Moradi,Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi,Greg Zaharchuk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores using deep learning models, including diffusion models, for synthesizing PET images from MRI data to reduce radiation exposure in epilepsy imaging. Diffusion model SGM-KD showed the best performance for MRI-to-PET synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high radiation doses in epilepsy imaging, particularly in younger populations, by synthesizing PET images from MRI or low-dose PET using advanced AI techniques.

Method: The study compared three deep learning models—two score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion and SGM-Variance Preserving) and Transformer-Unet. These were evaluated using standard and clinically relevant metrics on PET/MRI data from 52 subjects.

Result: SGM-KD achieved the best results for pure MRI-to-PET synthesis, offering the lowest mean absolute error and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. Inclusion of 1% low-dose PET improved performance across all models.

Conclusion: Score-based generative models show strong potential for generating diagnostic-quality PET images purely from MRI, with all evaluated models performing well when combining MRI with ultralow-dose PET.

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful
exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI
introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial
development.

### [509] [Interaction, Process, Infrastructure: A Unified Architecture for Human-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11718)
*Yun Wang,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to enhance collaboration between humans and AI agents across interaction, process, and infrastructure dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI tools currently assist in isolated tasks but lack a cohesive structure for sustained collaboration in aiding knowledge work.

Method: The authors introduce a layered framework focusing on explicit, inspectable, and adaptable processes to align humans and AI towards shared goals over time.

Result: Their model highlights limitations in current tools, unifies system design approaches, and uncovers new avenues for research in human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: By structuring collaboration at the process level, the paper reimagines AI systems as coherent and aligned collaborators in professional settings rather than task-specific tools.

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

### [510] [Enter: Graduated Realism: A Pedagogical Framework for AI-Powered Avatars in Virtual Reality Teacher Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11890)
*Judson Leroy Dean Haynes IV*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper reviews the impact of avatar realism in VR teacher training, arguing for a pedagogy-oriented approach and proposing a 'Graduated Realism' framework supported by a novel computational model, Crazy Slots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of determining optimal avatar realism in VR teacher training, balancing technological advancements with pedagogical efficiency, and mitigating cognitive overload on trainees.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the progression of avatar realism in VR and synthesize theoretical and empirical findings. Learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory were applied, and a novel framework, Graduated Realism, along with a computational model, Crazy Slots, was proposed.

Result: The review found that overly realistic avatars can burden beginners with cognitive overload, highlighting a gap between technological advancements and pedagogical needs. Graduated Realism and Crazy Slots offer scalable solutions for bridging this gap.

Conclusion: A balance between avatar realism and pedagogical needs is essential for effective teacher training in VR. Graduated Realism and Crazy Slots provide a grounded, scalable pathway to integrate AI-powered avatars effectively.

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

### [511] [Synchronous Propagation of Periodic Signals in Feedforward Networks of Standard Model Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11776)
*Ian Stewart,David Wood*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper explores the stability of periodic signals along chains modeled by neuron networks using several standard neuron models and discusses theoretical and numerical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and design stable mechanisms for periodic signal propagation in biological systems, such as locomotion and peristalsis, as well as in applications like continuum robotics.

Method: Analyzed the transverse stability of periodic orbit propagations along neuronal chains constructed via 'feedforward lifts' of central pattern generators using different neuron models like FitzHugh-Nagumo and Hodgkin-Huxley. Conducted numerical simulations to validate theoretical conditions.

Result: Demonstrated that propagating signals in examined neuron models exhibit transverse Floquet stability. Highlighted variations based on model and stability definitions.

Conclusion: The study confirms theoretical predictions about transverse stability in these models and suggests implications for more realistic neuronal chain systems.

Abstract: Periodic signals propagating along chains are common in biology, for example
in locomotion and peristalsis, and are also of interest for continuum robots.
In previous work we constructed such networks as 'feedforward lifts' of a
central pattern generator (CPG). When the CPG undergoes periodic oscillations,
created by Hopf bifurcation or other mechanisms, it can then transmit periodic
signals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous or
phase-synchronous manner. We proved necessary and sufficient conditions for the
stability of these lifted periodic orbits, in several senses. Here we examine
the implications of the resulting theory for chains of neurons, using several
standard neuron models: FitzHugh-Nagumo, Morris-Lecar, Hindmarsh-Rose, and
Hodgkin-Huxley. We compare different notions of transverse stability, and
summarize some numerical simulations showing that for all these neuron models
the propagating signal can be transversely Floquet stable. Finally we discuss
implications for less idealized models.

### [512] [Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on NISQ hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11225)
*Aditi Rath,Dinesh Kumar Panda,Colin Benjamin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates controlling quantum chaos using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on NISQ hardware, demonstrating experimental methods to transition between chaos and order using quantum walks on cyclic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of NISQ computing systems, particularly in controlling quantum chaos through quantum walks, with the goal of enabling applications like cryptography and advanced algorithms.

Method: The study implements DTQW on cyclic graphs using a quantum Fourier transform to optimize circuit performance, experimentally testing on odd and even cyclic graphs in NISQ devices, and enhancing fidelity with methods like dynamical decoupling pulses.

Result: High-fidelity DTQW was achieved on 4-cycle graphs, and significant fidelity improvements were made for 3-cycle graphs with added techniques. Controlled transitions between chaos and order were observed experimentally.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical methodology for leveraging quantum walks to study and control quantum chaos in NISQ hardware, revealing potential applications in quantum algorithm and cryptographic development.

Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are
steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on
specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and
control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW)
on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we
employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift
operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the
transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even
cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive
Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the
4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle
implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with
dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to
probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware,
laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols
based on quantum walks.

### [513] [HQFNN: A Compact Quantum-Fuzzy Neural Network for Accurate Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11146)
*Jianhong Yao,Yangming Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN), blending quantum computing, fuzzy logic, and neural networks to achieve high accuracy, noise resilience, and efficiency in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of deep learning systems in handling noisy inputs and explaining model confidence by integrating quantum computing and fuzzy logic for more interpretable and robust solutions.

Method: HQFNN utilizes a shallow quantum circuit to encode fuzzy logic operations. It maps features to quantum states, processes them with a compact rule layer and a CNOT defuzzifier, and integrates the outputs with classical features for classification.

Result: HQFNN outperforms classical, fuzzy-enhanced, and quantum-only baselines with drastically fewer parameters. Its accuracy remains strong under noise, and it demonstrates scalability with sublinear circuit depth.

Conclusion: HQFNN offers a practical, compact, and interpretable model for vision applications and sets a foundation for future quantum-native fuzzy learning systems.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

*Nico Meyer,Christopher Mutschler,Andreas Maier,Daniel D. Scherer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Variational Quantum Error Correction (VarQEC) as a new method to tailor quantum error correction codes for specific noise structures, optimizing for practical usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantum error correction codes, such as the surface code, require extensive resources, which makes them unfeasible for near-term quantum devices.

Method: The authors propose a machine learning framework using a "distinguishability loss function" to optimize encoding circuits via variational techniques. This maximizes the differentiation between quantum states after a noise channel.

Result: The method generates error-correcting codes that are both theoretically and practically efficient. It also outperforms standard codes in certain scenarios and is successfully demonstrated on quantum hardware from IBM and IQM.

Conclusion: Variational Quantum Error Correction (VarQEC) is an innovative and practical approach that adapts error correction codes to specific noise structures, enhancing their applicability on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

### [515] [Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11982)
*Paulin de Schoulepnikoff,Gorka Muñoz-Gil,Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup,Hans J. Briegel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper enhances Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to better handle quantum data and extract meaningful latent representations, showcasing its potential in unsupervised quantum system analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing VAEs when applied to quantum data, as they often neglect the probabilistic nature and complex correlations intrinsic to such systems, hindering meaningful representation learning.

Method: The paper introduces two key modifications for VAEs: a decoder tailored to reproduce quantum states faithfully and a probabilistic loss function designed specifically for handling quantum data.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance on benchmark quantum spin models and experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, autonomously identifying phase structures without prior labels or system knowledge.

Conclusion: The modified VAEs show significant promise as interpretable and unsupervised tools for quantum systems, enabling the identification of latent representations that are both meaningful and physically relevant.

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.
