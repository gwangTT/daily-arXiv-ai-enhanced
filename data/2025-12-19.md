### [1] [Anubuddhi: A Multi-Agent AI System for Designing and Simulating Quantum Optics Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736)
*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anubuddhi is an AI system designed for quantum optics experiments based on natural language prompts, providing simulations and initial designs for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify quantum optics experiment design by removing the need for specialized programming expertise and enabling broader accessibility for research and education.

Method: The system uses a three-tier toolbox for arranging optical layouts, physics simulations for validating designs, and combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation.

Result: Anubuddhi demonstrated strong design-simulation alignment (scores 8-9/10) across 13 evaluated experiments. It identified that structural correctness does not guarantee quantitative accuracy, emphasizing the need for expert review of numerical predictions.

Conclusion: The system democratizes quantum optics experiment design by providing flexible mathematical representations and accessible initial designs, fostering improved research and pedagogical applications.

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

### [2] [The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740)
*Timothy Prescher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a framework for ethical decision-making under uncertainty, emphasizing the dynamic balance between action and inquiry duties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks struggle with decision-making under uncertainty, often sidelining the nuanced transformation of moral responsibilities in such scenarios.

Method: It presents the PPD framework, which ties moral duties to variables like knowledge, humility, and contextual signal strength, formalized with a mathematical equation and supported by Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show that incorporating humility as a system parameter stabilizes duty allocations and avoids overconfident decision-making.

Conclusion: The PPD framework provides a cross-disciplinary, mathematically tractable way to allocate moral responsibility, offering applications in AI, governance, clinical ethics, and law.

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

### [3] [Prompt-to-Parts: Generative AI for Physical Assembly and Scalable Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15743)
*David Noever*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that generates assembly instructions from natural language, guaranteeing physical realizability within modular 'brick-based' systems using LDraw representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D approaches lack constraints like geometric validity, buildability, and connection enforcement, creating a gap between design intent and manufacturable outputs.

Method: The authors use a Python library integrated with large language models and LDraw-based representation to translate natural language into valid step-by-step brick assembly sequences.

Result: The framework successfully produced scalable and modular brick-based prototypes, validated across domains such as satellites, aircraft, and architectural designs, ensuring fidelity to semantic designs.

Conclusion: This approach bridges semantic design and manufacturable prototyping, introducing a modular 'bag of bricks' method as a pivotal component for natural-language-guided physical modeling.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

### [4] [Emergence: Overcoming Privileged Information Bias in Asymmetric Embodied Agents via Active Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15776)
*Shaun Baek,Sam Liu,Joseph Ukpong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research addresses Privileged Information Bias in environments where a knowledgeable leader fails to aid a limited follower effectively, proposing a framework to study this and showing benefits of active querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the inability of language models to handle "symbol grounding" in asymmetric, embodied settings, where a knowledgeable agent struggles to communicate effectively with a sensor-limited follower.

Method: The authors propose an Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework using the AI2-THOR environment and analyze communication and collaboration gaps.

Result: The study identifies a critical success gap, with 50% of plans failing due to communicative errors, while pull-based protocols show better robustness with more frequent clarification requests.

Conclusion: Active uncertainty reduction, achieved through pull-based querying, is a vital mechanism for improving collaboration in human-AI and robot-robot interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

### [5] [Subjective functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15948)
*Samuel J. Gershman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the origin of objective functions and proposes the concept of subjective functions as higher-order objectives endogenous to the agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how humans synthesize objective functions and determine if artificial systems can replicate this capability.

Method: The authors introduce 'subjective functions,' studying expected prediction error as an example, and draw connections with psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

Result: The study highlights subjective functions and expected prediction errors as potential frameworks for advancing understanding in artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: Understanding subjective functions and their applications could enhance the design of intelligent artificial systems and bridge insights from psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

### [6] [AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783)
*Kit Tempest-Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Epidemiology introduces population-level surveillance methods to govern advanced AI outputs, bypassing complexity issues in current interpretability techniques and enabling experts to assess reliability without machine learning expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods for AI systems struggle with model complexity, and experts often lack tools to oversee AI outputs effectively.

Method: AI Epidemiology uses standardized fields (risk level, alignment score, accuracy score) and statistical associations of AI outputs with expert overrides to predict output failures.

Result: The framework creates automatic audit trails, validates output-failure predictions, supports updates across models/vendors, and enhances AI reliability assessment without burdening experts.

Conclusion: AI Epidemiology democratizes AI governance by allowing domain experts to oversee advanced AI systems without technical expertise, increasing reliability and reducing harm.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

### [7] [Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784)
*Zibin Liu,Cheng Zhang,Xi Zhao,Yunfei Feng,Bingyu Bai,Dahu Feng,Erhu Feng,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOBIMEM is proposed as a memory-centric agent architecture, avoiding continuous retraining and improving personalization, capability, and efficiency in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents face challenges in evolving post-deployment due to model retraining overheads and an accuracy-latency trade-off.

Method: MOBIMEM uses three specialized memory primitives (Profile Memory, Experience Memory, Action Memory) and integrates OS-like services for efficient and safe agent operation.

Result: MOBIMEM outperformed baselines with 83.1% profile alignment, 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster), a 50.3% task success rate improvement, and 9x latency reduction.

Conclusion: MOBIMEM effectively enables iterative self-evolution, improving the efficiency and success of LLM agents without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

### [8] [State-Augmented Graphs for Circular Economy Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15824)
*Richard Fox,Rui Li,Gustav Jonsson,Farzaneh Goli,Miying Yang,Emel Aktas,Yongjing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-making framework for Circular Economy (CE) triage using a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize sustainable end-of-life decisions for products by balancing value retention, costs, and labor constraints.

Method: Developed a deterministic model using Markov property-based recursive evaluation of CE options, integrating diagnostic health scores and operational constraints.

Result: The framework was illustrated with a hierarchical triage example of EV batteries, effectively accommodating mechanical, safety, and economic considerations.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable and provides a robust foundation for optimizing CE triage across various products and operational scenarios.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

### [9] [PediatricAnxietyBench: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Under Parental Anxiety and Pressure in Pediatric Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15894)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study focuses on the safety of large language models (LLMs) in providing pediatric advice under adversarial pressure and introduces the PediatricAnxietyBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand and evaluate the safety of large language models when providing critical guidance to anxious parents, especially under adversarial conditions.

Method: Two LLMs (Llama 70B and 8B) were evaluated using a new benchmark (PediatricAnxietyBench) consisting of 300 pediatric queries, covering realistic and adversarial situations, and analyzed across a safety framework.

Result: The 70B model showed better safety performance compared to the 8B model, but both exhibited vulnerabilities, especially under adversarial conditions with urgency and economic barriers reducing their safety effectiveness.

Conclusion: Model scale improves safety to a degree; however, all current models are susceptible to significant clinical risks under adversarial scenarios and PediatricAnxietyBench aids in diagnosing such weaknesses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

### [10] [Darth Vecdor: An Open-Source System for Generating Knowledge Graphs Through Large Language Model Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15906)
*Jonathan A. Handler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Darth Vecdor' (DV), a tool designed to extract structured knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into SQL knowledge bases to address issues of cost, speed, safety, and accuracy. DV features a user-friendly interface and is open-source, despite limitations and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in querying LLMs directly for knowledge extraction, such as cost, speed, safety, and potential inaccuracies, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Method: The implementation of 'Darth Vecdor' involves extracting LLM-acquired knowledge into a SQL-based knowledge graph, addressing issues such as erroneous or inconsistent responses, and including a browser-based graphical interface for ease of use.

Result: The tool, DV, offers a means to mitigate LLM drawbacks by pre-extracting relevant knowledge into a structured format, making information more accessible and reliable through SQL querying.

Conclusion: While DV has limitations and potential bugs, it presents an open-source solution for leveraging LLM knowledge in structured forms that could benefit specific domains like healthcare, provided it is used cautiously.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.

### [11] [Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922)
*Jovan Pavlović,Miklós Krész,László Hajdu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel RAG framework utilizing the spreading activation algorithm to enhance evidence retrieval via automatically constructed knowledge graphs, improving logical reasoning and multi-step question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems struggle with reliably connecting multi-step evidence for complex reasoning tasks and often disregard varying credibility in retrieved information. GraphRAG systems offer improvements but depend on expensive or often unreliable knowledge graph creation.

Method: A novel framework integrates automatically constructed knowledge graphs with the spreading activation algorithm for better evidence retrieval and reasoning, combined with chain-of-thought processes.

Result: The proposed system improves multi-hop question answering, achieving up to a 39% increase in correctness in resource-constrained settings using small language models.

Conclusion: This framework enhances RAG-based systems' performance with reliable evidence retrieval and reasoning, proving itself effective across diverse setups and providing a modular, integrable solution.

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

### [12] [Small Language Models for Efficient Agentic Tool Calling: Outperforming Large Models with Targeted Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15943)
*Polaris Jhandi,Owais Kazi,Shreyas Subramanian,Neel Sendas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates replacing large language models (LLMs) with optimized small language models (SLMs) for tasks like summarization and query answering. A fine-tuned model achieved significant success, outperforming other benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs and computational inefficiency of Large Language Models in enterprise settings by exploring the potential of resource-efficient Small Language Models.

Method: The paper fine-tuned the facebook/opt-350m model using a single epoch of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) under Hugging Face's TRL framework, applying it to tasks traditionally handled by LLMs.

Result: The fine-tuned small model achieved a 77.55% pass rate in ToolBench evaluation, outperforming other models like ChatGPT-CoT (26.00%) and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27%).

Conclusion: Well-optimized SLMs exhibit significant potential to enable cost-efficient adoption of generative AI, providing comparable performance to LLMs in enterprise workflows.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

### [13] [Conversational Time Series Foundation Models: Towards Explainable and Effective Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16022)
*Defu Cao,Michael Gee,Jinbo Liu,Hengxuan Wang,Wei Yang,Rui Wang,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate, explain, and coordinate an ensemble of time series foundation models for improved forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of a singular superior method among time series models, focusing on the need for an optimal ensemble that is both effective and interpretable.

Method: An R1-style finetuning process using SHAP-based scores is applied to train LLMs, enabling them to assign meaningful causal weights to model ensembles. The LLM then uses iterative conversations for forward-looking assessments and refining strategies.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the GIFT-Eval benchmark across 23 datasets and 97 settings, significantly improving CRPS and MASE metrics.

Conclusion: Repositioning LLMs as intelligent judges for ensemble coordination enhances forecasting performance and interpretability compared to individual foundation models.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

### [14] [Do Large Language Models Know What They Don't Know? Kalshibench: A New Benchmark for Evaluating Epistemic Calibration via Prediction Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16030)
*Lukas Nel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces KalshiBench, a benchmark evaluation for large language models (LLMs) on epistemic calibration through prediction market questions. Results show systematic overconfidence and calibration challenges across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Though LLMs are powerful across various tasks, their ability to effectively match confidence levels with actual accuracy (epistemic calibration) is not well understood. This work probes this ability.

Method: KalshiBench, comprising 300 prediction market questions with outcomes occurring post-training cutoffs, was utilized to assess the epistemic calibration of five state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: All evaluated models showed systematic overconfidence, significant calibration errors, and most performed worse than baseline approaches. Scaling and enhanced reasoning didn't improve calibration.

Conclusion: Epistemic calibration is a distinct capability requiring deliberate development, as scaling and reasoning gains in LLMs do not automatically address calibration issues.

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

*Diane Myung-kyung Woodbridge,Allyson Seba,Freddie Seba,Aydin Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses a system designed to analyze and categorize AI-related policies in academia, promoting safe adoption of GenAI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of clarity and consistency around how generative AI is integrated into academic learning environments.

Method: The authors developed an automated system using unsupervised topic modeling and GPT-4.0 for policy discovery and classification, achieving high precision and recall metrics.

Result: The system successfully identified key policy themes with coherence scores of 0.73 and classified AI policy categories with precision and recall close to 0.92-0.97 and 0.85-0.97, respectively.

Conclusion: The tool provides structured insights into AI-related policies, supporting responsible GenAI use in education and enhancing students' understanding of relevant guidelines.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative art systems have high-dimensional and fragmented parameter spaces where discovering aesthetically pleasing outputs is challenging. The current trial-and-error method leaves many configurations unexplored.

Method: The authors introduced ParamExplorer, which integrates reinforcement learning and allows interactive exploration of parameter spaces in generative art via feedback (manual or automated). They implemented and tested different exploration strategies (agents).

Result: The framework, compatible with p5.js projects, facilitates better exploration than traditional manual methods. Multiple exploration strategies provide flexibility for artists and improved discovery of interesting outputs.

Conclusion: ParamExplorer reduces the reliance on trial-and-error, enhances creative discovery in generative art, and demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning in this domain.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for music recommendation struggle to balance in-depth musical domain knowledge with flexibility in utilizing external tools for accurate and personalized suggestions.

Method: WeMusic-Agent trains large language models to decide between internalized musical knowledge usage and calling specialized tools, with continued pretraining on music data. It also introduces a new benchmark from WeChat Listen for evaluation.

Result: The proposed WeMusic-Agent demonstrates significant improvements in recommendation relevance, personalization, and diversity based on real-world data evaluations.

Conclusion: WeMusic-Agent effectively bridges the gap in personalized conversational music recommendation, leveraging internal knowledge and external tools efficiently, and establishes a strong benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the prohibitive costs of using real API calls for synthetic data generation and to address the lack of multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection in existing pipelines.

Method: ToolForge creates large-scale tool-learning data using a triple (question, golden context, answer) and ensures data quality with a Multi-Layer Validation Framework, employing virtual tools in place of real API calls.

Result: Training a model with only 8B parameters on ToolForge's synthesized data delivers superior performance compared to GPT-4o across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolForge demonstrates effective tool-learning synthesis, ensuring high-quality data while improving accessibility and cost-efficiency. The code and dataset are publicly shared.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the Weighted K-harmonic Means (WKHM) clustering algorithm, focusing on its suitability for wireless networks and establishing its rigorous convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in existing clustering methods for wireless networks by enabling fractional user association and improved load fairness.

Method: Develop the WKHM clustering algorithm integrating inverse-distance weighting for soft clustering and validating convergence under stochastic and deterministic scenarios.

Result: WKHM introduces convergence guarantees for clustering tasks and demonstrates superior performance in signal strength and load fairness across diverse simulations.

Conclusion: The WKHM algorithm is a robust and theoretically grounded approach for clustering in wireless networks, combining enhanced fairness and numerical stability.

Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.

*Jianming Liu,Ren Zhu,Jian Xu,Kun Ding,Xu-Yao Zhang,Gaofeng Meng,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PDE-Agent, a multi-agent, toolchain-augmented system for automated PDE solving directly from natural language descriptions, outperforming existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and PINN approaches to PDE solving require significant domain and expert knowledge; the authors aim to create a fully autonomous method leveraging LLM-driven agents.

Method: PDE-Agent integrates LLM-driven reasoning, external tools, and collaborative multi-agent frameworks with dynamic planning, error correction, and artifact management mechanisms.

Result: PDE-Agent demonstrates superior performance and applicability in solving multi-step, complex PDEs via agent-based tool collaborations, validated through PDE-Bench metrics.

Conclusion: PDE-Agent significantly advances automation in PDE solving, establishing a paradigm shift towards toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration for scientific computing.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: SPRITE addresses limitations in spatial reasoning of VLMs by using simulators and large language models to generate scalable, diverse, and computationally precise datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models which are limited by current rigid or unscalable data generation methods.

Method: SPRITE employs LLMs for generating executable programs from spatial questions and uses simulators to ensure computational precision and verifiability, creating high-quality datasets.

Result: A dataset of 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs was created, leading to significant performance improvements in spatial benchmarks compared to equivalently sized datasets.

Conclusion: SPRITE enhances spatial intelligence by overcoming limitations of template-based methods, showing robust scalability and generalizability. The framework and dataset will be made publicly available for further advancements.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

*Aniruddha Roy,Jyoti Patel,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AlignMerge, a geometry-aware framework for safe merging of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of merging LLMs without impairing alignment or safety, which standard merging techniques inadvertently jeopardize.

Method: The method involves utilizing AlignMerge, which optimizes a merger while maintaining alignment invariants through Fisher geometry and subspace projections.

Result: Across five model families, AlignMerge demonstrates improved alignment metrics, minimal drift, and strong performance compared to current merging techniques.

Conclusion: The study validates AlignMerge as an effective approach for alignment-preserving merging and positions it as a design goal for future foundation models.

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMUSE, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) abilities in agentic tasks like multi-speaker reasoning in audio-visual contexts. It also proposes RAFT, a framework that significantly improves such reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with multi-speaker, dialogue-centric tasks that require agentic reasoning and understanding in complex audio-visual scenarios like conversational assistants and meeting analytics.

Method: The authors developed AMUSE, a benchmark for agentic tasks, and RAFT, a framework combining reward optimization, intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation, and parameter-efficient updates to improve agentic reasoning in MLLMs.

Result: RAFT achieved a relative accuracy improvement of up to 39.52% on the AMUSE benchmark, demonstrating better multi-speaker reasoning and dialogue-centric understanding.

Conclusion: AMUSE and RAFT provide essential tools for testing and enhancing the agentic reasoning capabilities of multimodal models, addressing key limitations in current MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores aligning agent timelines with the physical world by teaching LLMs to predict action latencies, enhancing autonomy in asynchronous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by temporal gaps between action initiation and completion in asynchronous environments.

Method: Utilizing the Code-as-Action paradigm and In-Context Learning to predict waiting durations, allowing agents to align internal clocks with environment timelines.

Result: Experiments in simulated Kubernetes environments show that agents achieve precise temporal calibration, reducing query overhead and execution latency.

Conclusion: Learnable temporal awareness in LLMs is vital for autonomous operation in open-ended environments.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

*Yiliu Yang,Yilei Jiang,Qunzhong Wang,Yingshui Tan,Xiaoyong Zhu,Sherman S. M. Chow,Bo Zheng,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes QuadSentinel, a safety framework using four agents to enforce machine-checkable rules for policy compliance in language model-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety risks of large language model-based agents when handling complex tasks with tools, plans, and communication, where ambiguity in natural language policies leads to ineffective enforcement.

Method: QuadSentinel uses four agents (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, referee) to enforce safety policies as machine-checkable rules, prioritizing checks efficiently through hierarchical conflict resolution.

Result: QuadSentinel demonstrated higher accuracy, better rule recall, and fewer false positives compared to single-agent baselines, measured on specific benchmarks (ST-WebAgentBench and AgentHarm).

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves safety control for language model-based agents while being adaptable to near-term deployments without needing modifications to existing agents.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

TL;DR: This paper introduces OS-Oracle, a framework for addressing step-level decision-making issues in graphical user interface (GUI) navigation by computer-using agents (CUAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing capability of CUAs in GUI navigation faces challenges with reliable step-level decisions, which is crucial for preventing errors and irreversible actions in real-world, long-horizon workflows.

Method: The paper proposes a scalable pipeline for synthesizing critic data, a two-stage training paradigm (SFT and CP-GRPO), and a benchmark (OS-Critic Bench) for assessing critic model performance across platforms.

Result: The OS-Oracle-7B model, built on this framework, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs and surpasses proprietary models in specific domains, while also enhancing GUI agent performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of OS-Oracle in improving GUI decision-making reliability, with open-sourced tools and high-quality datasets supporting its broad applicability.

Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/numbmelon/OS-Oracle.

Result: The experiments demonstrate ForenAgent's ability to achieve advanced tool-usage and reasoning skills in complex IFD tasks, showing its effectiveness in unifying varied information streams.

Conclusion: ForenAgent provides a flexible, interpretable, and effective way of conducting image forgery detection by leveraging both high-level semantic abilities and low-level data tools, paving the way for general-purpose IFD solutions.

Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and clarify the rapidly expanding research landscape of adaptation in agentic AI systems to improve their performance, reliability, and generalization.

Method: A systematic framework is developed to classify adaptation strategies into agent and tool adaptations, with further subdivisions to understand their trade-offs and practical applications. Representative approaches are reviewed, analyzed, and their challenges highlighted.

Result: The authors provide a comprehensive framework to guide adaptation strategy design and implementation in agentic AI systems while identifying their strengths, limitations, and future opportunities.

Conclusion: This paper offers foundational insights and a roadmap for building advanced, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems leveraging adaptive capabilities.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

### [30] [Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317)
*Arther Tian,Alex Ding,Frank Chen,Alan Wu,Aaron Chan,Bruce Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-aware Proof of Quality (PoQ) system for decentralized large language model inference, balancing evaluation quality and computational costs for both inference and evaluator nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues in verifying computations for large language models in decentralized settings while accounting for differences in computational efficiency and cost.

Method: The new framework incorporates efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism using a linear reward function that evaluates normalized quality and cost. It relies on a combination of metrics like token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT-based judgments in a unified evaluation pipeline.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that evaluator architecture impacts output quality. Semantic textual similarity bi-encoders correlate better with ground truth and GPT evaluations than cross-encoders. Quality-cost analyses reveal that larger models are more efficient in terms of quality per unit latency, and a Monte Carlo simulation confirms that the cost-aware reward scheme favors high-quality, low-cost models and penalizes low-quality, inefficient nodes.

Conclusion: The cost-aware PoQ framework offers a viable and sustainable method for decentralized LLM inference, optimizing for both quality and efficiency in its evaluation system.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI is transformative but its measurable impact is still limited beyond a few significant successes; physics may offer more to improve current AI limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess the hype versus real impact of AI, explore the deficiencies of current AI architectures, and propose that physics can significantly contribute to enhancing AI.

Method: Critically reviewing current AI architectures, their limitations, potential directions like quantum AI and providing a roadmap for integrating theory-based rigor with machine learning.

Result: The paper identifies the gaps in current AI such as reliance on enormous meaningless parameters and lack of fundamental scientific reliability, while identifying physics as an area for progress.

Conclusion: 'Big AI,' integrating solid theoretical foundations with machine learning, promises to overcome current AI limitations and advance the field effectively.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.

Motivation: To develop a more effective metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by human decision-making in path construction.

Method: The Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA) mimics human behavior in constructing paths using principles such as path blending, randomness, and iterative learning.

Result: PCIA performed competitively across 53 mathematical and 13 constrained optimization problems compared to traditional and contemporary algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed PCIA showcases practical effectiveness and competitiveness for solving complex optimization problems.

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Synthelite achieves up to 95% success in synthesis tasks with user constraints and ensures chemical feasibility in route design.

Conclusion: Synthelite demonstrates the potential of LLMs as central orchestrators in synthesis planning, enabling flexible and chemist-guided interactions.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SC2BA, a new multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmarking environment focused on algorithm-versus-algorithm evaluation, overcoming limitations of fixed AI opponents in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, MARL algorithms are evaluated against static AI configurations, limiting diversity and comprehensive assessment. This paper aims to improve this by providing a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework.

Method: The authors introduce SC2BA, which allows adversarial comparisons for MARL algorithms through dual-algorithm pairings or multi-algorithm interactions. Additionally, APyMARL interfaces/modules streamline usability.

Result: Benchmark experiments highlight challenges in effectiveness, sensitivity, and scalability of various MARL algorithms within this new adversarial environment.

Conclusion: SC2BA broadens evaluation depths for MARL algorithms, offering a fair, customizable framework, marking advancement in benchmarking development for MARL research.

Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.

Motivation: To address the lack of exploration of LLMs in operational and maintenance tasks for battery energy storage systems (BESS), and to enable better reasoning, predictions, and decisions in these scenarios through structured representation.

Method: The TS2R framework combines segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation to convert raw lithium-ion battery time-series data into structured, enriched natural language reports.

Result: TS2R-enabled LLMs outperform baselines in accuracy, robustness, and explainability across tasks like anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management.

Conclusion: TS2R provides a practical approach for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence, achieving expert-level decision quality and consistency without the need for retraining or model architecture changes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

TL;DR: cuPilot is a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework to optimize CUDA kernels, achieving significant performance improvements over PyTorch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing CUDA kernels is labor-intensive due to proprietary tools and the complexity of hardware-software co-design. Current methods using LLMs and evolutionary algorithms lack optimal designs and representations.

Method: cuPilot employs a multi-agent framework that uses strategy-coordinated evolution, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level initialization for kernel optimization.

Result: Generated kernels by cuPilot lead to a 3.09x average speedup over PyTorch across 100 kernels, and deliver optimal results on GEMM tasks.

Conclusion: cuPilot introduces an effective strategy-coordinated framework for kernel optimization, making significant performance advancements. The open-source kernels are available online.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a metric to ensure simulated environments align causally with real-world behavior in autonomous vehicle testing, rather than just looking visually realistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy of current fidelity measures, which often focus on visual realism and fail to ensure that decision mechanisms align between simulated and real-world environments.

Method: The paper introduces Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a metric that uses explainable AI to compare the causal evidence influencing decisions in simulated and real-world settings. They propose practical estimators and a calibration scheme to improve simulator fidelity.

Result: Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF uncovers key discrepancies missed by conventional fidelity measures while also improving fidelity at multiple levels through DFF-guided calibration.

Conclusion: The research shows that DFF can enhance simulation fidelity by focusing on decision-making mechanisms, leading to improved alignment between simulated and real-world environments, which is critical for AV safety assurance.

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates CPU-only inference for local large language and vision-language models, revealing new computational scaling laws and introducing techniques for energy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how computational resources scale for language and vision-language models on common edge hardware like CPUs, and to identify effective low-power methods for inference in constrained settings.

Method: Benchmarking of large models on CPU-based devices (MacBook Pro M2 and Raspberry Pi 5) with continuous sampling of computational metrics and analysis of input scaling effects. Quantum-inspired compression techniques are also evaluated.

Result: Two scaling laws were identified: (1) linear computational scaling with token length for language models, and (2) a resolution clamp effect in vision-language models. Compression methods reduced computation, memory, and energy usage significantly while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Efficient model compression and input-resolution preprocessing are viable solutions for sustainable edge inference, offering clear computational and energy advantages for local language and vision-language tasks on CPUs.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how memory-enhanced personalization in AI agents using LLMs can introduce and amplify bias, and suggests protective measures for mitigating these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address unexplored risks of bias introduced by memory-enhanced personalized AI agents, despite their benefits in improving interaction and relevance over time.

Method: The authors simulate recruitment scenarios using memory-enhanced personalized agents powered by safety-trained LLMs to examine bias in various operational stages.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that bias is systematically introduced and amplified in agents through personalization, despite using safety-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Memory-enhanced personalization in LLM-based AI agents can lead to bias, highlighting an urgent need for additional safeguards or protective mechanisms to address these issues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on complex reasoning but fail to address ambiguous, exploratory queries where relevance, not a single factual answer, is the goal.

Method: The benchmark involves 663 questions across seven domains, crafted with controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web content. The authors tested various LLMs and search agents on this dataset.

Result: Most models showed poor performance, achieving below 35% accuracy, with none consistently performing well across domains or challenge levels.

Conclusion: Current search systems struggle with effectively handling exploratory, ambiguous queries, highlighting the need for advancements in fuzzy retrieval techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

*Jirui Yang,Hengqi Guo,Zhihui Lu,Yi Zhao,Yuansen Zhang,Shijing Hu,Qiang Duan,Yinggui Wang,Tao Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prefix Probing is a new black-box harmful content detection method that uses conditional log-probabilities and prefix caching to enable fast and cost-efficient detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost for large language models in safety-critical contexts.

Method: The method calculates conditional log-probabilities of specific prefixes and uses a cache to minimize detection latency.

Result: Prefix Probing achieves detection performance comparable to external safety models while greatly reducing computational overhead and costs.

Conclusion: Prefix Probing is practical and efficient, offering a low-cost and high-speed solution for identifying harmful content without requiring extra model deployment.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

*Sri Yash Tadimalla,Justin Cary,Gordon Hull,Jordan Register,Daniel Maxwell,David Pugalee,Tina Heafner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper calls for a shift in AI literacy, emphasizing human agency for intentional and critical decision-making about AI, beyond just operational skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current educational frameworks fail to address the critical and ethical reasoning about AI, causing a dangerous literacy gap.

Method: Introduces AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks to empower educators and students to critically engage with AI.

Result: Provides pathways for articulating informed decisions about AI’s role in academic, career, and societal contexts.

Conclusion: Comprehensive AI literacy should focus on human agency, emphasizing technology as a conscious choice, supported by critical thinking and epistemology.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores automating thematic grouping of hadith using the Apriori algorithm to find meaningful semantic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to automate text analysis of Islamic texts in the era of digitalization.

Method: The study applies the Apriori algorithm on preprocessed data of the Indonesian Translation of Bukhari hadith, focusing on association rule mining.

Result: Meaningful semantic patterns such as themes of worship, revelations, and hadith narration are detected.

Conclusion: The Apriori algorithm is effective for discovering latent semantic relationships, supporting advancements in digital Islamic studies.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the advantages of multi-agent design versus single-agent approaches for solving diagram-grounded geometry problems using multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether multi-agent pipelines enhance the performance of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on visual math benchmarks.

Method: The study systematically compares the performance of single-agent and multi-agent pipelines using open-source and closed-source models across four benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math.

Result: Multi-agent pipelines consistently improve open-source model performance (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL gains significant points across benchmarks), while closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash performs better in single-agent mode, with limited improvements on newer datasets like We-Math.

Conclusion: Multi-agent pipelines are advantageous for open-source models and may assist strong proprietary systems on unfamiliar benchmarks, but their effectiveness is not universal across all scenarios.

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

TL;DR: The paper presents Cyber Humanism in Education as a framework addressing the integration of GenAI in learning environments, emphasizing human agency and presenting case studies to operationalize these ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing integration of GenAI in education raises concerns over epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the diminishing professional role of educators.

Method: The authors propose a Cyber Humanism framework with three design pillars: reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, and dialogic design, and apply these concepts through higher-education case studies such as prompt-based learning and educator certification.

Result: Findings demonstrate enhanced epistemic agency while highlighting tensions related to workload, equity, and governance in AI-integrated education environments.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need to harness human-centred approaches in AI-rich learning environments, suggesting Cyber Humanism as a viable design framework while addressing challenges for educators and learners.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.

TL;DR: The paper studies two computational limitations on algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability, and their implications on self-analysis and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental constraints on reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in algorithmic intelligent systems.

Method: Formal analysis of computational and deductive limits using theoretical frameworks to explore how these constraints interplay.

Result: The paper shows that an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon universally, linking reasoning to predictive limitations.

Conclusion: Structural limitations restrict intelligent agents, highlighting trade-offs between prediction, reasoning, and introspection capabilities.

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

Result: Theoretical results demonstrate soundness, completeness, and convergence. Empirical results show the method efficiently models capabilities for multiple BBAI systems.

Conclusion: PDDL-style representations and Monte-Carlo tree search can accurately and efficiently model black-box AI planning capabilities, ensuring safer and interpretable operations.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline to predict pain episodes in lung cancer patients within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer patients often experience breakthrough pain that requires timely intervention. Current approaches lack the ability to predict and proactively manage such pain episodes effectively.

Method: The study utilized a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline, analyzing both structured and unstructured electronic health record data from a retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients.

Result: The framework achieved high accuracy (0.874 within 48 hours, 0.917 within 72 hours) and increased sensitivity (8.6% at 48h and 10.4% at 72h) due to large language model integration.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable and interpretable tool for early pain episode prediction, potentially improving oncology care through enhanced treatment and resource allocation.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CitySeeker, a benchmark to test Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) spatial reasoning and navigation based on implicit human needs in dynamic urban scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs succeed in instruction-based tasks but lack capabilities in understanding implicit human requirements (e.g., "I’m thirsty") for real-world navigation, especially in urban contexts.

Method: CitySeeker provides a dataset of 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities in 7 goal-driven scenarios to evaluate VLMs under diverse implicit needs. The paper also explores strategies like Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR).

Result: Top-performing VLMs achieve only 21.1% task completion in this benchmark, revealing challenges such as error accumulation, spatial reasoning deficiencies, and limited memory-based recall.

Conclusion: Actionable strategies inspired by human cognitive behaviors are essential to improve VLMs' spatial intelligence and ability to address implicit urban navigation challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

TL;DR: TOGGLE introduces a novel approach for compressing large language models using Signal Temporal Logic, achieving significant reductions in computational costs and model size while preserving linguistic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices, focusing on preserving linguistic properties during compression while overcoming the limitations of existing methods.

Method: The TOGGLE framework employs Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for formal specification of linguistic properties, combined with Bayesian optimization to explore layer-wise compression configurations without retraining.

Result: TOGGLE achieved up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs and up to 68.8% reduction in model size across multiple architectures, while satisfying specified linguistic constraints.

Conclusion: TOGGLE pioneers the application of formal methods in LLM compression, enabling efficient and verifiable deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for focusing on "patchwork AGI" - a scenario where AGI emerges through the coordination of sub-AGI agents, proposing a framework for distributional AGI safety using regulated virtual economies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored safety challenges of scenarios where AGI capabilities emerge from coordinated sub-AGI agents rather than a single monolithic AGI.

Method: Developing a framework for distributional AGI safety based on virtual agentic sandbox economies, employing market mechanisms, auditability, reputation systems, and oversight.

Result: Proposed a new model for AGI safety that adapts traditional alignment ideas for distributed systems of AI agents rather than individual ones.

Conclusion: Patchwork AGI scenarios demand serious attention, and designing safeguards like sandboxed economic frameworks can mitigate risks arising from collective AI agent behaviors.

Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer system to embed societal values into AI systems, integrating safeguards and feedback mechanisms to ensure ethical validation in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between the theoretical principles of responsible AI and the lack of practical or enforceable tools to integrate these principles throughout the lifecycle of socio-technical AI systems.

Method: The SRS framework embeds societal values as constraints and safeguards within AI systems. It models responsibility as a supervisory control problem, using closed-loop monitoring and a unified constraint-based approach with run-time feedback to enforce fairness and ethical concerns.

Result: SRS effectively operationalized societal values across several case studies, including clinical decision support, autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems, showing successful enforcement of fairness and explanation quality.

Conclusion: SRS provides a scalable, practical approach to ensuring ethically accountable AI systems by combining ethics, control theory, and governance into socio-technical designs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an adversarial framework to improve reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), focusing on mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address process errors like incorrect calculations and brittle logic in LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces an adversarial reinforcement learning system where an LLM reasoner and LLM-based discriminator co-evolve, assessing logical soundness and assigning rewards via structured justifications.

Result: Achieves improved performance on mathematical benchmarks, increasing reasoning quality with notable gains in metrics on tasks like AIME24.

Conclusion: Generative Adversarial Reasoner enhances reasoning in LLMs, enabling modular adjustments for diverse reasoning objectives such as proof-based reasoning or teacher distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

*FNU Vikas,Paul Gratz,Daniel Jiménez*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces new identifiers—branch working set size and branch predictability—to analyze and improve branch prediction accuracy, categorizing 2,451 workloads based on these metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern conditional branch predictors, such as TAGE and perceptron, aim to minimize instruction mispredictions for better performance and energy efficiency. However, a deeper understanding of factors influencing predictor accuracy is needed.

Method: The authors define branch working sets (frequently occurring branch contexts) and introduce metrics for working set size and predictability. They analyze these metrics across 2,451 workload traces to correlate them with predictor accuracy.

Result: The study categorized workloads into seven working set size groups and nine predictability groups, uncovering connections between these factors and modern branch prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics provide insights into branch prediction behavior, allowing for better alignment between workload characteristics and predictor designs.

Abstract: Conditional branch prediction predicts the likely direction of a conditional branch instruction to support ILP extraction. Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive system architecture for a wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), using design space exploration and system modeling to examine power and complexity constraints.

Result: The study demonstrates the importance of system-wide optimization in wearable contextual AI systems, as no single component dominates system power, requiring careful design to avoid bottlenecks.

Conclusion: An end-to-end system-level approach is crucial for designing efficient, power-optimized wearable devices capable of supporting all-day contextual AI systems, paving the way for innovative AI applications.

Abstract: The next generation of human-oriented computing will require always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices to capture egocentric vision and functional primitives (e.g., Where am I? What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems.

*Tejas Anvekar,Juhna Park,Aparna Garimella,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TabReX offers a reference-less method to evaluate tables generated by large language models by utilizing graph-based reasoning and canonical knowledge graphs for enhanced accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating tables generated by LLMs face challenges, such as ignoring table structure or relying on fixed references, limiting their effectiveness and generalization.

Method: TabReX converts source text and tables into knowledge graphs, aligns them using LLM-guided matching, computes rubric-based scores, and introduces TabReX-Bench benchmarking framework.

Result: TabReX achieves high correlation with expert rankings, robustness against perturbations, and fine-grained analysis capabilities in benchmarking evaluation across multiple domains.

Conclusion: TabReX establishes a new paradigm for trustworthy and explainable evaluation of structured generation, ensuring accurate and human-aligned metric assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of tables generated by large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge: existing metrics either flatten tables into text, ignoring structure, or rely on fixed references that limit generalization. We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems.

*Joel Mire,Maria Antoniak,Steven R. Wilson,Zexin Ma,Achyutarama R. Ganti,Andrew Piper,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SocialStoryFrames, a computational framework for analyzing nuanced reader responses to stories using narrative theory and a social context-driven dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current computational models of reader response, which cannot fully capture nuanced interpretive, affective, and evaluative reactions to storytelling.

Method: The authors developed two models: SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, leveraging a narrative theory-based taxonomy and conversational contexts. They validated the models with human surveys and expert reviews.

Result: Pilot analyses demonstrated the models' ability to analyze storytelling intents and narrative diversity in a dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts.

Conclusion: SocialStoryFrames provides a framework to study storytelling practices in online communities, advancing research into narrative interpretation, writer intent, and reader engagement.

Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in token usage and reasoning accuracy in large language models, particularly within production systems.

Method: The study evaluates BRAID's structured approach using machine-readable prompts and Mermaid-based instruction graphs across multiple GPT tiers and datasets.

Result: Structured prompts via BRAID improved cost efficiency and reasoning accuracy for GPT models on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: BRAID demonstrates its effectiveness and scalability for optimizing reasoning processes in autonomous language agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit nonlinear relationships between performance, cost, and token usage. This paper presents a quantitative study on structured prompting using BRAID (Bounded Reasoning for Au tonomous Inference and Decisions) across multiple GPT model tiers, eval uated on the AdvancedIF, GSM-Hard, and the SCALE MultiChallenge benchmark datasets. BRAID introduces a bounded reasoning framework using Mermaid-based instruction graphs that enable models to reason struc turally rather than through unbounded natural-language token expansion. We show that structured machine-readable prompts substantially increase reasoning accuracy and cost efficiency for agents in production systems. The findings establish BRAID as an effective and scalable technique for optimizing inference efficiency in autonomous agent systems.

*Kieran Henderson,Kian Omoomi,Vasudha Varadarajan,Allison Lahnala,Charles Welch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of different types of personal information for predicting annotator labels in social norms tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore what kind of personal information is most valuable for modeling individual characteristics and predicting subjective annotator labels.

Method: Self-disclosure sentences were categorized and used to build models for predicting judgments of social norms. Ablations and analyses were performed to assess the impact of various information types.

Result: Demographics had the most significant impact, while attitudes, relationships, and experiences were less impactful. Theory-based approaches outperformed automatic clustering, requiring fewer related comments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that diverse self-disclosures enable the best performance in annotator prediction models, with demographic information being the most effective.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of personal information in the form of persona sentences or self-disclosures to improve modeling of individual characteristics and prediction of annotator labels for subjective tasks. The volume of personal information has historically been restricted and thus little exploration has gone into understanding what kind of information is most informative for predicting annotator labels. In this work, we categorize self-disclosure sentences and use them to build annotator models for predicting judgments of social norms. We perform several ablations and analyses to examine the impact of the type of information on our ability to predict annotation patterns. We find that demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Generally, theory-based approaches worked better than automatic clusters. Contrary to previous work, only a small number of related comments are needed. Lastly, having a more diverse sample of annotator self-disclosures leads to the best performance.

### [64] [Are We on the Right Way to Assessing LLM-as-a-Judge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16041)
*Yuanning Feng,Sinan Wang,Zhengxiang Cheng,Yao Wan,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sage, a novel evaluation suite assessing LLM-as-a-Judge quality without human annotation, revealing significant reliability issues in top-performing LLMs and proposing methods to improve consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases, scalability constraints, and reliability issues posed by traditional human-annotated benchmarks in evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge.

Method: The proposed method, Sage, evaluates LLM judges using two criteria: local self-consistency (preference stability) and global logical consistency (preference transitivity), tested on a dataset of 650 questions.

Result: Sage metrics showed high correlation with existing supervised benchmarks, revealed significant reliability issues in top models like GPT-5, and highlighted the phenomenon of situational preference.

Conclusion: Human annotations are unreliable as gold standards, but techniques like finetuning, panel-based judging, and explicit criteria can improve LLM consistency and performance.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.

*Daniela N. Rim,Heeyoul Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lie Convolutions in sentence classification models, outperforming traditional CNN-based approaches by capturing complex non-Euclidean transformations in language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of convolutional models to integrate complex, non-Euclidean transformations in language modeling.

Method: Introduces Lie Convolutions into convolutional sentence classifiers, resulting in SCLie and DPCLie models.

Result: SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional convolution-based sentence classifiers in accuracy.

Conclusion: Lie-based convolutional models improve upon traditional approaches, revealing potential for better capturing transformations in language.

Abstract: Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks have been successful in capturing local, position-invariant features in text, but their capacity to model complex transformation within language can be further explored. In this work, we explore a novel approach by integrating Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, inspired by the ability of Lie group operations to capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries. Our proposed models SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, suggesting that Lie-based models relatively improve the accuracy by capturing transformations not commonly associated with language. Our findings motivate more exploration of new paradigms in language modeling.

### [66] [MRG-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Clinically Aligned Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16145)
*Pengyu Wang,Shuchang Ye,Usman Naseem,Jinman Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method to improve the clinical correctness of medical report generation (MRG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical report generation methods lack clinical correctness due to being trained on token-level objectives, which prioritize language style over medical accuracy.

Method: The proposed SRL method uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and optimizes report-level rewards based on a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) between generated and reference reports. A reasoning format constraint is also implemented to structure the outputs.

Result: MRG-R1, the method applying SRL, achieved state-of-the-art clinical efficacy metrics with CE-F1 scores of 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR, proving its effectiveness over conventional token-level approaches.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the benefit of optimizing clinically grounded report-level rewards over token-level supervision, contributing to better medical correctness in large vision-language model training.

Abstract: Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying `Faux-Hate,` a blend of hate speech and fake narratives, in code-mixed Hindi-English text from social media, and to better understand its target and severity.

Method: The system uses advanced natural language processing techniques combined with domain-specific pretraining and applies multi-task learning to detect and categorize Faux-Hate.

Result: The approach achieved competitive results in the shared task of identifying Faux-Hate and its associated attributes in social media text.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that combining multi-task learning and domain-specific pretraining is effective in tackling the complex issues of mixed hate speech and fake narratives in social media.

Abstract: Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in extracting structured information from variable and informal police incident announcements, critical for accurate data processing in social science research.

Method: A fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and targeted prompt engineering was developed to handle noisy, heterogeneous text and extract 15 fields with high accuracy.

Result: The pipeline achieved over 98.36% accuracy for mortality detection, and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% and 95.54% for fatality counts and province-level locations, respectively, using data from social media posts.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively transforms unstructured text into reliable structured data, offering a validated and efficient tool for information extraction in specialized domains.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from police incident announcements is crucial for timely and accurate data processing, yet presents considerable challenges due to the variability and informal nature of textual sources such as social media posts. To address these challenges, we developed a domain-adapted extraction pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020). Experimental results demonstrated that LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly improved performance over both the base and instruction-tuned models, achieving an accuracy exceeding 98.36% for mortality detection and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% for fatality counts and 95.54% for province-level location extraction. The proposed pipeline thus provides a validated and efficient solution for multi-task structured information extraction in specialized domains, offering a practical framework for transforming unstructured text into reliable structured data in social science research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fact-checking module independent of LLM along with a domain-specific summarization model fine-tuned on healthcare data to address hallucinations in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability and accuracy in LLM-generated outputs in healthcare, especially for patient safety and decision-making.

Method: The method involves pairing a fine-tuned domain-specific summarization model (using LoRa on MIMIC III dataset) with a fact-checking module that validates facts through numerical and logical checks against EHRs.

Result: The fact-checking module achieves precision (0.8904), recall (0.8234), and F1-score (0.8556). The LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score (0.5797) and BERTScore (0.9120).

Conclusion: The proposed combination improves the accuracy and reliability of LLM-generated outputs, enhancing their utility in healthcare applications.

Abstract: In healthcare, it is essential for any LLM-generated output to be reliable and accurate, particularly in cases involving decision-making and patient safety. However, the outputs are often unreliable in such critical areas due to the risk of hallucinated outputs from the LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a fact-checking module that operates independently of any LLM, along with a domain-specific summarization model designed to minimize hallucination rates. Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs). We trained the LLM model on the full MIMIC-III dataset. For evaluation of the fact-checking module, we sampled 104 summaries, extracted them into 3,786 propositions, and used these as facts. The fact-checking module achieves a precision of 0.8904, a recall of 0.8234, and an F1-score of 0.8556. Additionally, the LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120 for summary quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the accuracy and safe deployment of LLMs is challenging due to errors or outdated information. Current techniques often fail to generalize corrections and produce unintended consequences.

Method: The proposed framework leverages the information bottleneck theory to compress essential knowledge for corrections while minimizing disruptions to unrelated model behaviors. IBKE uses compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates.

Result: IBKE demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, generality, and specificity in model editing tasks across diverse LLM architectures and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This paper offers a practical and theoretically sound paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing in LLMs, enhancing their utility and trustworthiness in varied applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoPA, a training-free algorithm to optimize decoding efficiency in diffusion large language models (dLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current confidence-driven decoding strategies for dLLMs have limited parallelism, constraining their speed and efficiency in token generation.

Method: The method, LoPA, identifies better Token Filling Orders (TFOs) through parallel exploration and branch confidence analysis, thereby accelerating inference. It also introduces a multi-device inference system with branch parallelism.

Result: LoPA improves decoding rates significantly, achieving 10.1 tokens per forward pass (TPF) on GSM8K, and boosts throughput to 1073.9 tokens/second in multi-GPU setups.

Conclusion: LoPA enhances parallelism and inference speed for dLLMs while maintaining performance, showcasing its potential for efficient large-scale model deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for high-speed inference. However, current confidence-driven decoding strategies are constrained by limited parallelism, typically achieving only 1--3 tokens per forward pass (TPF). In this work, we identify that the degree of parallelism during dLLM inference is highly sensitive to the Token Filling Order (TFO). Then, we introduce Lookahead PArallel Decoding LoPA, a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm, to identify a superior TFO and hence accelerate inference. LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence. We apply LoPA to the state-of-the-art D2F model and observe a substantial enhancement in decoding efficiency. Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline. Furthermore, to facilitate this unprecedented degree of parallelism, we develop a specialized multi-device inference system featuring Branch Parallelism (BP), which achieves a single-sample throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second under multi-GPU deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sigma-MoE-Tiny, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 20 billion total parameters but activates only 0.5 billion per token. It demonstrates efficient scalability and top-tier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalable and efficient language modeling using extremely sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, capable of achieving high performance with reduced active parameters.

Method: Sigma-MoE-Tiny incorporates fine-grained expert segmentation (96 experts per layer, 1 active expert per token) and introduces a progressive sparsification schedule to address expert load balancing issues. It is pre-trained on a diverse corpus with post-training optimizations.

Result: Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance rivaling much larger models while activating only 0.5 billion parameters. The training process is stable, with no irrecoverable loss spikes.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility of highly sparse MoE models with effective load balancing. The findings provide insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for foundation models due to its efficient and powerful scalability. In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

Method: The authors devised a method to discover adversarial hub texts in discrete text space that are evaluated consistently as high-quality by neural evaluation metrics (e.g., COMET), irrespective of the test data.

Result: The proposed method found hub texts that achieved 79.1% and 67.8% COMET scores for English-to-Japanese and English-to-German tasks respectively, surpassing translations of individual sentences created by a general translation model. These texts also generalized well across other language pairs.

Conclusion: Embedding-based evaluation metrics like COMET have critical vulnerabilities as shown by adversarial hub texts that yield consistently high scores. This raises questions about their current robustness and application validity, thus highlighting areas for further improvement.

Abstract: Strongly human-correlated evaluation metrics serve as an essential compass for the development and improvement of generation models and must be highly reliable and robust. Recent embedding-based neural text evaluation metrics, such as COMET for translation tasks, are widely used in both research and development fields. However, there is no guarantee that they yield reliable evaluation results due to the black-box nature of neural networks. To raise concerns about the reliability and safety of such metrics, we propose a method for finding a single adversarial text in the discrete space that is consistently evaluated as high-quality, regardless of the test cases, to identify the vulnerabilities in evaluation metrics. The single hub text found with our method achieved 79.1 COMET% and 67.8 COMET% in the WMT'24 English-to-Japanese (En--Ja) and English-to-German (En--De) translation tasks, respectively, outperforming translations generated individually for each source sentence by using M2M100, a general translation model. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the hub text found with our method generalizes across multiple language pairs such as Ja--En and De--En.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks SpeechLLMs, which integrate speech as a native modality, against traditional cascaded systems for speech-to-text translation across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether SpeechLLMs enhance speech-to-text translation quality compared to established cascaded pipelines.

Method: A comprehensive test suite assesses 5 SpeechLLMs and 16 direct/cascade systems across 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and various challenging speech conditions.

Result: Cascaded systems consistently perform better overall, with SpeechLLMs matching performance in limited cases, and standalone speech foundation models (SFMs) underperforming.

Conclusion: While LLM integration improves quality, cascaded systems remain more reliable for high-quality speech-to-text translation in most scenarios.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenges of deploying Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in clinical settings by using a privacy-preserving adaptation framework, achieving notable improvements in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance ASR's utility in digitizing clinical documentation, which is hindered by technical barriers like data privacy, computational resource limits, and acoustic domain shifts.

Method: The authors propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for continual learning on edge devices to secure patient data and integrate multi-domain experience replay to reduce catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The proposed framework achieved a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on clinical audio and reduced catastrophic forgetting by 47%.

Conclusion: Their approach demonstrates a practical and efficient way to create reliable, privacy-focused ASR systems suitable for challenging clinical settings.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments.

Motivation: To enhance health literacy through simplification of biomedical texts using advanced LLMs.

Method: The study developed and tested several approaches (prompt templates, AI-agent collaboration, fine-tuning) using gpt-4o models with varied evaluation metrics, both quantitative and qualitative.

Result: gpt-4o-mini performed best, fine-tuning approaches underperformed, and G-Eval metric aligned well with qualitative ratings.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate potential in text simplification for health context, with gpt-4o-mini standing out, but fine-tuning approaches need improvement.

Abstract: This study investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying biomedical texts to enhance health literacy. Using a public dataset, which included plain language adaptations of biomedical abstracts, we developed and evaluated several approaches, specifically a baseline approach using a prompt template, a two AI agent approach, and a fine-tuning approach. We selected OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini models as baselines for further research. We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric.

Motivation: To improve accessibility and comprehensibility of scientific texts through sentence and document-level simplifications.

Method: Comparison of no-context (using prompt engineering) and fine-tuned approaches with OpenAI's GPT models (gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano).

Result: The no-context method using gpt-4.1-mini performed robustly on both sentence and document levels, while fine-tuned models had mixed performance but gpt-4.1-nano-ft excelled in one document-level case.

Conclusion: Simplifying scientific texts at different levels involves significant challenges; however, certain approaches like no-context gpt-4.1-mini show promise.

Abstract: This work describes our submission to the CLEF 2025 SimpleText track Task 1, addressing both sentenceand document-level simplification of scientific texts. The methodology centered on using the gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1mini, and gpt-4.1-nano models from OpenAI. Two distinct approaches were compared: a no-context method relying on prompt engineering and a fine-tuned (FT) method across models. The gpt-4.1-mini model with no-context demonstrated robust performance at both levels of simplification, while the fine-tuned models showed mixed results, highlighting the complexities of simplifying text at different granularities, where gpt-4.1-nano-ft performance stands out at document-level simplification in one case.

*Iker García-Ferrero,David Montero,Roman Orus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Refusal Steering, a method for fine-grained, inference-time control of large language models' (LLMs) refusal behavior on politically sensitive topics without retraining. It removes refusals while maintaining safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for controllable and transparent moderation on politically sensitive topics in large language models, especially without retraining or safety compromises.

Method: The proposed method replaces pattern-based refusal detection with a scoring system using an LLM-as-a-judge. A ridge-regularized steering vector is computed to isolate the refusal-compliance direction, enabling modifications to the model's behavior at inference time.

Result: Refusal Steering successfully reduced refusals on politically sensitive topics in 4B to 80B models. It maintained safety on harmful content and near-baseline performance across benchmarks, while enabling targeted refusals when necessary.

Conclusion: Activation steering is effective in offering nuanced and controllable moderation of refusal behavior in LLMs, ensuring transparency and safety while maintaining performance and adaptability.

Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JustRL, a minimal reinforcement learning approach for large language models with fixed hyperparameters, achieving state-of-the-art results while using significantly less computing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if the growing complexity in reinforcement learning techniques for large language models is truly necessary.

Method: A single-stage training framework with stable fixed hyperparameters applied to reasoning models in a large mathematical benchmark.

Result: JustRL achieved state-of-the-art performance with 54.9% and 64.3% average accuracy across mathematical benchmarks while using 2x fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: Complex multi-stage methods may not be necessary; simpler approaches like JustRL offer robust, transferable performance without additional tricks or complex designs.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GinSign, a framework that translates natural language into temporal logic by accurately grounding NL specifications to system signatures, achieving high logical equivalence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable engineers to bypass manual formal specifications and enhance NL-to-TL translation for trustworthy autonomous systems, addressing limitations in current frameworks.

Method: GinSign uses a hierarchical decomposition approach for grounding NL spans into system signatures. It employs smaller masked language models, avoiding expensive large language models, while offering structured classification for task prediction.

Result: GinSign achieves logical-equivalence scores of 95.5%, outperforming previous methods by 1.4 times and supporting effective downstream model checking.

Conclusion: The GinSign framework improves grounded NL-to-TL translation accuracy, providing engineers with reliable tools for system behavior specification.

Abstract: Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

TL;DR: The paper enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing a reasoning-trace-augmented framework to address conflicts in retrieved sources, with substantial performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues of conflicting, outdated, or subjective information in current RAG systems, which lack unified reasoning mechanisms.

Method: A reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework is developed with three stages: document-level adjudication, conflict analysis, and grounded synthesis. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline evaluates reasoning quality using an LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: The framework significantly improved performance metrics, such as End-to-End answer correctness and behavioral adherence, particularly with the Qwen model.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a foundation for more reliable and interpretable conflict-aware RAG systems, demonstrated by substantial experimental gains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) for biomedical QA, comparing methods to convert visuals to text versus using OCR-free visual retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal pipeline for grounded biomedical QA in visually dense fields like glycobiology, balancing the trade-off between converting figures/tables to text and utilizing visual retrieval without OCR.

Method: The study applied four augmentation approaches (None, Text RAG, Multi-modal, and OCR-free ColPali) across open-source and proprietary models, tested on a benchmark of 120 MCQs from 25 papers, and evaluated for accuracy across configurations.

Result: With mid-size models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT), Text and Multi-modal outperform OCR-free retrieval in accuracy (~0.72-0.74 vs. 0.51). For frontier models (e.g., GPT-4o and GPT-5 family), all methods show competitive performance (~0.828 accuracy with some retrievers statistically indistinguishable).

Conclusion: Pipeline choice depends on model capacity: converting visuals to text advantages smaller models, while frontier models perform equally well with OCR-free approaches like ColFlor, which is efficient and offers parity with heavier options.

Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) promises grounded biomedical QA, but it is unclear when to (i) convert figures/tables into text versus (ii) use optical character recognition (OCR)-free visual retrieval that returns page images and leaves interpretation to the generator. We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT) framework to improve natural language to temporal logic translation, reducing complexity through restricted vocabulary outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve challenges in translating natural language to temporal logic, particularly accurate lifting, co-references handling, and learning from limited data.

Method: The proposed GraFT framework simplifies translation tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens step-by-step and leverages problem-specific properties to reduce solution complexity, supported by theoretical justifications.

Result: Evaluation on CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks shows that GraFT improves end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain accuracy by 14.06% on average compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GraFT effectively addresses limitations in NL-to-TL translation by improving learning efficiency and translation accuracy through solution space reduction.

Abstract: Translating natural language (NL) into a formal language such as temporal logic (TL) is integral for human communication with robots and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.

*Aditya Yadavalli,Tiago Pimentel,Tamar I Regev,Ethan Wilcox,Alex Warstadt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an information-theoretic method to measure the information conveyed by speech prosody compared to text, focusing on dimensions like sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prosody expresses critical communication information that text alone cannot fully capture, but quantifying and understanding its contribution remains a challenge.

Method: Large speech and language models are used to estimate mutual information between meaning dimensions (e.g., sarcasm, emotion, questionhood) and communication channels (audio vs text).

Result: Results show that prosody (audio channel) conveys significantly more information about sarcasm and emotion than text alone, but relatively less about questionhood.

Conclusion: The prosodic channel plays a crucial role in conveying specific dimensions of meaning; further research should explore its role across other communication contexts and languages.

Abstract: Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMCache, a layer-wise caching framework designed to optimize transformer-based model inference speeds while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of high inference latency in transformer-based language models, which limits their use in real-time and large-scale applications.

Method: The authors developed LLMCache, a novel caching mechanism that reuses intermediate activations across encoder and decoder transformer layers using semantic similarity matching and lightweight fingerprinting for efficient input pairing.

Result: LLMCache achieved up to 3.1X speedup in inference time on models like BERT and GPT-2 across tasks such as SQuAD and WikiText-103, with less than 0.5% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMCache is a practical, model-agnostic, and effective solution for enhancing the efficiency of transformer inference in real-world applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) using search engines can face challenges with cost, exposure to poor content, or hallucination. AdaSearch proposes an RL framework improving adaptive balance between internal knowledge and external search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently balance LLMs' reliance on internal knowledge and external search to avoid costs, risks, and overuse while ensuring necessary outcomes.

Method: AdaSearch introduces a transparent two-stage RL framework prioritizing problem-solving and explicit decision-making about invoking search.

Result: AdaSearch improves self-knowledge awareness, reduces unnecessary search, maintains task performance, and produces interpretable decision-making.

Conclusion: The framework advances adaptive search usage and knowledge-boundary awareness, highlighting its importance in sensitive applications like finance or healthcare.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB2, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate reward models (RMs) for multimodal understanding and interleaved image-text generation, testing 23 models across 21 tasks with expert-reviewed preference pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of benchmarks for reward models tailored to multimodal tasks, which combine image and text understanding and generation.

Method: The authors developed MMRB2, a benchmark spanning four multimodal tasks with challenging prompts, outputs from modern models, and expert-annotated preference pairs built through ensemble filtering. They evaluated models' performances using this benchmark.

Result: The results show that human experts outperform models (>90% accuracy), while the best-performing proprietary (Gemini 3 Pro) and open-source models (Qwen3-VL-32B) achieve 75-80% and 64% accuracy, respectively. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved 66-75%.

Conclusion: MMRB2 provides a robust benchmark that reveals the gaps in multimodal reward model abilities, particularly for interleaved tasks, and offers insight into directions for improvement. This benchmark allows for better evaluation and development of multimodal models.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers learn mechanisms to solve arithmetic tasks using variable tokens with context-dependent meanings, achieving near-perfect accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers develop reasoning mechanisms under challenging conditions where token meanings are dynamic and context-dependent.

Method: Researchers created a task with variable token meanings, designed data distributions for causal testing, and identified learned mechanisms through analysis.

Result: Transformers successfully learned three reasoning mechanisms: commutative copying, identity element recognition, and closure-based cancellation, achieving near-perfect task accuracy.

Conclusion: Models adopt symbolic reasoning mechanisms and complement geometric representations when trained on challenging tasks with dynamic token meanings.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms that arise when transformers are trained to solve arithmetic on sequences where tokens are variables whose meaning is determined only through their interactions. While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed.

*Nikhil Prakash,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method named Constructive Circuit Amplification to improve LLM reasoning by selectively updating sparse model components, increasing accuracy while preserving general abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by prior findings indicating that sparse subnetworks (circuits) in LLMs execute specific tasks, and fine-tuning strengthens these circuits to enhance performance.

Method: The method identifies pivotal tokens and associated model components responsible for a task and selectively updates them, focusing on improving mathematical reasoning.

Result: Constructive Circuit Amplification improved mathematical reasoning accuracy by up to 11.4%, modifying only 1.59% of model components. Other abilities were minimally impacted.

Conclusion: Focused interventions on sparse circuits can reliably enhance targeted capabilities without compromising the broader model performance.

Abstract: Prior studies investigating the internal workings of LLMs have uncovered sparse subnetworks, often referred to as circuits, that are responsible for performing specific tasks. Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data augmentation framework combining rule-based mask warping with GAN-based image translation for better masked face detection and recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity and distribution shift in masked face detection and recognition by creating more realistic training samples.

Method: A two-step data augmentation framework combining rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, alongside a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection.

Result: Qualitative improvements in masked face sample generation, complementing existing methods, and enhanced training diversity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively generates realistic masked face samples and suggests potential advancements in data-centric augmentation methods for face recognition.

Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Pier Luigi Dovesi,Shaghayegh Roohi,Mark Granroth-Wilding,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JARVIS is a framework designed to improve visual reasoning in multimodal large language models by incorporating self-supervised learning based on the I-JEPA paradigm, addressing existing limitations in vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to overcome the limitations of MLLMs in visual reasoning tasks, which arise from their reliance on incomplete supervisory signals from textual descriptions and insufficient scales of multimodal instruction tuning. Current models tend to overfit language priors while neglecting visual details.

Method: The proposed method, JARVIS, incorporates the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the vision-language alignment pipeline. It employs frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders and trains the predictor (implemented through early LLM layers) to capture regularities in images without relying on language supervision.

Result: JARVIS shows consistent improvement on vision-centric benchmarks across multiple LLM families while maintaining multimodal reasoning capabilities, according to extensive experiments conducted in the study.

Conclusion: JARVIS successfully enhances the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs without compromising their multimodal reasoning skills, paving the way for better integration of vision and language in AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research introduces 'Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation' and develops the CityNav benchmark to assess the decision-making abilities of MLLMs in realistic city navigation tasks. The study proposes a Verbalization of Path (VoP) approach to improve navigation outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop embodied agents capable of handling complex real-world tasks through robust sequential decision-making, addressing the gaps in existing evaluation benchmarks which do not fully test knowledge-intensive reasoning in practical scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces CityNav, a benchmark focusing on navigation across global cities, requiring agents to rely only on visual inputs and multimodal reasoning without external assistance. It also proposes Verbalization of Path (VoP) to improve internal reasoning through cognitive mapping.

Result: Current state-of-the-art MLLMs and reasoning techniques underperform in realistic navigation tasks. The proposed VoP technique significantly improves navigation accuracy and success by enhancing the agent's internal reasoning process.

Conclusion: This study highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world navigation tasks and demonstrates that grounding internal reasoning through methods like VoP can significantly improve their capabilities.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R4, a framework that equips vision-language models with structured, lifelong memory for enhanced 4D spatio-temporal reasoning without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mimic human capability to perceive and reason in 4D by developing multimodal memories for vision-language models, enabling advanced retrieval and reasoning.

Method: R4 builds a 4D knowledge database by anchoring semantic descriptions in metric space and time, and retrieves contextual information using keys decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal aspects.

Result: Experiments show R4 improves retrieval and reasoning performance in embodied question answering and navigation tasks compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: R4 represents a novel paradigm for training-free, retrieval-augmented embodied 4D reasoning, showing promise for collaborative reasoning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

*Tejas Anvekar,Fenil Bardoliya,Pavan K. Turaga,Chitta Baral,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces The Perceptual Observatory, a framework to evaluate and characterize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with a focus on perceptual grounding, robustness, and reasoning beyond end-task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs have made advancements in power, understanding of their perceptual abilities—beyond leveraging textual knowledge—is still lacking. Current evaluation methods are limited and don't deeply assess robustness and visual grounding.

Method: The authors propose The Perceptual Observatory, which evaluates MLLMs on tasks like face matching, text-in-vision comprehension, and local-to-global understanding. Ground-truth datasets with pixel-based augmentations and stylized illusions are used for assessment.

Result: The framework provides detailed insights into how MLLMs maintain perceptual grounding and relational structure under controlled perturbations, moving beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: The Perceptual Observatory establishes a principled foundation to understand MLLMs' strengths and weaknesses, guiding the development of more robust and visually grounded models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAMP-VLM, a framework to predict multi-human behaviors in third-person scenarios, achieving a 66.9% improvement in prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robots' ability to understand and predict the behaviors of multiple humans in human-populated environments, especially from a third-person perspective.

Method: The paper proposes CAMP-VLM, a Vision Language Model-based framework that utilizes contextual visual data and spatial scene graphs, fine-tuned with synthetic behavior data from a simulator.

Result: CAMP-VLM performs significantly better than existing methods, improving prediction accuracy by up to 66.9%.

Conclusion: CAMP-VLM proves to be a robust approach for predicting multi-human behaviors, addressing limitations in existing robotic applications and datasets.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot multispectral object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated multispectral data restricts deep learning detectors, and textual class information could be leveraged for improving detection.

Method: They adapt VLM-based detectors (Grounding DINO and YOLO-World) for multispectral inputs and integrate text, visual, and thermal modalities.

Result: VLM-based detectors outperform specialized multispectral models in few-shot scenarios and perform competitively in fully supervised settings on FLIR and M3FD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic priors from large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to multispectral inputs, enabling data-efficient detection.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

*Earl Ranario,Mason J. Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) underperform supervised baselines in agricultural classification tasks, achieving limited accuracy in zero-shot and open-ended settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of vision-language models as general-purpose solutions for agricultural decision support.

Method: 27 agricultural datasets from the AgML collection were benchmarked using diverse VLMs, adopting different prompting methods and comparing results to a supervised baseline.

Result: Supervised baseline YOLO11 significantly outperformed VLMs. Constrained prompting yielded better results for closed-source models, while open-ended methods performed poorly.

Conclusion: Current VLMs are not suitable standalone agricultural tools but can assist when paired with structured prompts, domain-aware evaluations, and label ontologies.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robotic lawn mower employing visual perception and adaptive decision-making to preserve biodiversity by identifying and protecting diverse vegetation patches via selective mowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the ecological issue of biodiversity loss in urban areas caused by conventional lawn maintenance methods, aiming to transform lawns into biodiversity-rich spaces.

Method: A ResNet50 network is used to analyze image data for biodiversity estimation through deep feature-space analysis, driving a selective mowing algorithm on a robotic mower to preserve ecological diversity.

Result: Validation showed the mower effectively correlates visual diversity metrics with expert biodiversity assessments, demonstrating the system's potential in maintaining ecological richness.

Conclusion: This robotic mowing framework has the potential to transform lawns into biodiversity-boosting spaces and encourage urban ecological sustainability.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic learning often suffers from insufficient action annotations, limiting the effective use of video data.

Method: The approach involves extending a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel action diffusion model, introducing a Bridge Attention mechanism for cross-modal interaction, and implementing an action refinement module for precise controls.

Result: The method produces higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly surpasses existing methods in evaluations on public datasets.

Conclusion: This scalable framework leverages large-scale video data to advance robotic policy learning, overcoming annotation limitations and improving performance.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the scarcity of real-world safety-critical corner cases needed to evaluate and improve the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

Method: The proposed platform combines a real-world image generator based on flow matching and an adversarial traffic policy to create realistic corner cases during evaluation.

Result: The platform efficiently generates realistic driving scenarios, exposing performance issues in end-to-end autonomous driving models like UniAD and VAD.

Conclusion: The platform effectively detects potential weaknesses in autonomous driving models, contributing to their safety and robustness.

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

*Hao Tang,Hanyu Liu,Alessandro Perelli,Xi Chen,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel diffusion model to predict high angular resolution fiber orientation distributions (HAR-FOD) from low angular resolution data, overcoming current accuracy and time limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is crucial for white matter analysis, but existing methods struggle with either low accuracy or require extensive scanning time.

Method: The authors propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model with novel modules like FOD-patch adapter, voxel-level conditional coordinating module, and SH attention module for efficient and accurate HAR-FOD prediction.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods in predicting HAR-FOD.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly advances HAR-FOD prediction efficiency and accuracy, making it promising for diffusion MRI applications.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

*Haomeng Zhang,Kuan-Chuan Peng,Suhas Lohit,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), which automatically generates class names for detected 3D objects without user input, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods rely on user-specified class names during both training and inference, limiting their practicality. The paper aims to eliminate user input dependency by automating class generation.

Method: The paper introduces the AV3DOD framework that uses a new metric, Semantic Score (SS), to evaluate class name quality. It leverages 2D vision-language models for image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and expanding feature space semantics.

Result: AV3DOD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method (CoDA) by improving localization (3.48 overall mAP) and semantic quality (24.5% relative improvement in SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: AV3DOD demonstrates that auto-generating class names for 3D object detection is feasible and significantly improves performance, pushing the boundaries of open-vocabulary detection research.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets.

Result: LAPX achieves competitive performance on MPII and COCO benchmarks with just 2.3M parameters, while ensuring real-time efficiency for edge devices.

Conclusion: LAPX offers a practical solution for pose estimation on edge devices, striking a balance between high accuracy and low computational overhead.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

*Shunkun Liang,Banglei Guan,Zhenbao Yu,Dongcai Tan,Pengju Sun,Zibin Liu,Qifeng Yu,Yang Shang*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new camera calibration method using a collimator system, introducing constraints that simplify motion requirements and offer novel calibration solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera calibration is essential for photogrammetry and 3D vision, and there is a need for more reliable and flexible calibration methods.

Method: The authors developed a collimator system with an angle invariance constraint, reducing calibration motion to 3DOF spherical motion. They proposed both a linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images, as well as a single image calibration algorithm requiring no camera motion.

Result: The proposed methods were tested in synthetic and real-world scenarios, showing superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The introduced collimator system and methods provide a reliable, fast, and flexible solution for camera calibration, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CattleAct automates grazing cattle interaction detection using a data-efficient approach, combining individual actions into a unified latent space with video and GPS inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting cattle behavior interactions helps optimize livestock management, particularly for estrus detection. Current human-focused systems are inadequate for grazing cattle due to data scarcity.

Method: The method builds a latent space for cattle actions using a large action dataset. It fine-tunes this with rare interactions and contrastive learning for an integrated model.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline systems in interaction detection when tested on commercial-scale pastures.

Conclusion: CattleAct offers an effective, practical system for identifying cattle behavioral interactions, utilizing advanced data-efficient techniques to overcome challenges in rural settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT combining iterative methods and deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reconstruction methods for dual-spectral CT face challenges such as artifacts and channel imbalances, which limit accuracy and reliability.

Method: The framework consists of two phases: a knowledge-driven module using oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) for intermediate solutions, and a data-driven module utilizing ResDynUNet++ for refined outputs.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and superior performance compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Integrating OPMT and ResDynUNet++ successfully improves dual-spectral CT reconstructions by addressing specific challenges like artifacts and imbalances.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SegGraph, a method for few-shot 3D part segmentation using SAM's 2D segmentation masks to enhance geometric feature learning efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of aggregating 2D knowledge into 3D segmentation and overcoming under-segmentation with inconsistent part labels.

Method: A segment graph-based propagation method that models segments' overlap/adjacency relationships using graph neural networks, preserving semantic consistency through view-direction-weighted fusion.

Result: SegGraph outperformed all baselines on the PartNet-E dataset with a significant improvement of at least 6.9% mIoU, excelling particularly in small components and part boundaries segmentation.

Conclusion: The novel SegGraph framework successfully enhances geometric understanding in few-shot 3D part segmentation, demonstrating its practical and high-performing capabilities.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

*Chao Li,Dasha Hu,Chengyang Li,Yuming Jiang,Yuncheng Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses domain discrepancies in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) tasks by proposing C-DGPA, which aligns both marginal and conditional distributions. It outperforms existing approaches on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuning approaches for UDA tasks fail to adequately address conditional distribution discrepancies, resulting in issues such as class prototype misalignment and reduced semantic discriminability.

Method: The proposed method, C-DGPA (Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation), employs a dual-branch strategy: one branch uses dynamic adversarial training to align marginal distributions, while the other employs a Class Mapping Mechanism to address conditional distribution discrepancies and standardize semantic prompt understanding.

Result: C-DGPA achieves superior performance, setting new state-of-the-art results across three benchmarks: OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017.

Conclusion: C-DGPA demonstrates effective dual alignment for marginal and conditional distribution discrepancies, ensuring domain-invariant and semantically discriminative representations in UDA tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras underperform in end-to-end driving when a domain gap exists, particularly in lighting conditions like day and night, necessitating alternative sensors.

Method: The authors propose event cameras instead of traditional ones for handling the day-night domain gap in autonomous driving, comparing their cross-domain and baseline performance.

Result: Event cameras demonstrate stable performance across lighting variations, with domain-shift penalties lower or comparable to grayscale frames and superior baseline in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: Event cameras are a promising alternative to traditional cameras, especially in handling domain gaps due to lighting condition differences.

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Motivation: Existing human motion datasets lack flexibility, customization, and domain-specific applicability, especially for complex scenarios like sports.

Method: Avatar4D generates synthetic human motion data with fine control over pose, appearance, viewpoint, and context. Syn2Sport, a sports-focused dataset, validates its effectiveness.

Result: Synthetic data from Avatar4D improves pose estimation, performs well in zero-shot transfer, aligns closely to real-world datasets, and supports domain-specific sports understanding.

Conclusion: Avatar4D offers a scalable and domain-transferable approach to generate synthetic human motion data, reducing reliance on annotated real-world datasets.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data.

TL;DR: This paper proposes VALOR, a method to improve radiology report generation by addressing cross-modal misalignment. It uses reinforcement learning techniques and shows notable advancements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the accuracy and visual grounding of radiology report generation, given the challenge of cross-modal misalignment and reliance on labeled data or costly methods in existing approaches.

Method: The method, VALOR, applies a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. It uses Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO) to refine text generation and visually align medical vision-language models to better reference relevant image regions.

Result: Experimental results across benchmarks indicate that VALOR improves factual accuracy and visually grounded report generation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VALOR effectively addresses key challenges in radiology report generation by improving both textual preciseness and visual alignment, contributing to more accurate and grounded medical assessments.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

Motivation: AI systems lack effective methods for dynamic, goal-specific categorization of visual scenes, which limits adaptability in changing contexts.

Method: The authors propose OAK, a model integrating learnable context tokens with frozen CLIP, optimizing image-text alignment and visual clustering objectives to discover and expand ad-hoc categories.

Result: OAK achieves 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, outperforming both CLIP and GCD by over 50%, and generates interpretable saliency maps tied to different categorization tasks.

Conclusion: OAK promotes adaptive, transparent, and generalizable categorization, addressing the challenges of open ad-hoc categorization effectively.

Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in comparing 3D point clouds due to their unstructured nature, complex geometries, and limitations of traditional metrics like Hausdorff, Chamfer distances, and existing KL divergence approximations.

Method: The authors represent point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold and introduce the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically bounded stability.

Result: The proposed MSKL divergence provides stable, bounded, and monotonically varying comparisons, validated through experiments for human pose discrimination and animal shape comparison, outperforming traditional metrics.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a stable and theoretically robust framework for analyzing 3D point clouds using GMMs and the MSKL divergence, advancing the precision and reliability of geometric variation measurements.

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in NVS diffusion models, where inconsistent quality in initial random noise affects the final image generation quality, by proposing a method to learn high-quality noise.

Method: A discretized Euler inversion method is designed to inject semantic information into random noise, paired with an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that transforms random noise into high-quality noise.

Result: The Encoder-Decoder Network (EDN) can be integrated into NVS models like SV3D and MV-Adapter, leading to notable improvements in performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances the quality of novel view synthesis from a single input image by optimizing the initial noise patterns, making existing NVS models more robust.

Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SNOW, a framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency for 4D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of VLMs (semantic understanding) and geometric perception (spatial and temporal understanding) for robust robotic navigation and interaction in dynamic environments.

Method: SNOW uses RGB images and 3D point clouds, applying HDBSCAN clustering and SAM2 segmentation guided by Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP) to create 4D Scene Graphs. A lightweight SLAM backend provides spatial anchoring.

Result: SNOW achieved state-of-the-art performance in several benchmarks, enabling precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference.

Conclusion: Structured 4D priors are critical for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics, and SNOW provides a unified model that outperforms existing methods in dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Singular Value Decomposition for image compression, finding it visually effective but inferior in compression efficiency compared to standard codecs like JPEG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising volume of images on the internet demands efficient compression methods to reduce storage and bandwidth usage.

Method: Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations are used for compressing grayscale and multichannel images, assessed by relative Frobenius error and compression ratio.

Result: While low-rank approximations maintain visual similarity to the original images, they are less efficient than codecs like JPEG, with high error levels sometimes resulting in larger compressed file sizes than the original.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Singular Value Decomposition is not a practical alternative to industry-standard formats for efficient image compression.

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

*Jingjing Qian,Boyao Han,Chen Shi,Lei Xiao,Long Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPredict is a vision-language-action framework enhancing robotic manipulation with predictive geometric and kinematic priors, improving performance in 3D reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current reactive, 2D-centric Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in performing precise 3D reasoning for robotic manipulation.

Method: The framework introduces predictive modules for encoding motion history, forecasting 3D keypoint trajectories, and predicting workspace geometries, utilized during training through depth-based rendering but not requiring 3D decoding during inference.

Result: GeoPredict surpasses strong VLA baselines across RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world tasks, particularly excelling in geometry-intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: It offers a significant advancement for robotics, enhancing reliability and spatial precision in 3D-demanding manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

*Zichen Geng,Zeeshan Hayder,Wei Liu,Hesheng Wang,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ARMFlow, an autoregressive framework for real-time 3D human reaction generation, addressing motion fidelity, real-time performance, and error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve high motion fidelity, real-time inference, and adaptability in autoregressive online scenarios.

Method: ARMFlow uses a MeanFlow-based framework with a causal context encoder and velocity predictor, incorporating Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) to minimize error accumulation in autoregressive processes.

Result: ARMFlow achieves high accuracy, low latency, and a 40% improvement in FID over other online methods on datasets like InterHuman and InterX. Its offline variant, ReMFlow, also achieves state-of-the-art performance with fast inference.

Conclusion: ARMFlow effectively addresses online generation challenges, offering superior efficiency and adaptability while maintaining high accuracy and semantic alignment compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

TL;DR: OpenTouch introduces a unique egocentric tactile dataset aligning video, touch signals, and hand pose for multimodal perception, embodied learning, and robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of datasets that align egocentric video, tactile data, and hand pose, hindering research in understanding physical interaction through vision and touch.

Method: The authors present OpenTouch, a synchronized dataset of video, tactile signals, and pose data, along with benchmarks probing the role of touch in perception and action.

Result: OpenTouch demonstrates that tactile data enhances grasp understanding, cross-modal alignment, and supports retrieval from video queries in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: By releasing OpenTouch and its benchmarks, the paper highlights its potential to advance research in multimodal egocentric perception and robotics.

Abstract: The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.

*Qi Zhang,Yunfei Gong,Zhidan Xie,Zhizi Wang,Antoni B. Chan,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-view crowd counting challenges and introduces semi-supervised methods leveraging ranking constraints on model predictions and uncertainties to improve performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of data scarcity in multi-view crowd counting, especially for large and occluded scenes, and reduce dependence on labeled multi-view data.

Method: Two semi-supervised frameworks are proposed: one ranks model predictions based on increasing camera views, and the other ranks their uncertainties guided by prediction errors, incorporating these constraints into training.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed ranking methods outperform other semi-supervised approaches in multi-view crowd counting under data limitations.

Conclusion: The ranking-based semi-supervised methods effectively enhance multi-view crowd counting models, mitigating limitations posed by scarce labeled data.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

*Yuanchen Ju,Yongyuan Liang,Yen-Jen Wang,Nandiraju Gireesh,Yuanliang Ju,Seungjae Lee,Qiao Gu,Elvis Hsieh,Furong Huang,Koushil Sreenath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MomaGraph, a scene representation integrating spatial-functional relationships for mobile manipulators, supported by a dataset (MomaGraph-Scenes) and evaluation suite (MomaGraph-Bench). It also presents MomaGraph-R1, a model achieving state-of-the-art performance in task planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulators need a scene representation that combines object locations, functions, and interactive parts, areas overlooked by prior static or limited models.

Method: MomaGraph is developed as a unified representation supported by MomaGraph-Scenes, a dataset with annotated task-driven scene graphs, and MomaGraph-Bench, an evaluation suite. Additionally, MomaGraph-R1, a vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning, predicts task-oriented scene graphs and plans tasks in a Graph-then-Plan framework.

Result: MomaGraph-R1 outperforms open-source models with 71.6% accuracy, +11.4% over the best baseline, and shows strong generalization on public benchmarks and real-robot tests.

Conclusion: The integration of spatial-functional relationships and task-driven data in MomaGraph substantially enhances task planning and scene understanding for embodied agents.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning model to enhance fluorescence lifetime imaging by reconstructing high-resolution images from lower-resolution data, enabling faster, high-quality imaging for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome clinical adoption barriers of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), such as slow image acquisition and poor signal-to-noise ratio, which limit its resolution and speed.

Method: FLIM_PSR_k is a deep learning-based pixel super-resolution framework utilizing conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) for high-resolution image reconstruction with shorter inference times than diffusion models.

Result: The model delivers a 25-fold improvement in the space-bandwidth product, achieving high-resolution images with finer structural details and statistically significant image quality improvements, validated on tumor tissue samples.

Conclusion: FLIM_PSR_k enhances FLIM's resolution, speed, and compatibility with various hardware platforms, advancing its viability for real-time, label-free diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

*Rui Gui,Yang Wan,Haochen Han,Dongxing Mao,Fangming Liu,Min Li,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextEditBench, a benchmark focused on evaluating text editing capabilities in images, emphasizing semantic coherence and reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text editing in images has been underexplored despite growing interest in text rendering for visual generation. Current models lack robust evaluation tools for semantic consistency and reasoning during text-focused editing.

Method: The authors propose TextEditBench as a benchmark framework to assess text-centric image editing performance, introducing a novel evaluation metric, Semantic Expectation (SE), to measure semantic consistency and multimodal understanding.

Result: Experiments show that existing models struggle with context-aware reasoning and geometric alignment, revealing significant gaps in capabilities in text-centric editing.

Conclusion: TextEditBench creates a vital testing framework for advancing text editing and reasoning performance in multimodal image generation models.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), a model that reconstructs dense 3D scene geometry from unposed multi-view images without relying on explicit 3D priors, outperforming current methods in diverse driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of a dense geometry perception model tailored for autonomous driving that adapts to varied scenarios and camera configurations.

Method: Introducing DVGT, which uses intra-view, cross-view, and cross-frame attentions to infer geometric relations. It reconstructs a dense 3D point map in ego coordinates from multi-view visual inputs without requiring explicit 3D priors or camera parameters.

Result: DVGT was trained on multiple driving datasets and demonstrated better performance compared to existing models across diverse driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DVGT presents a robust solution for 3D scene geometry reconstruction for autonomous driving, being flexible with camera setups and not reliant on external sensors or priors.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios.

*Mohamed Abouagour,Eleftherios Garyfallidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework for automated floor plan generation, tackling challenges in topological planning and geometric realization with a novel two-stage approach. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of automated floor plan design by integrating topological reasoning, functional constraints, and geometric satisfaction into a unified computational framework, areas where prior deep learning approaches fell short.

Method: The method involves GFLAN's two-stage process: (1) sequential allocation of room centroids using a convolutional architecture with dual encoders, and (2) using a Graph Neural Network augmented with Transformers to define room boundaries.

Result: GFLAN enables precise floor plan generation by combining topological and geometric factors, overcoming limitations in previous pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing models.

Conclusion: This novel approach enhances architectural reasoning in automated floor plan generation, advancing computational methods to better satisfy design requirements.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like semantic overlap among categories, label imbalance, and inter-class co-occurrence make multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval difficult.

Method: MACL employs label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling as extensions of contrastive learning for balanced representation learning.

Result: Experiments on DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD datasets show that MACL outperforms existing methods and mitigates semantic imbalance effectively.

Conclusion: MACL addresses critical bottlenecks in multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval and achieves improved retrieval performance over baselines.

Abstract: Semantic overlap among land-cover categories, highly imbalanced label distributions, and complex inter-class co-occurrence patterns constitute significant challenges for multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval. In this article, Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning (MACL) is introduced as an extension of contrastive learning to address them. It integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling to achieve balanced representation learning across both common and rare categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD), show that MACL consistently outperforms contrastive-loss based baselines, effectively mitigating semantic imbalance and delivering more reliable retrieval performance in large-scale remote-sensing archives.

Motivation: Many benchmarks for image generation prioritize aesthetics over detailed performance evaluation. The paper aims to address this gap through pixel-precise analysis.

Method: PixelArena employs semantic segmentation tasks as benchmarks to assess generative intelligence of image-output models with specific focus on visual intelligence and fine-grained generation.

Result: Gemini 3 Pro Image model demonstrates emergent semantic mask generation capabilities under zero-shot settings, performing with high fidelity and true generalization.

Conclusion: Study indicates significant advancements in multi-modal language models, offering insights toward future research in multimodal reasoning, interpretability, and image generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models that have image output are emerging. Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of fine-grained generation capabilities. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. We find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LaverNet, a lightweight network for all-in-one video restoration with only 362K parameters, achieving competitive performance despite its small size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current all-in-one video restoration methods struggle with time-varying degradations, as they often cause models to focus on artifacts rather than content. Moreover, most existing approaches rely on large models, neglecting their inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose LaverNet, a compact video restoration model with a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits degradation-agnostic features across frames, ensuring focus on relevant video content.

Result: LaverNet achieves comparable or even superior performance in all-in-one video restoration benchmarks while maintaining a tiny model size of only 362K parameters.

Conclusion: LaverNet demonstrates that efficient and effective all-in-one video restoration is achievable with a lightweight model, providing a solution to the challenges of time-varying degradations.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

Result: QUIDS improved ASQ by 38% compared to non-dispatching scenarios and reduced map errors significantly by 39-74%.

Conclusion: QUIDS provides an effective quality-focused incentive mechanism for low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring, essential for smart-city applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

### [136] [Collaborative Edge-to-Server Inference for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16349)
*Soochang Song,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel edge-to-server framework for vision-language models (VLMs), which reduces communication cost and maintains accuracy by selectively transmitting high-resolution regions of interest (RoIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of accuracy degradation caused by resizing images for VLM inference, and to minimize communication cost between edge devices and servers.

Method: A two-stage framework where the server initially identifies a region of interest (RoI) using internal attention and computes a confidence measure (min-entropy). If the confidence is low, the edge device transmits a high-resolution RoI for refined inference.

Result: The framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy across various VLM architectures in experiments.

Conclusion: Selective retransmission of visual data preserves inference accuracy and minimizes communication, showing effectiveness and practicality for VLM deployments.

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

*Tao Hu,Weiyu Zhou,Yanjie Tu,Peng Wu,Wei Dong,Qingsen Yan,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GMODiff, a method to address low-level vision challenges in HDR reconstruction by using a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework. It achieves high-quality results while being much faster than traditional LDM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in applying pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to high dynamic range (HDR) reconstruction, including limited dynamic range representation, high computational cost, and content hallucination issues.

Method: The paper proposes GMODiff, which reformulates HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task. It initializes denoising from an informed estimate instead of noise, combining regression-based models (for content fidelity) and LDMs (for perceptual quality).

Result: GMODiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HDR reconstruction and achieves a 100 times faster inference speed compared to other LDM-based approaches.

Conclusion: GMODiff is an effective and efficient solution for HDR reconstruction, offering a balance of content fidelity and perceptual quality, along with significantly improved speed compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

*Haotian Ling,Zequn Chen,Qiuying Chen,Donglin Di,Yongjia Ma,Hao Li,Chen Wei,Zhulin Tao,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'EverybodyDance,' a system for ensuring identity correspondence (IC) correctness in multi-character animation by leveraging an Identity Matching Graph (IMG) and various novel strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While single-character animation has seen significant progress, challenges persist in multi-character scenarios, especially ensuring identity consistency during position swaps.

Method: The method revolves around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), using Mask-Query Attention (MQA) to compute affinities, while optimizing IC correctness. It incorporates strategies like identity-embedded guidance, multi-scale matching, and pre-classified sampling.

Result: The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in maintaining identity correspondence and improving visual fidelity in multi-character animations.

Conclusion: EverybodyDance provides a robust solution for ensuring IC correctness in multi-character settings by combining graph-based formalization and targeted strategies, offering significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

*Mariam Hassan,Bastien Van Delft,Wuyang Li,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a framework that improves Text-to-Video (T2V) models by breaking down video generation into three distinct tasks to address complex scene composition and temporal motion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V diffusion models struggle with composing complex scenes and logical temporal instructions, often due to issues in generating semantically consistent initial frames.

Method: The proposed method, FVG, involves three stages: (1) Reasoning with a Large Language Model to simplify video prompts, (2) Composition using a Text-to-Image model to create an anchor frame, and (3) Temporal Synthesis where a video model animates the scene.

Result: FVG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the T2V CompBench benchmark, improves models on VBench2, and reduces sampling steps by 70% without performance loss, speeding up video generation.

Conclusion: Factorized Video Generation demonstrates a practical and efficient approach to robust and controllable video synthesis, addressing previous limitations in T2V models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the scarcity of annotated medical image segmentation data, which is critical yet labor-intensive to produce.

Method: The proposed AFDAN model leverages cross-domain knowledge transfer through frequency domain alignment and integrates adversarial learning with spatial and frequency features.

Result: AFDAN achieves a high Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 90.9% on the VITILIGO2025 dataset and 82.6% on the DRIVE dataset for segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: AFDAN effectively tackles data scarcity issues in medical segmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, proving its potential for broader application.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*Haodi He,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique using 3D neural representations and Gaussian Splatting to create consistent face models from uncalibrated images. The method reconstructs accurate geometry and textures for use in standard graphics pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a methodology enabling the reconstruction of a human face from uncalibrated images with high accuracy and visual fidelity, overcoming the limitations of conventional 3D representations.

Method: The paper employs Gaussian Splatting for 3D reconstruction, aligned with segmentation annotations and underlying triangulated surfaces, to generate detailed geometry and transform splats into neural textures usable in graphics pipelines.

Result: The system achieves reconstruction from minimal images, disentangles texture from lighting for high-resolution albedo texture, and allows the reconstructed assets to integrate seamlessly into standard pipelines.

Conclusion: This work enhances 3D face modeling with efficient and flexible techniques, enabling high-quality reconstructions from limited input and seamless integration into graphics workflows.

Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

*Liyuan Deng,Hao Guo,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Huaxi Huang,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrepLLM, a new framework enabling large language models to process and reason over 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) data, achieving state-of-the-art results in 3D object classification and captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle to directly handle complex geometric and topological data present in 3D Brep models, limiting their functionality for tasks involving structured 3D geometry.

Method: BrepLLM employs a two-stage pipeline: (1) Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training, where Breps are represented as graphs and aligned with CLIP text embeddings using contrastive learning, and (2) Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning, involving semantic mapping, LLM fine-tuning, and the introduction of Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) for improved 3D understanding.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BrepLLM outperforms existing methods in both 3D object classification and captioning tasks, showing the effectiveness of its approach.

Conclusion: BrepLLM successfully bridges the gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language, opening new pathways for integrating geometric data with LLMs.

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountZES, a framework for zero-shot object counting that selects exemplars progressively through three stages, achieving superior performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot object counting methods struggle with accurate exemplar selection in complex scenes, as they rely on open-vocabulary detectors or random patch sampling, both of which have limitations.

Method: They propose a novel framework, CountZES, consisting of three stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE), to progressively discover diverse and accurate exemplars.

Result: CountZES performs better than existing ZOC methods and generalizes effectively across various domains including natural, aerial, and medical datasets.

Conclusion: CountZES advances zero-shot object counting by providing a robust and training-free solution that effectively resolves issues in exemplar selection, making it applicable across multiple challenging domains.

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple, training-free method to improve subject consistency and text alignment in text-to-image diffusion models without expensive model fine-tuning or per-subject optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple outputs, especially for visual storytelling, due to computationally costly approaches and text misalignment issues like semantic leakage.

Method: The proposed method refines text embeddings from a geometric perspective to suppress unwanted semantics, addressing semantic entanglement without requiring training or heavy computational resources.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in both subject consistency and text alignment compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: This training-free method offers a practical solution to enhance text-to-image diffusion models' performance, making them more suitable for tasks like visual storytelling while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on generating realistic human motion, particularly gaze-primed sequences involving reaching for objects. The researchers curated a substantial dataset and used a text-conditioned, diffusion-based model to generate motions, achieving high success rates for reaching and priming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to better mimic natural human behavior in motion generation, especially in tasks involving gaze priming and object interaction, which have practical implications in robotics and virtual simulations.

Method: The authors curated a new dataset of 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences from five publicly available datasets. They employed a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, fine-tuned for specific movements such as reaching target objects.

Result: The proposed model achieved notable success rates: 60% for prime success and 89% for reach success when applied to the largest dataset (HD-EPIC).

Conclusion: The study advances motion generation by achieving realistic and task-specific human motions, with potential applications in robotic systems and virtual environments.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

*Senmao Li,Kai Wang,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Jian Yang,Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StageVAR enhances the Visual Autoregressive (VAR) image generation process by introducing a stage-aware acceleration framework, achieving up to 3.4x speedup with minimal quality compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing computational complexity and running time in VAR models at large-scale steps, and the inefficiency of existing acceleration techniques.

Method: StageVAR identifies the significance of generation stages, preserving early steps for semantic consistency while approximating later steps for acceleration, using a plug-and-play strategy without additional training.

Result: StageVAR achieved a speedup of up to 3.4x with only negligible quality trade-offs, outperforming existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Stage-aware design significantly enhances efficiency in VAR models, balancing speed and quality in image generation.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

TL;DR: This paper investigates blind image quality assessment (BIQA) and develops a novel model that mimics human-like perception and reasoning using reinforcement learning and self-consistent reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human perception-reasoning cascades and machine learning models for assessing image quality, aiming for human-like and interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

Method: Human evaluation data are collected to mimic human reasoning processes. Reinforcement learning guides the model towards human-like reasoning through reward signals based on human annotations. Additional rewards are designed to train the model for internal self-consistent reasoning.

Result: The model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art BIQA systems in score prediction (Pearson and Spearman correlations). It also demonstrates improved human-model alignment, measured with ROUGE-1 scores, surpassing baselines in capturing human-like explanations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances blind image quality assessment tasks with human-like reasoning capabilities and interpretable outputs, achieving better alignment with human judgment and advancing the field toward more interpretable AI models.

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

### [148] [Smile on the Face, Sadness in the Eyes: Bridging the Emotion Gap with a Multimodal Dataset of Eye and Facial Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16485)
*Kejun Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Lin Wei,Chang Tang,Yibing Zhan,Zijing Chen,Zhe Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the gap in using facial expressions for emotion recognition, proposing the integration of eye behaviors. It introduces the EMER dataset and an efficient EMERT model to improve multimodal emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expressions, while rich in cues, can often function as social tools and fail to represent genuine emotions. There is a need for improved approaches to bridge this gap in emotion recognition.

Method: The authors created the EMER dataset containing eye behavior (e.g., movements, fixation maps) and facial expression videos. They developed EMERT, a Transformer-based model, utilizing multimodal inputs and adversarial features to enhance recognition accuracy.

Result: Experimental results reveal that EMERT surpasses existing state-of-the-art models, highlighting the significance of including eye behaviors for robust emotion analysis.

Conclusion: Eye behaviors can bridge the gap between facial expressions and genuine emotions, offering a more reliable mechanism for emotion recognition. EMER and EMERT demonstrate this successfully, and resources are shared for public use.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap.

### [149] [YOLO11-4K: An Efficient Architecture for Real-Time Small Object Detection in 4K Panoramic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16493)
*Huma Hafeez,Matthew Garratt,Jo Plested,Sankaran Iyer,Arcot Sowmya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOLO11-4K, a real-time, efficient object detection framework specifically designed for 4K panoramic images, achieving higher accuracy and reduced latency compared to existing detectors like YOLO11.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object detectors like YOLO struggle with the computational and accuracy demands of 4K omnidirectional images with inherent spatial distortions and wide fields of view, necessitating a tailored approach.

Method: The framework leverages a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer for small object detection and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational load without compromising efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the CVIP360 dataset was manually annotated for evaluation.

Result: YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3ms inference time per frame, reducing latency by 75% compared to YOLO11 while improving accuracy.

Conclusion: YOLO11-4K successfully addresses the challenges of 4K panoramic object detection, balancing efficiency and precision, making it suitable for real-world usage in areas like surveillance, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality.

Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

### [150] [PoseMoE: Mixture-of-Experts Network for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16494)
*Mengyuan Liu,Jiajie Liu,Jinyan Zhang,Wenhao Li,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (PoseMoE) network to improve monocular 3D pose estimation by disentangling 2D pose and depth features and aggregating information efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance monocular 3D human pose estimation by addressing depth estimation challenges in lifting-based methods and disentangling depth and 2D pose features.

Method: The proposed PoseMoE network uses specialized expert modules to disentangle 2D pose and depth feature encoding and introduces a cross-expert knowledge aggregation module for spatio-temporal enhancement.

Result: PoseMoE achieves superior performance over traditional lifting-based methods on datasets such as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: Disentangling 2D pose and depth features and refining depth before joint encoding significantly improves monocular 3D pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VenusBench-GD, a bilingual, cross-platform GUI grounding benchmark that features extensive data, high annotation quality, and a hierarchical evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding benchmarks are limited in scope, either offering insufficient data or focusing narrowly on specific platforms, limiting their utility for real-world applications.

Method: The authors created VenusBench-GD, a benchmark including diverse UI elements and tasks. They provided a high-quality data pipeline and proposed a hierarchical task taxonomy with six subtasks in basic and advanced categories.

Result: Experimental results show that general multimodal models match or surpass specialized GUI models in basic tasks, but specialized models perform better in advanced tasks while showing overfitting and poor robustness.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the importance of multi-tiered evaluation frameworks and provides critical insights for improving GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: GUI grounding is a critical component in building capable GUI agents. However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

### [152] [Skeleton-Snippet Contrastive Learning with Multiscale Feature Fusion for Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16504)
*Qiushuo Cheng,Jingjing Liu,Catherine Morgan,Alan Whone,Majid Mirmehdi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel self-supervised pretraining paradigm tailored for skeleton-based temporal action localization, employing snippet discrimination and feature fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting action boundaries for skeleton-based temporal action localization requires temporally sensitive features that standard skeleton-based action recognition struggles to provide.

Method: The authors propose snippet discrimination as a self-supervised pretext task, which segments skeleton sequences into non-overlapping parts and utilizes contrastive learning to differentiate them. A U-shaped module is also employed to fuse intermediate features for enhanced resolution.

Result: The approach outperforms existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods on the BABEL dataset and demonstrates state-of-the-art transfer learning results on PKUMMD, pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses challenges in skeleton-based temporal action localization, setting a new benchmark for self-supervised methods in this domain.

Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high cost and time consumption of obtaining pixel-level annotations for pneumonia detection in X-ray images.

Method: A weakly supervised framework using Grad-CAM with image-level labels is proposed. It evaluates seven pre-trained deep learning models under consistent conditions for pneumonia classification and localization.

Result: The models achieve high classification accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best performance and MobileNet-V3 being the lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM visualizations highlight clinically relevant lung areas.

Conclusion: The work underscores the promise of weakly supervised, explainable AI models in radiological diagnostics, improving transparency and clinical trust in pneumonia screening.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia-affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.

*Hossein Javidnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGINet, a method for accurately segmenting intrinsic properties of face images for applications like relighting and high-fidelity facial renderings, offering state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and quality of intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting conditions for realistic rendering, relighting, and material editing.

Method: Using MAGINet, a multi-scale attention-guided network with hierarchical residual encoding, adaptive multi-scale feature fusion, and attention mechanisms, along with a lightweight refinement network and Pix2PixHD-based translation model.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in albedo estimation and intrinsic decomposition quality, proven through experiments on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset.

Conclusion: MAGINet establishes state-of-the-art results for diffuse albedo estimation and advancements in creating a complete rendering stack, allowing for high-quality facial editing and relighting.

Abstract: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

### [155] [TTP: Test-Time Padding for Adversarial Detection and Robust Adaptation on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16523)
*Zhiwei Li,Yitian Pang,Weining Wang,Zhenan Sun,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense mechanism for Vision-Language Models to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models like CLIP are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing risks in applications. Existing defenses either require costly retraining or fail to optimize both robustness and clean data accuracy.

Method: TTP identifies adversarial inputs using cosine similarity shifts in feature embeddings before and after spatial padding. It employs adaptive padding and a similarity-aware ensemble for robust predictions while optionally enhancing clean input accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TTP improves adversarial robustness across diverse model architectures and datasets, surpassing prior test-time defenses while maintaining clean model accuracy.

Conclusion: TTP provides an effective, lightweight solution for enhancing adversarial robustness for Vision-Language Models without compromising on clean data accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

*Yuxin Wang,Lei Ke,Boqiang Zhang,Tianyuan Qu,Hanxun Yu,Zhenpeng Huang,Meng Yu,Dan Xu,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces N3D-VLM, a framework integrating native 3D object perception with 3D-aware reasoning for enhanced spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lack proper 3D object perception, limiting their spatial and depth reasoning capabilities.

Method: The approach involves adding native 3D perception capabilities to models, supported by a scalable data pipeline lifting 2D annotations to 3D, facilitating 3D object grounding and reasoning.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D object grounding and surpasses current methods in 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: With its novel integration of 3D perception and reasoning, N3D-VLM enhances the interpretability and effectiveness of multimodal models in 3D spatial tasks.

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system reconstructing 4D scenes (3D geometry through time) from casual monocular RGB videos, leveraging rigid 3D primitives and motion extrapolation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing scene reconstruction systems which fail to reconstruct persistently and dynamically across time using monocular RGB inputs.

Method: The system uses rigid 3D primitives, dense 2D correspondence estimation, and an optimization pipeline to infer rigid motion and achieve dynamic 4D reconstruction, including invisible object motion extrapolation.

Result: The system enables robust 4D spatio-temporal scene reconstructions, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper provides advancements in replayable dynamic 3D reconstructions, showcasing capabilities like multi-object tracking, object permanence, and articulated object replays.

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yin Zhang,Yongqiang Zhang,Yaoyue Zheng,Bogdan Raducanu,Dan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Causal-Tune,' a fine-tuning strategy to improve Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) by identifying and separating causal and non-causal factors in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in DGSS overlook artifacts in pre-trained VFMs that hinder domain generalization, particularly under adverse conditions.

Method: The authors introduce Causal-Tune, which uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to isolate causal and non-causal factors, refines causal components with learnable tokens, and recombines features after discarding non-causal factors.

Result: Causal-Tune demonstrates superior performance across various cross-domain DGSS tasks, achieving a +4.8% improvement in mIoU under snow conditions.

Conclusion: By disentangling causal and non-causal factors in VFMs, the proposed Causal-Tune method provides a robust approach to domain generalization, especially for challenging and unseen environments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

Motivation: To improve disease progression analysis, treatment planning, and developmental assessment by addressing limitations of current single prior and rigid sampling models in forecasting 3D medical data.

Method: Developed CRONOS, which learns a spatio-temporal velocity field for predicting target volumes at arbitrary times, using 3D voxel space and supporting continuous sequence-to-image forecasting.

Result: CRONOS outperforms baseline models across three public datasets (Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI) while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CRONOS provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for multi-context, continuous-time forecasting in 3D medical imaging, advancing reproducible research with planned code and protocol release.

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SkiLa, a framework for multimodal reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) where visual ideas are encoded as latent sketch tokens, improving visual-text thinking without external toolkits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with tasks that involve visual imagination, unlike humans who naturally integrate visual and textual reasoning due to unified cognitive processes. This paper aims to improve MLLMs by enabling them to perform unified visual-text thinking.

Method: The method involves creating a new system, Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), where the model alternates between generating text tokens for reasoning (textual thinking mode) and latent visual embeddings for imagination (visual sketching mode). A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism ensures that the latent visual embeddings are meaningful.

Result: SkiLa demonstrates superior performance in vision-centric tasks and shows strong generalization to diverse multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: SkiLa provides a novel approach to advancing MLLMs by integrating visual and textual reasoning processes in a unified feature space, enhancing the models' capacity for visual imagination and multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer, improving semantic understanding and achieving state-of-the-art results in image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The locality of CNN in diffusion models limits their capability to capture long-range semantic information.

Method: The model replaces CNN blocks with Swin-transformer blocks, incorporates improved text encoders for better text-image alignment, and optimizes inference through an adapted time-step search.

Result: The Yuan-TecSwin model achieves an FID score of 1.37 on the ImageNet benchmark and demonstrates indistinguishable image generation quality as perceived by human tests.

Conclusion: Replacing CNN with Swin-transformer and refining text conditions enhances diffusion-based image synthesis significantly.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

### [163] [Trainable Log-linear Sparse Attention for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16615)
*Yifan Zhou,Zeqi Xiao,Tianyi Wei,Shuai Yang,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for handling extremely long token sequences in image generation, achieving log-linear complexity while accelerating performance and maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of quadratic self-attention costs in Diffusion Transformers, which limits scalability to long token sequences. Existing approaches like Top-K sparse attention remain inefficient in handling large sequences efficiently.

Method: The proposed method, LLSA, uses a hierarchical structure with log-linear complexity for sparse Top-K selection and attention. It incorporates hierarchical KV Enrichment to preserve global context with fewer tokens and includes an efficient GPU implementation.

Result: LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel sequences, retaining generation quality.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design and efficient implementation of LLSA provide a scalable, effective solution to handle long token sequences in Diffusion Transformers, making it a promising advancement in visual generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores indoor multimedia geolocation using standardised electric socket types for aiding in digital forensic investigations under realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a practical approach for indoor multimedia geolocation to aid law enforcement combating human trafficking, child exploitation, and similar crimes.

Method: Using a three-stage deep learning pipeline to detect sockets, classify them into plug types, and map plug types to countries. New datasets were created and tested in real-world settings.

Result: Achieved high performance in model detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classification (accuracy = 0.912), and mapping to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at high confidence levels).

Conclusion: This pipeline contributes effectively to indoor geolocation for digital forensics and is validated on crowd-sourced hotel images, with open-source availability for practical use.

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

### [165] [DeContext as Defense: Safe Image Editing in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16625)
*Linghui Shen,Mingyue Cui,Xingyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'DeContext,' a targeted perturbation method to protect images from unauthorized manipulation in modern diffusion models, effectively preventing misuse while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the need to counter privacy risks associated with in-context diffusion models, which can manipulate images for harmful purposes such as identity impersonation or misinformation.

Method: DeContext injects small, targeted perturbations into multimodal attention layers of diffusion models, disrupting the propagation of contextual information. It focuses perturbations within key areas like early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks.

Result: DeContext successfully blocks unauthorized image edits while preserving the original image's visual quality during experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit.

Conclusion: DeContext is a robust and efficient defense mechanism against the misuse of in-context diffusion models, emphasizing targeted perturbations in attention pathways as an effective strategy.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

*Danxu Liu,Di Wang,Hebaixu Wang,Haoyang Chen,Wentao Jiang,Yilin Cheng,Haonan Guo,Wei Cui,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in SAR imagery recognition through SARMAE, a self-supervised learning approach enhanced by a large-scale SAR dataset (SAR-1M), speckle-aware techniques, and semantic-anchor constraints, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the data scarcity and speckle noise issues in SAR imagery to improve semantic representation and downstream remote sensing applications.

Method: The authors propose SARMAE, which includes constructing the SAR-1M dataset, introducing Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), and Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC) for robust and consistent SAR feature learning.

Result: SARMAE demonstrates superior performance in classification, detection, and segmentation across various SAR datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SARMAE offers a significant advancement in SAR representation learning, addressing data and noise challenges effectively, and setting a new benchmark for SAR-based tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/SARMAE.

*Giorgos Petsangourakis,Christos Sgouropoulos,Bill Psomas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Giorgos Sfikas,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REGLUE combines image latents, local patch-level semantics, and global image-level tokens within a diffusion framework for superior image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models rely on indirect semantic supervision, slowing down the emergence of high-level semantics and limiting sample quality.

Method: REGLUE employs a unified framework with VAE latents, VFM semantic features, a semantic compressor, and an external alignment loss for better integration of spatial semantics.

Result: REGLUE improves performance metrics like FID and convergence speed compared to baselines and alternative approaches, demonstrating the importance of spatial VFM semantics and non-linear compression.

Conclusion: Unified modeling of global-local-latent semantics and lightweight enhancements unlock the full potential of VFMs in image generation, as illustrated by REGLUE's advancements.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

### [168] [FrameDiffuser: G-Buffer-Conditioned Diffusion for Neural Forward Frame Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16670)
*Ole Beisswenger,Jan-Niklas Dihlmann,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FrameDiffuser, a neural rendering framework for interactive applications that ensures temporal consistency in photorealistic image generation using G-buffer data and previous output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis either lack temporal consistency or are computationally expensive and unsuitable for interactive applications.

Method: FrameDiffuser uses autoregressive neural rendering, combining ControlNet for structural guidance and ControlLoRA for temporal coherence, along with a three-stage training strategy specializing in environment-specific training.

Result: FrameDiffuser generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames over hundreds to thousands of sequences, achieving accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections efficiently.

Conclusion: Specialized environment training in FrameDiffuser provides superior photorealistic quality and temporal stability, making it suitable for interactive applications without the drawbacks of existing models.

Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

*Gonçalo Gaspar Alves,Shekoufeh Gorgi Zadeh,Andreas Husch,Ben Bausch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses data leakage issues in integrating open-source datasets by proposing a subject fingerprinting approach for re-identification using latent space mapping, achieving high accuracy in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to resolve data leakage issues caused by overlapping subjects across multiple open-source datasets, which can lead to misleading model performance results.

Method: The proposed method involves subject fingerprinting, where all images of a subject are mapped to a distinct latent space region for re-identification. A ResNet-50 model using triplet margin loss is employed for this task, and few-shot learning scenarios are evaluated.

Result: The subject fingerprinting method achieves high Mean-Recall-@-K scores across various data types and shot configurations, demonstrating its robustness in re-identifying subjects efficiently.

Conclusion: The study concludes that subject fingerprinting is a promising solution to mitigate data leakage in open-source datasets, improving reliability in model evaluation and re-identification performance.

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

*Serafino Pandolfini,Lorenzo Pellegrini,Matteo Ferrara,Davide Maltoni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of deepfake detectors in identifying localized image manipulations, particularly inpainting, using diverse datasets and techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI allows realistic image edits like inpainting which could be exploited in cybersecurity scenarios. Effective detection tools are needed to address partial image manipulations reliably.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, originally designed for fully synthetic images, applied to localized inpainting detection, using datasets with distinct manipulation types and mask sizes.

Result: Deepfake detectors trained on large datasets show partial transferability to detecting inpainting-based edits, especially for medium and large-area manipulations, outperforming some existing methods.

Conclusion: Deepfake detection models can be extended to detect localized manipulations, providing a basis for enhancing cybersecurity defenses against realistic image edits.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled highly realistic image manipulations, including inpainting and region-level editing. These approaches preserve most of the original visual context and are increasingly exploited in cybersecurity-relevant threat scenarios. While numerous detectors have been proposed for identifying fully synthetic images, their ability to generalize to localized manipulations remains insufficiently characterized. This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.

*Antonella Rech,Nicola Conci,Nicola Garau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SDFoam, a hybrid implicit-explicit model that combines Signed Distance Field (SDF) with Voronoi Diagrams (VD) to improve mesh reconstruction accuracy in 3D rendering methods without sacrificing efficiency or rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural rendering methods like NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve impressive results in view synthesis, but they struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. A solution is needed to create crisper, view-consistent surfaces with optimal topology while maintaining photometric quality and computational efficiency.

Method: The proposed method, SDFoam, jointly learns an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD) and an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). Ray tracing and an Eikonal objective are used for optimization, aligning near-surface Voronoi cells with SDF-defined isosurfaces to enhance surface reconstruction.

Result: SDFoam achieves improved mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance), better surface alignment, and reduced floating artifacts while maintaining similar appearance quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and training speed as RadiantFoam.

Conclusion: SDFoam successfully bridges the gap in mesh reconstruction for neural rendering by integrating SDF and VD, resulting in significant improvement in surface accuracy and topology without compromising efficiency or photometric appearance.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a publicly available, multi-centre, multi-device dataset of annotated fetal ultrasound images for improving AI-assisted fetal growth assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fetal growth assessment is hindered by limitations of manual anatomical landmarking, including time consumption, operator-dependence, variability, and lack of reproducibility. There is a need for annotated multi-source datasets to address these challenges.

Method: A benchmark dataset of 4,513 de-identified ultrasound images from 1,904 subjects across three clinical sites and seven devices was created. It includes anatomical landmark annotations, standardized train/test splits, evaluation tools, and baseline results.

Result: The dataset quantifies domain shifts, revealing performance overestimation when limited to single-centre evaluations. The multi-centre dataset offers a fair and reliable benchmark for AI model evaluation.

Conclusion: This publicly available dataset supports robust domain adaptation, improves multi-centre generalisation, and enables more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessments.

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition, along with HMATr, a framework achieving superior recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of public datasets and task-specific solutions hampers online micro gesture recognition, critical for VR/AR interaction.

Method: A multi-view self-supervised skeleton data generation pipeline and semi-automatic annotation, alongside the Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr) integrating gesture detection and classification.

Result: OMG-Bench dataset developed with 40 gesture classes and 13,948 instances; HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving detection rates by 7.6%.

Conclusion: OMG-Bench and HMATr set a new standard in gesture recognition, providing resources and approaches to address challenges in the field.

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in RS, especially the complexity of semantic mask control and sampling quality, which limits the utility of synthetic data for segmentation tasks.

Method: The study proposes TODSynth, which integrates a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a task-feedback-based sampling strategy. It also introduces CRFM to dynamically adjust sampling using semantic loss.

Result: Experiments show that TODSynth surpasses other methods in generating stable, task-specific synthetic data, particularly for complex and few-shot RS semantic segmentation scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that TODSynth effectively bridges the gap between synthetic data and segmentation tasks, enhancing synthetic data's task-relevance and stability.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: Make-It-Poseable is a novel framework for posing 3D characters by transforming latent spaces, overcoming traditional challenges like inaccurate skinning and poor pose conformance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D character posing methods face issues such as skinning inaccuracies, topological flaws, and suboptimal pose adaptation, affecting robustness and generality.

Method: The proposed feed-forward framework reforms character posing as a latent-space transformation problem, leveraging a latent posing transformer and dense pose representation for direct latent manipulation.

Result: The method achieves superior posing quality while supporting applications in 3D editing tasks like part replacement and refinement.

Conclusion: Make-It-Poseable offers an innovative solution to longstanding limitations in 3D posing by introducing a latent-space-based approach, demonstrating high adaptability and quality in results.

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

*Enis Baty,C. P. Bridges,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDet is a new object detection technique based on Conditional Flow Matching, outperforming previous diffusion-based methods like DiffusionDet in terms of efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve object detection frameworks by addressing the limitations of diffusion-based generative methods. It specifically targets the complexity of stochastic transport paths and seeks efficient performance scaling without retraining.

Method: The proposed FlowDet reformulates object detection as a generative transport problem using simpler linear paths enabled by Conditional Flow Matching, contrasting existing diffusion-based curved transport paths.

Result: FlowDet achieves significant performance improvements over DiffusionDet and non-generative baselines, showcasing better precision/recall under recall-constrained scenarios across datasets like COCO and LVIS.

Conclusion: FlowDet demonstrates the advantages of utilizing simpler generative transport paths for object detection, achieving speed and accuracy gains while maintaining flexibility in varying detection configurations.

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an integrated system that simplifies and enhances video creation and editing by handling multimodal inputs and bridging disjointed processes.

Method: The framework uses a unified multimodal representation, supported by a robust data system, large-scale pre-training, and optimized inference infrastructure.

Result: Kling-Omni excels in video generation, reasoning-based editing, and following multimodal instructions.

Conclusion: Kling-Omni is a milestone toward creating systems that understand, generate, and interact with dynamic and complex environments.

Abstract: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R3ST, a synthetic dataset that integrates realistic vehicle trajectories derived from real-world data to enhance the accuracy of trajectory forecasting for road safety research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic vehicle motion and the challenge of precise annotations in traffic analysis datasets.

Method: Combining synthetic 3D environment with real-world trajectories derived from SinD dataset captured via drone footage.

Result: R3ST provides multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories, closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: R3ST advances trajectory forecasting research by offering accurate and realistic data, facilitating improvements in traffic analysis and road safety.

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

### [180] [KineST: A Kinematics-guided Spatiotemporal State Space Model for Human Motion Tracking from Sparse Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16791)
*Shuting Zhao,Zeyu Xiao,Xinrong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces KineST, a kinematics-guided state space model for enhanced full-body motion tracking using sparse signals from head-mounted AR/VR devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle to accurately and efficiently reconstruct realistic, diverse full-body poses using sparse AR/VR device signals, while balancing computational costs and temporal coherence.

Method: KineST uses a kinematics-guided state space model with bidirectional scanning embedding kinematic priors and a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning strategy. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss improves motion stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show that KineST outperforms existing methods in accuracy and temporal consistency, maintaining a lightweight computational framework.

Conclusion: KineST effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies, integrates local and global pose perception, and balances accuracy and efficiency for AR/VR motion tracking.

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

### [181] [DenseBEV: Transforming BEV Grid Cells into 3D Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16818)
*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DenseBEV method for efficient multi-camera 3D object detection, leveraging Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features as direct object anchors. It achieves state-of-the-art results with significant performance improvements over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve multi-camera 3D object detection by addressing inefficiencies in traditional and auxiliary anchor-based approaches. It seeks to create a more intuitive and effective method leveraging spatial-temporal BEV features.

Method: DenseBEV uses a two-stage anchor generation method rooted in BEV feature cells, along with BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression for efficient query scaling. It integrates temporal modeling, leveraging embedded temporal BEV data and prior detections, to enhance detection performance.

Result: Evaluations on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets show significant improvements, including state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo dataset with a LET-mAP of 60.7%, as well as enhanced pedestrian detection metrics.

Conclusion: The DenseBEV method offers a precise, efficient, and scalable solution for 3D object detection, utilizing BEV features directly for better performance on small objects and complex datasets. It represents a step forward in leveraging spatial-temporal data for detection tasks.

Abstract: In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems. This effort marks a significant stride towards the development of smarter and more efficient urban infrastructures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a compact image-to-text model for generating the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from single frontal images, achieving significant performance gains using anatomical attention integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of resource-intensive radiology report generation systems, which rely on extensive multimodal training and multiple imaging views, making them inaccessible in most clinical settings.

Method: This study proposes a model combining a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer encoder and a GPT-2 decoder with anatomical attention layers directed by lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing.

Result: The model exhibited significant improvements on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, with CheXpert Macro-F1 increasing by 168% and RadGraph F1 improving by 9.7%. It enhanced both spatial grounding and structural coherence in the generated reports.

Conclusion: Decoder-level anatomical guidance using segmentation masks enables the generation of more spatially grounded and coherent radiology findings, even with a small, purely image-conditioned model.

Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

### [184] [GenEval 2: Addressing Benchmark Drift in Text-to-Image Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16853)
*Amita Kamath,Kai-Wei Chang,Ranjay Krishna,Luke Zettlemoyer,Yushi Hu,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of benchmark drift in text-to-image (T2I) evaluation, focusing on the inadequacy of the GenEval benchmark for newer models and proposes GenEval 2 with a new evaluation method for better alignment with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the challenge of developing T2I evaluation benchmarks that remain accurate and relevant over time, especially as newer, more advanced models are developed.

Method: The authors identified the drift in alignment between GenEval and human judgment through a study and designed GenEval 2 with enhanced challenges and compositionality. They also introduced Soft-TIFA, an evaluation based on visual primitives, to reduce future benchmark drift.

Result: Their study revealed significant benchmark drift in GenEval, with up to 17.7% error in aligning with human judgment. GenEval 2 and Soft-TIFA demonstrated higher alignment with human evaluations and better robustness to modern T2I models.

Conclusion: GenEval 2 and Soft-TIFA are proposed as improved benchmarks for evaluating T2I models, with hopes they will remain effective for years. However, they stress that continuous audits and updates are necessary to sustain benchmark relevance.

Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents RePlan, a novel plan-then-execute framework for complex instruction-based image editing, improving precision and fidelity in multi-region edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle in image editing tasks under IV-Complexity due to challenges in detailed language instructions and cluttered visual scenes.

Method: The proposed RePlan framework combines a vision-language planner for instruction decomposition and grounding with a diffusion-based editor using attention-region injection for precise multi-region edits.

Result: RePlan achieves better performance than baseline models across IV-Edit benchmarks, demonstrating enhanced reasoning fidelity, regional precision, and format handling.

Conclusion: RePlan successfully addresses IV-Complexity challenges by leveraging reinforcement learning and novel editing mechanisms, setting a new benchmark for instruction-based visual editing.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel Seal is a state-of-the-art approach for invisible watermarking in images and videos, addressing robustness and imperceptibility challenges effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the challenges of balancing robustness and true imperceptibility in digital watermarking, which existing methods struggle with, particularly in high-resolution content.

Method: The paper proposes an adversarial-only training paradigm, a three-stage training schedule to decouple objectives, and high-resolution adaptation techniques like JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation.

Result: Pixel Seal outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in robustness and imperceptibility, showing superior performance across various image types and transformations, with scalable adaptation to video.

Conclusion: Pixel Seal is a practical and scalable solution for digital watermarking, offering reliable provenance for real-world image and video applications.

Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

*Valay Bundele,Mehran Hosseinzadeh,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMeDI-SAM3 significantly improves surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos by addressing memory limitations and occlusion issues in SAM3, achieving state-of-the-art results without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in surgical instrument segmentation, such as occlusions, rapid motion, and identity recovery, which limit the performance of existing methods, particularly SAM3, in endoscopic videos.

Method: The paper introduces ReMeDI-SAM3, a memory-enhanced, training-free extension of SAM3. It includes relevance-aware memory filtering for occlusion management, piecewise interpolation for expanded memory capacity, and a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for more reliable recovery from occlusions.

Result: ReMeDI-SAM3 achieves significant performance improvements on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 datasets, showing 7% and 16% absolute mcIoU gains over SAM3 in a zero-shot setting, surpassing prior training-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ReMeDI-SAM3 demonstrates that a training-free, memory-enhanced approach can address key limitations in surgical instrument segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) that estimates material properties of complex objects (e.g., flowers) from videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating material properties of real-world objects that are multi-material and have complex geometries, surpassing the limitations of existing simplistic methods.

Method: The proposed method, M-PhyGs, segments objects into similar materials and estimates their physical parameters using video data. It incorporates cascaded 3D and 2D losses, temporal mini-batching, and accounts for gravity.

Result: Through the newly introduced Phlowers dataset, which involves video interactions with flowers, M-PhyGs demonstrates accurate and effective multi-material physical parameter estimation.

Conclusion: M-PhyGs offers a novel way to estimate the material composition and parameters of complex, multi-material objects, validated through experimental results on a challenging dataset.

Abstract: Knowledge of the physical material properties governing the dynamics of a real-world object becomes necessary to accurately anticipate its response to unseen interactions. Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.

### [189] [LinkedOut: Linking World Knowledge Representation Out of Video LLM for Next-Generation Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891)
*Haichao Zhang,Yao Lu,Lichen Wang,Yunzhe Li,Daiwei Chen,Yunpeng Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LinkedOut, a novel representation derived from Video Large Language Models (VLLMs), designed to address limitations in video recommendation by enabling fast inference, multi-video analysis, and retention of fine-grained visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of applying VLLMs to downstream video tasks such as recommendation, which require lightweight, low-latency solutions and preservation of visual details that current approaches fail to address.

Method: The authors propose LinkedOut, a representation that uses VLLMs to extract semantically rich and knowledge-aware tokens from raw videos through promptable queries, augmented by optional auxiliary modalities. They introduce a cross-layer Knowledge Fusion MoE to integrate these tokens at different abstraction levels for personalized, low-latency, and interpretable tasks.

Result: LinkedOut achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for video recommendation and eliminates the need for handcrafted labels. The approach also demonstrates strong interpretability and benefits from diverse layer-wise feature usage.

Conclusion: LinkedOut effectively applies VLLMs for downstream vision tasks like recommendation, offering a practical and interpretable solution that utilizes VLLM's world knowledge and visual reasoning to address existing limitations.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

Motivation: Existing 2D-based portrait animation methods struggle with 3D consistency and speed, while 3D-aware methods sacrifice expressive detail. The authors seek to create a method that merges these strengths for real-world applications.

Method: The method distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models into a feed-forward encoder, creating a fast, 3D-consistent, and expressive animatable representation. It uses a lightweight local fusion strategy for efficient integration of 3D structure and animation.

Result: The proposed method achieves 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while offering comparable animation quality to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming alternative designs in efficiency and quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a lightweight and high-speed approach can preserve 3D consistency and achieve high-quality animation, bridging the gap between 2D diffusion-based methods and 3D-aware feedforward approaches.

Abstract: Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

*Shuyuan Tu,Yueming Pan,Yinming Huang,Xintong Han,Zhen Xing,Qi Dai,Kai Qiu,Chong Luo,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashPortrait is a diffusion-based video transformer creating ID-preserving long animation videos with up to 6x speed acceleration by using innovative processing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ID consistency in long-portrait animations and achieve significant acceleration in the animation inference process.

Method: FlashPortrait extracts ID-agnostic features, aligns them with Normalized Facial Expression Blocks, employs a dynamic sliding-window inference scheme, and leverages higher-order latent derivatives to predict future latents, speeding up denoising.

Result: FlashPortrait demonstrated qualitative and quantitative effectiveness on benchmarks by ensuring ID preservation and achieving up to 6x inference speed.

Conclusion: FlashPortrait provides an efficient solution for generating identity-consistent long-duration animations while significantly speeding up the rendering process.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [192] [Alchemist: Unlocking Efficiency in Text-to-Image Model Training via Meta-Gradient Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16905)
*Kaixin Ding,Yang Zhou,Xi Chen,Miao Yang,Jiarong Ou,Rui Chen,Xin Tao,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Alchemist, a meta-gradient-based framework designed to improve the efficiency and quality of Text-to-Image (T2I) generative model training by selecting optimal data subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models struggle with performance limitations due to low-quality or redundant training data from web-crawled and synthetic datasets, leading to inefficiency and degraded outcomes. Current filtering methods are either manual or heuristic, lacking scalability and depth.

Method: Alchemist uses a meta-gradient-based approach involving two stages: data rating (estimating sample influence via a lightweight rater) and data pruning (selecting subsets using Shift-Gsampling). The framework automatically learns the impact of each data sample to optimize training.

Result: Alchemist significantly enhances the visual quality and performance of T2I models, demonstrating that training on Alchemist-filtered 50% datasets outperforms training on the complete dataset.

Conclusion: Alchemist offers a scalable and automated solution to optimize training datasets for T2I models, surpassing existing methods and proving its practical value in improving model performance with reduced data usage.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VIVA, a framework for instruction-based video editing. It uses VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization to improve editing generalization and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video editing methods struggle to handle diverse and complex real-world instructions due to their reliance on paired data of simple edits.

Method: VIVA uses a VLM-based instructor to encode instructions and introduces Edit-GRPO to directly optimize for instruction-following, content-preserving, and aesthetic edits. A data pipeline is also proposed for creating high-fidelity paired data.

Result: VIVA demonstrates superior performance in instruction adherence, generalization, and editing quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the generalization gap in instruction-based video editing, providing a scalable and high-quality solution.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing aims to modify an input video according to a natural-language instruction while preserving content fidelity and temporal coherence. However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io

Method: The paper introduces a new method called SceneDiff, which combines pretrained 3D models, segmentation, and image encoding to compare spatial and semantic features, alongside the SceneDiff Benchmark to evaluate multiview change detection.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches significantly, with relative AP improvements of 94% and 37.4% on multi-view and two-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SceneDiff method and benchmark advance robust multiview object change detection, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling more accurate detection across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying objects that have been added, removed, or moved between a pair of captures (images or videos) of the same scene at different times. Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed. We introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, comprising 350 diverse video pairs with thousands of changed objects. We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks. Our method aligns the captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic region features to detect changes. Experiments on multi-view and two-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements). The benchmark and code will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SFTok, a discrete tokenizer designed for high-resolution image reconstruction using a multi-step iterative mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete tokenizers, although essential for autoregressive models, struggle with performance compared to continuous tokenizers, limiting their integration within multimodal systems.

Method: Utilizes self-forcing guided visual reconstruction and a debias-and-fitting training strategy to address multi-step reconstruction inconsistencies and improve image quality.

Result: SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction on ImageNet with rFID = 1.21 and remarkable class-to-image generation performance (gFID = 2.29).

Conclusion: SFTok outperforms prior discrete tokenizers, demonstrating its potential for advancing multimodal image generation applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

Conclusion: The proposed model and methodologies significantly improve metric depth prediction in panoramic scenes, providing a generalizable solution suitable for diverse environments.

Abstract: In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniStereo, a unified dataset for stereo video conversion, and StereoPilot, a feed-forward model for direct stereo synthesis without relying on depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for stereo video content from VR headsets and 3D cinemas requires advancements in efficient and high-quality Monocular-to-Stereo conversion methods.

Method: The authors developed a unified large-scale dataset (UniStereo) and proposed a model (StereoPilot) that employs a learnable domain switcher and cycle consistency loss to directly synthesize stereo views without depth mapping.

Result: StereoPilot shows superior performance in visual quality and computational efficiency compared to existing methods, according to extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The paper addresses fundamental challenges in Monocular-to-Stereo conversion, achieving advancements through novel dataset creation and efficient stereo video synthesis methods.

Abstract: The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdaTooler-V, a multimodal large language model designed for adaptive visual tool usage, addressing inefficiencies in existing models for visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal language models suffer from blind tool-use reasoning, unnecessarily invoking vision tools, leading to increased inference overhead and decreased performance.

Method: The authors develop AdaTooler-V, incorporating the AT-GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm with adaptively adjusted rewards, supported by two new datasets for training (AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k and AdaTooler-V-300k).

Result: AdaTooler-V demonstrates strong reasoning abilities across twelve benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, including surpassing commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on specific high-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: AdaTooler-V effectively addresses the issue of blind tool-use in multimodal language models, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency in diverse visual reasoning tasks while promoting open access to research tools.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.

Result: EasyV2V achieves state-of-the-art video editing performance, outperforming existing systems and offering flexible input options such as video+text and video+mask+reference+text.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that lightweight modifications using existing model capabilities and effective data design can lead to significant advancements in video editing with broad applicability and superior results.

Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

TL;DR: AuditDM is an automated framework to audit and refine multimodal language models by identifying and rectifying their weaknesses, leading to performance improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack interpretability and fail to adequately expose capability gaps, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM using reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images, uncovering model weaknesses and providing annotation-free data for retraining.

Result: AuditDM uncovers over 20 types of failure modes in state-of-the-art models and showcases performance improvements across 16 benchmarks, even enabling a smaller 3B model to outperform a 28B counterpart.

Conclusion: Targeted model auditing using AuditDM is a promising strategy for diagnosing and enhancing the performance of multimodal language models, particularly as data scaling becomes less effective.

Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

TL;DR: The paper explores generative pretraining for visual models using Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA), yielding strong results without additional design complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by generative pretraining's success in NLP, the authors aim to investigate if similar principles can be applied for visual self-supervised learning.

Method: NEPA trains models on embedding prediction using causal masking and stop gradient techniques, focusing on predicting future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones.

Result: NEPA achieves strong performance, with 83.8% and 85.3% accuracy on ImageNet-1K using ViT-B and ViT-L backbones, and effective transfer to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Conclusion: Embedding-based generative pretraining offers a scalable, simple, and potentially modality-agnostic solution for visual self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Generative Refocusing method for single-image refocusing, combining DeblurNet for all-in-focus recovery and BokehNet for adjustable bokeh creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field control in photography is challenging, especially for single-image refocusing, due to limitations in current methods like dependency on synthetic data and restricted aperture control.

Method: Generative Refocusing uses a semi-supervised training approach with DeblurNet and BokehNet, blending synthetic paired data and unpaired real bokeh images with EXIF metadata for realistic optical features.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks, along with text-guided refocusing and custom aperture shapes.

Conclusion: Generative Refocusing successfully enhances single-image refocusing by overcoming drawbacks of existing methods, offering realistic and customizable depth-of-field effects.

Abstract: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle with generating coherent and interactive simulated world events as they either rely solely on text or lack the ability to control trajectory and rich semantic intent.

Method: WorldCanvas integrates natural language input, trajectory control, and reference images to generate simulation videos with multi-agent interactions and object consistency.

Result: The method demonstrates video generation with temporal coherence, emergent consistency, and controllability over events including motion, interactions, and visual grounding.

Conclusion: WorldCanvas is a step toward interactive and expressive world modeling, shifting from passive prediction to user-driven world simulations.

Abstract: We present WorldCanvas, a framework for promptable world events that enables rich, user-directed simulation by combining text, trajectories, and reference images. Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.

TL;DR: LOG.io introduces a solution for rollback recovery and data lineage in serverless scalable distributed data pipelines, improving recovery performance under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an efficient rollback recovery mechanism and precise data lineage capture in distributed, scalable serverless architectures, addressing limitations in handling non-deterministic operations and external interaction.

Method: LOG.io uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol and supports a general, flexible programming model. It enables non-blocking recovery allowing operators to recover independently, supports dynamic scaling during execution, and minimizes lineage capture overhead.

Result: Performance tests show LOG.io matches or outperforms ABS during recovery when handling stragglers and moderate event throughput. While ABS performs better under certain conditions, LOG.io benefits from data parallelization. Lineage capture overhead is consistently less than 1.5%.

Conclusion: LOG.io is effective for specific distributed pipeline conditions, offering competitive or superior recovery performance and minimal lineage capture overhead, particularly when leveraging data parallelism.

Abstract: This paper introduces LOG.io, a comprehensive solution designed for correct rollback recovery and fine-grain data lineage capture in distributed data pipelines. It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.

*Lingfeng Tang,Daoping Zhang,Junjie Chen,Peihao Huang,Feng Jin,Chengguang Xu,Yuxin Chen,Feiqiang Sun,Guo Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a solution to overcome PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks for LLM performance by enabling efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the bottleneck created by limited PCIe bandwidth in large language model applications, which affects prefix cache fetching and model switching performance.

Method: The authors propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a system involving dynamic library injection to enable GPU and host memory multipath data transfers without requiring code modifications.

Result: MMA achieves a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s, a 4.62x improvement over traditional single-path PCIe bandwidth, and reduces LLM serving latencies by up to 2.48x in various scenarios.

Conclusion: MMA significantly alleviates bandwidth limitations in LLM operations and provides practical and impactful acceleration in model serving and switching tasks through multipath data transfer.

Abstract: The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.

*Yifei Qiu,Tianle Liao,Xin Jin,Shaohua Wu,Dusit Niyato,Qinyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Goal-Oriented Semantic Twin (GOST), a new framework for 6G space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSIN) that emphasizes task-specific, efficient, semantic-driven management over traditional digital twin design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of SAGSIN systems demands efficient and real-time operational and situational frameworks. Traditional digital twins (DTs) face computational, synchronization, and semantic challenges in this context.

Method: The authors propose the GOST framework, which moves away from high-fidelity DT replication to prioritize utility and goal-oriented semantic technologies. Three layers—knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-driven principles—support its design.

Result: GOST framework demonstrated superior timeliness and efficiency in tasks such as collaborative tracking in remote satellite-UAV networks compared to traditional DTs.

Conclusion: GOST establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for managing and optimizing SAGSIN operations, addressing critical limitations of DTs, and guides future research and development.

Abstract: A space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN) has emerged as a cornerstone of 6G systems, establishing a unified global architecture by integrating multi-domain network resources. Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking. Finally, we outline research directions, establishing GOST as a transformative twinning paradigm to guide the development of SAGSIN.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates cold-start latency issues in serverless computing as a developer-visible design problem and proposes solutions to improve diagnostics and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start latency is a major performance bottleneck in serverless computing, impacting deployment and scaling efficiency.

Method: The authors examined issue reports from open-source serverless systems, created taxonomies for cold-start issues, and introduced tools like SCABENCH for benchmarking and INITSCOPE for code analysis.

Result: INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared to prior tools. Developers also showed improved accuracy and faster diagnosis using these tools.

Conclusion: The findings promote performance-aware practices and offer reusable tools to address cold-start latency challenges effectively in serverless computing environments.

Abstract: Serverless computing simplifies deployment and scaling, yet cold-start latency remains a major performance bottleneck. Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design. Availability: The research artifact is publicly accessible for future studies and improvements.

*Hsu-Tzu Ting,Jerry Chou,Ming-Hung Chen,I-Hsin Chung*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in efficiently using NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) by proposing a scheduling framework to tackle resource contention and fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern GPU workloads require efficient resource sharing, but leveraging MIG introduces challenges such as contention and fragmentation due to its hardware partition limitations.

Method: The paper presents an online scheduling framework combining conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration to adapt job placement and reorganize GPU allocations.

Result: The proposed approach achieves up to a 35% improvement in makespan through enhanced system efficiency and reduced fragmentation and contention.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic methods for GPU resource management improves efficiency and utilization significantly, addressing MIG's inherent limitations.

Abstract: Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses scheduling challenges in complex distributed architectures for Large Language Model serving, proposing mechanisms to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize the scheduling challenges in DP+EP architecture setups of Large Language Models, which suffer from synchronization issues that degrade efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS) to optimize execution batches and eliminate queuing bubbles, alongside a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy for computational load balancing.

Result: Implemented in a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, the system achieved a 30%-40% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and a 15%-20% throughput enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed scheduling mechanisms overcome synchronization inefficiencies in DP+EP architectures, significantly enhancing TTFT and throughput in LLM-serving environments.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) serving towards complex, distributed architectures--specifically the P/D-separated, large-scale DP+EP paradigm--introduces distinct scheduling challenges. Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines.

*Zhisheng Hu,Pengfei Zuo,Junliang Hu,Yizou Chen,Yingjia Wang,Ming-Chang Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Lotus is a scalable distributed transaction system for disaggregated memory environments that eliminates lock bottlenecks by executing locks on compute nodes, improving throughput and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance bottlenecks caused by excessive one-sided atomic operations on memory node's RDMA network interfaces in existing distributed transaction systems for disaggregated memory.

Method: The paper introduces Lotus, which disaggregates locks from data and manages locks on compute nodes using an application-aware approach, a lock-first transaction protocol, and a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism.

Result: Experimental results show that Lotus achieves up to 2.1x improvement in transaction throughput and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to existing distributed transaction systems for disaggregated memory.

Conclusion: By executing locks on compute nodes and employing novel mechanisms, Lotus achieves better scalability and efficiency, solving bottleneck issues in disaggregated memory transaction systems.

Abstract: Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.
  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlexKV introduces index proxying in memory-disaggregated key-value stores to overcome inefficiencies in index processing and compute-side caching, substantially boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving resource utilization in data centers through disaggregated memory architecture, specifically addressing inefficiencies in key-value store operations.

Method: FlexKV dynamically offloads the index to compute nodes and proposes three strategies: rank-aware hotness detection for load balancing, two-level compute node memory optimization, and RPC-aggregated cache management.

Result: Experimental results show throughput improvement by up to 2.94× and latency reductions by up to 85.2% compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: FlexKV effectively addresses performance bottlenecks in memory-disaggregated KV stores and demonstrates significant improvements in throughput and latency over prior approaches.

Abstract: Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable results, their high computational and memory demands hinder deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

Method: The proposed framework uses an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to minimize data transfer, offloads computations to the CPU for efficient handling of cache misses, and leverages CPU multithreading for optimization.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved inference performance and shows the benefits of CPU-GPU collaboration for single-request inference on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: Strategic CPU-GPU collaboration and caching mechanisms can drive efficient deployment of large models on limited-resource devices, reducing latency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the constraints and challenges of evolving MEC systems by developing strategies to optimize server upgrades and task offloading for improving performance under budgetary and practical constraints.

Method: The authors propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for small networks and a scalable heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H) for large networks, focusing on deployment, server upgrades, and task offloading.

Result: The MILP model provides optimal solutions for small networks, while M-ESU/H achieves near-optimal results (1.25% deviation) with significantly higher computational efficiency. M-ESU/H also outperforms alternative solutions in large networks, improving task satisfaction by up to 21.57%.

Conclusion: M-ESU/H demonstrates scalability, computational efficiency, and practical applicability, making it a valuable tool for long-term MEC system planning and optimization under dynamic budget and demand conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, the Multi-stage Edge Server Upgrade (M-ESU) is proposed as a new network planning problem, involving the upgrading of an existing multi-access edge computing (MEC) system through multiple stages (e.g., over several years). More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc convexity checking for model expressions is computationally expensive, making it important to directly generate globally convex models.

Method: Integrates symbolic regression with DCP composition rules to automatically generate expressions that are convex by construction.

Result: Discovered convex surrogates with functional forms more flexible and accurate than standard fixed-parameter models, while ensuring interpretability and safety.

Conclusion: DiscoverDCP provides a novel and robust framework for creating convex models suitable for safety-critical applications in control and optimization.

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer, and strategic model selection for S&P 500 prediction, achieving 60.14% accuracy, notably higher than traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the predictive accuracy in financial market prediction to overcome challenges from noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency.

Method: The method integrates quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and diverse algorithm ensemble (like LSTM, XGBoost) on the same dataset while using strategic filtering to exclude weak predictors.

Result: Achieved 60.14% directional accuracy, improving by 3.10% over single models and demonstrated statistical significance and trading potential with a Sharpe ratio of 1.2.

Conclusion: The approach delivers enhanced predictive accuracy, outperforms previous techniques, and confirms the feasibility of machine learning applications in financial market trading strategies.

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face challenges in high memory usage, but the proposed SHARe-KAN framework provides an efficient solution, achieving major memory reductions without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs face severe memory and performance bottlenecks due to the structure and density of their learned basis functions, making them unsuitable for memory-limited environments unless optimized.

Method: The proposed SHARe-KAN framework employs Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to reduce functional redundancy and utilizes the LUTHAM compiler for memory-efficient execution, maintaining performance in a dense representation.

Result: SHARe-KAN achieves an $88\times$ runtime memory reduction and maintains baseline accuracy. Its execution on hardware optimizes memory use and performance with over 90% L2 cache residency.

Conclusion: The SHARe-KAN framework addresses the memory inefficiency of Vision KANs, enabling deployment in constrained environments while retaining high accuracy and improving computational feasibility.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

TL;DR: AIE4ML is a framework for optimizing AI firmware for AMD's AIE-ML devices, achieving high efficiency and low latency for neural network execution across the 2D fabric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in optimizing AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine due to intricate architecture demands an automated approach.

Method: Introduced AIE4ML to transform AI models into optimized firmware, utilizing structured parallelization, efficient graph placement, and compatibility with high-level tools.

Result: Framework achieved up to 98.6% efficiency in benchmarks, using 97.4% of AIE tiles and enabling entirely on-chip data execution.

Conclusion: AIE4ML offers GPU-class throughput and microsecond latency, making it suitable for ultra-low-latency applications like particle physics trigger systems.

Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation tasks and introduces a frequency signal scaler and space flip method to enhance Spectral GNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear role of low- and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation tasks, and to enhance the capability of GNNs in processing graph signals effectively.

Method: The authors theoretically prove the equivalence of low- and high-frequency signals in smoothing user-item similarities, propose a frequency signal scaler to adjust graph filters, and introduce a space flip method to improve expressiveness in graph embeddings.

Result: The proposed methods—frequency signal scaler and space flip—demonstrate effectiveness in improving recommendation performance across experiments on four public datasets.

Conclusion: Both low- and high-frequency signals contribute equally to recommendations, and the proposed methods enable better exploitation of graph signal characteristics, enhancing GNN-based recommendation systems.

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLaDA2.0, a new type of large language model with up to 100 billion parameters, created by converting pre-trained auto-regressive models using an innovative 3-phase training method for efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing high-performing, efficient large language models without incurring the costs of training them from scratch, while enhancing scalability and deployment practicality.

Method: Transform pre-trained auto-regressive models into discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) using a novel 3-phase block-level training scheme, involving gradual block size increases, full-sequence diffusion, and compact block reduction. Models are additionally fine-tuned through SFT and DPO.

Result: The study produced two instruction-tuned models, LLaDA2.0-mini (16B parameters) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B parameters), which offer superior performance, efficiency, and are capable of practical application at scale.

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0 demonstrates an effective and scalable approach to developing large language models by leveraging existing pre-trained models, reducing training costs, and enabling parallel decoding capabilities for enhanced efficiency and performance.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

### [222] [A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15746)
*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Janus, a unified framework to tackle inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures, combining prediction and generation within a single latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of ill-posedness and computational expense in the inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures.

Method: Janus integrates a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive neural head, simultaneously optimizing for generative inversion and physics-informed prediction.

Result: Janus achieves high prediction accuracy ($R^2=0.98$), sub-5% reconstruction error, and generates inversed solutions satisfying target properties with under 1% relative error.

Conclusion: Janus simplifies physics-informed inverse microstructure generation with real-time capabilities at reduced computational costs compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

*Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides explicit and non-asymptotic query complexities for rank-based zeroth-order optimization algorithms, improving theoretical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in theoretical understanding of rank-based zeroth-order optimization methods, which previously lacked explicit convergence rates.

Method: The paper analyzes a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishes explicit query complexities for strongly convex and nonconvex problems, avoiding classical analysis methods.

Result: The algorithm achieves efficient query complexities for $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex functions, as well as nonconvex objectives, under probabilistic guarantees.

Conclusion: This study improves insight into the success and efficiency of rank-based ZO optimization heuristics through novel theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

*Javon Hickmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in zero-shot image classification using a proposed method called Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), which integrates CLIP and Stable Diffusion XL to improve performance by incorporating diverse demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accuracy and reduce demographic biases in zero-shot image classification tasks, especially addressing challenges like underfitting in fine-grained classification and bias due to unbalanced datasets.

Method: The authors propose the D3G method, a training-free, zero-shot strategy utilizing diverse demographic data during inference, leveraging CLIP as the multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as the generative model.

Result: The proposed method improves classification accuracy and reduces demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models by providing diverse demographic data at inference time.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse demographic data at inference time enhances performance and mitigates bias in multimodal models for zero-shot image classification.

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

TL;DR: The paper addresses data valuation for large language models (LLMs) using cooperative game theory, highlighting the efficiency of Shapley value calculations when leveraged with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data-related decisions and collaborations in training LLMs while addressing the high computational costs of valuing data contributions.

Method: Employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to simplify and scale the computation of Shapley values for data valuation in LLM training.

Result: Shapley value computation becomes significantly more efficient for LLMs when applying the DPO framework.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for integrating efficient data valuation with LLMs, offering promising new applications in collaborative and investment-based model training.

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

*Roman Akramov,Artem Khamatullin,Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract discusses optimizing the number of topics ($T$) in LDA models using four methods, focusing on their sample and time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the process of selecting the topic number ($T$) in LDA, aiming for better statistical fit and interpretability under a limited evaluation budget.

Method: This work compares traditional evolutionary methods (GA, ES) and learned amortized approaches (PABBO, SABBO) for optimizing $T$ in LDA models, evaluating their validation perplexity.

Result: Amortized approaches (SABBO, PABBO) outperform traditional methods in sample and time efficiency while achieving similar perplexity outcomes.

Conclusion: SABBO and PABBO are recommended for efficiently selecting $T$ in LDA due to their faster identification of optimal configurations.

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, Post-hoc Correction (POC), to enhance species recognition accuracy using a combination of few-shot learning (FSL) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of species-level recognition where annotated data is scarce, and traditional approaches like few-shot learning face limitations.

Method: The proposed POC approach uses an expert model trained via FSL and corrects its errors using LMMs, which re-rank predictions based on enriched prompts such as softmax confidence scores and few-shot examples.

Result: POC achieves a +6.4% accuracy improvement over existing FSL methods across five VSR benchmarks without extra training or manual intervention.

Conclusion: POC effectively combines the strengths of FSL and LMMs, generalizes across different backbones, and serves as a plug-and-play method for improving species recognition.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are extended using the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to enhance accuracy and manage Dirichlet boundary conditions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face accuracy issues and challenges with complex boundary conditions, motivating the need for improved optimization and enforcement methods.

Method: The TENG framework integrates natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping methods (Euler and Heun) and incorporates boundary constraint penalties into the loss function.

Result: Experiments on the heat equation show the Heun method's accuracy benefits and Euler's efficiency for simpler problems, advancing PINN capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves PINN accuracy, stability, and boundary condition handling, setting the stage for broader PDE applications and boundary types like Neumann and mixed conditions.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

*Abiel Kim*

TL;DR: The paper explores the behavior of ReLU networks under the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, focusing on the special case of extrapolation near the origin, uncovering quadratic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and investigate the extrapolation characteristics of ReLU MLPs under the NTK regime, particularly at the origin, where behavior differs from far-off extrapolation points.

Method: Theoretical and analysis-based examination of the extrapolation dynamics induced by the non-translationally invariant feature map of neural tangent kernels, focusing on both near-origin and far-off points.

Result: Reveals quadratic extrapolation behavior for ReLU NTKs specifically for test points close to the origin.

Conclusion: Extrapolation behavior of ReLU NTKs varies significantly based on proximity to the origin, with quadratic tendencies observable near the origin due to the neural tangent kernel's properties, motivating further specialized exploration in this area.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLOW, a framework aimed at improving performance predictions for Agentic Workflows (AWs) using a combination of graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods for predicting AW performance are ineffective as they fail to consider both the structural dependencies and semantic logic of AWs. An enhanced approach is required to enable scalable automation of AWs' generation.

Method: GLOW integrates graph-based modeling from GNNs with semantic reasoning from instruction-tuned LLMs. A contrastive alignment strategy optimizes latent space for distinguishing superior workflows.

Result: Experiments conducted on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW surpasses existing methods in accuracy and ranking utility for AW performance prediction.

Conclusion: GLOW demonstrates the potential for a more comprehensive and scalable approach to AW performance evaluation, effectively improving predictive accuracy by leveraging advanced graph reasoning and alignment techniques.

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAO-Net, a method designed for accurate classification of encrypted traffic, tackling both In-Distribution (ID) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic effectively, surpassing prior limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of emerging applications producing OOD traffic and the limitations of existing methods in handling unknown traffic with fine-grained classification.

Method: TAO-Net employs a two-stage design: (1) a hybrid OOD detection method utilizing transformer-based features, and (2) large language models with semantic-enhanced prompts to transform OOD classification into a generation task.

Result: TAO-Net surpasses prior methods, achieving macro-precision and macro-F1 scores between 96.81-97.70% across three datasets, significantly improving the classification of emerging network applications.

Conclusion: TAO-Net offers an innovative and robust solution to both ID and OOD traffic classification, demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements while enabling fine-grained classification of new applications.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a new approach to improve interpretability in data analysis using two new matrices, PKAN and MKAN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional and collinear datasets, which traditional methods like correlation analyses struggle to manage effectively.

Method: The authors developed two tools: the PKAN matrix for analyzing nonlinear pairwise relationships and the MKAN matrix for ranking multivariate features in predicting target variables.

Result: Experimental results show that PKAN and MKAN outperform Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information in revealing robust relationships and identifying hidden physical patterns.

Conclusion: KAN-based visualization tools improve dataset interpretability, enabling better feature selection, redundancy analysis, and domain-specific model insights.

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient algorithm for recovering feature directions and reconstructing a function from noisy oracle access under superposition conditions, overcoming challenges of overcompleteness and arbitrary response functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and recovering features from complex machine learning models encoded in superpositions is critical for advancements in interpretability and algorithmic solutions, particularly in overcomplete regimes.

Method: The proposed method uses an iterative refinement approach in Fourier space to identify feature directions and reconstruct the function efficiently, even under general and arbitrary superposition settings.

Conclusion: This study broadens the applicability of feature recovery methods to more generalized settings, providing efficient solutions for challenges in overcomplete feature representations.

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

*Yoonpyo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReactorFold is a novel generative framework leveraging language models to design nuclear reactor fuel assemblies, achieving breakthroughs in design-space exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reactor core design are limited by human-defined configuration spaces, restricting discovery of innovative designs.

Method: ReactorFold applies Monte Carlo simulations, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization to reformulate reactor design as a sequence modeling task for language models.

Result: The model autonomously adjusts design parameters, discovers unconventional asymmetric configurations, and expands design-space beyond traditional constraints.

Conclusion: ReactorFold demonstrates that language models can internalize causal physical relationships, opening new possibilities for innovative reactor design.

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

*Shu Wan,Reepal Shah,John Sabo,Huan Liu,K. Selçuk Candan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CauStream enhances streamflow forecasting by incorporating causal learning for better interpretability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for streamflow forecasting lack attention to physical processes, limiting their interpretability and adaptability.

Method: CauStream is a framework that learns causal runoff and routing graphs for spatiotemporal streamflow prediction, backed by theoretical identifiability conditions.

Result: CauStream consistently outperforms previous models across major U.S. river basins, especially for longer forecasts, and offers interpretable insights into hydrological relationships.

Conclusion: The framework presents a robust approach to causal modeling with applications in scientific and environmental domains while improving forecasting performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TMvRKM, a novel multiview learning model that enhances computational efficiency and classification performance by integrating kernel machine strengths with a regularized least squares approach and effective error balancing across views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve generalization performance in multi-view datasets by addressing challenges such as high-dimensional decision boundary capture, view inconsistencies, and computational inefficiencies in traditional kernel-based approaches.

Method: The paper proposes TMvRKM, which determines an optimal separating hyperplane using a regularized least squares approach instead of solving quadratic programming problems, and integrates early and late fusion strategies for leveraging information across multiple views.

Result: In experiments on UCI, KEEL, and AwA datasets, TMvRKM consistently shows superior generalization performance compared to baseline models, both in terms of results and statistical analyses.

Conclusion: TMvRKM effectively overcomes limitations of traditional multi-view approaches, achieving higher efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising solution for multi-view learning challenges.

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a method to model multivariate conditional distributions in a nonparametric way, emphasizing predictive uncertainty in AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty in fully nonparametric estimation of multivariate conditional distributions, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of AI systems.

Method: TQF models conditional quantiles of directional projections as functions of inputs and directions, reconstructing the multivariate conditional distribution using sliced Wasserstein distance minimization through an efficient convex optimization process.

Result: Experimentation demonstrates TQF's ability to function for different directions with a single model while avoiding the convexity restrictions of prior approaches. The code for implementation has been made publicly available.

Conclusion: TQF is a novel uncertainty-aware, tree-based approach for multivariate regression that exhibits strong performance and removes traditional constraints, contributing to advancements in predictive uncertainty modeling for AI.

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

### [239] [Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation: Convergence Theory and Privacy-Utility Bounds for Knowledge-Enhanced Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15759)
*Jahidul Arafat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a novel federated learning framework addressing convergence challenges under non-IID data by incorporating semantic constraints, achieving faster convergence and better privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning struggles with convergence under non-IID data conditions, and existing approaches fail to prioritize semantic validity of client updates. The paper seeks to address this gap using domain knowledge constraints.

Method: The paper introduces SCFA, a framework that integrates domain knowledge constraints in federated learning. It establishes a theory for convergence rates under constraint-based learning and evaluates SCFA using real-world manufacturing data, constructing knowledge graphs for constraint integration.

Result: Results show SCFA reduces data heterogeneity by 41%, improves privacy-utility tradeoffs, and achieves convergence 22% faster compared to standard methods. Rho thresholds for constraint violations are identified, indicating optimal and failure regions.

Conclusion: SCFA substantially enhances federated learning performance and privacy-utility tradeoffs under constrained conditions, validated both theoretically and empirically using large-scale industrial data.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

*Barna Pásztor,Thomas Kleine Buening,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a framework that frames preference optimization as a sequential-move game, offering advantages over existing approaches like RLHF and NLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment of AI with human preferences by addressing limitations in existing preference optimization methods such as RLHF and NLHF.

Method: SLHF frames preference optimization as a sequential game where a Leader policy commits to actions and a Follower policy refines responses. It introduces iterative sampling and inference-time refinement to improve alignment performance.

Result: SLHF demonstrates strong alignment across diverse datasets, effectively scales from smaller to larger language models, and achieves improved inference-time refinements transferable across different model families.

Conclusion: SLHF provides a novel framework for preference optimization that advances the alignment of AI systems, offering advantages in consistency, robustness, and data sensitivity compared to previous methods.

Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

*Dhruv Deshmukh,Saurabh Goyal,Nipun Kwatra,Ramachandran Ramjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method aimed at reducing latency during long-context LLM inference, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the latency issue caused by attention mechanisms in long-context LLM inference, which is critical for reasoning models and retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

Method: Kascade identifies and reuses high-weight keys in sparse attention across layers using exact Top-k indices computed in anchor layers, selected via dynamic programming, and optimized for efficient GPU implementation.

Result: Kascade achieves up to 4.1x increase in decode attention speed and 2.2x in prefill attention speed on H100 GPUs, maintaining comparable accuracy to dense attention on benchmarks like LongBench and AIME-24.

Conclusion: Kascade is an effective sparse attention method, offering significant speedups while closely matching dense attention performance, making it a practical solution for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

*Zhengtao Jake Gan,Xiaoyu Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dimensionless learning combines classical dimensional analysis with machine learning to derive compact physical laws that explain experimental data by identifying dimensionless groups. Regularization techniques aid interpretability and robustness under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a data-driven method that bridges dimensional analysis and machine learning to derive interpretable and precise physical laws from experimental data.

Method: The method integrates dimensional analysis with machine learning, using neural networks to identify dimensionless variables and employing regularization to assign interpretable coefficients. It also evaluates robustness against experimental noise and sampling issues.

Result: The framework can identify accurate, interpretable dimensionless groups even in noisy data or with multiple groups. It highlights equivalent representations of physical relationships.

Conclusion: Dimensionless learning is promising for deriving interpretable scaling laws but requires optimizations for complexity, automation, and usability to support wider adoption in experimental contexts.

Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

*Christopher Blum,Michael Neidlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to predict thrombosis risk using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-derived flow features, aiming to address limitations in current modeling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: An incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombosis initiation hinders accurate risk predictions with computational models in rotary blood pumps.

Method: The study employs a logistic regression model combined with a feature-selection pipeline to identify relevant flow features. The model is trained and validated using CFD-derived flow data and macro-scale thrombosis risk patterns.

Result: The model successfully identifies flow features related to thrombosis risk, reproduces risk distributions, and makes plausible thrombosis predictions for centrifugal pumps, despite training only on an axial pump scenario.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that interpretable machine learning can efficiently predict thrombosis risk, complementing traditional thrombosis modeling and improving the design and analysis workflows for blood pumps.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

*Kanxue Li,Yibing Zhan,Hua Jin,Chongchong Qi,Xu Lin,Baosheng Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSA-TTA, a novel framework to predict intraoperative hypotension events by leveraging data from other individuals to enhance test-time adaptation. The proposed method demonstrates improved performance and robustness on clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative hypotension is a critical issue during surgeries, with accurate prediction being hindered by patient-specific variations and the rarity of hypotensive events. Incorporating test-time adaptation tailored to these challenges motivated this study.

Method: The CSA-TTA incorporates a cross-sample augmented framework where historical data is segmented into hypotensive and non-hypotensive events. Then, a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy (using K-Shape clustering and similarity metrics) creates test-time training data, leveraging both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective forecasting.

Result: On clinical datasets (VitalDB and a real-world in-hospital dataset), CSA-TTA improved performance metrics. For example, on VitalDB, Recall and F1 increased by 1.33% and 1.13% in fine-tuning, and by 7.46% and 5.07%, respectively, in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: CSA-TTA offers an effective framework for personalized, robust prediction of intraoperative hypotension, showcasing superior generalization and adaptability in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity, fragmentation of data, and privacy concerns significantly hinder machine learning's potential in diagnosing rare diseases like COL6-RD. The authors aimed to overcome these issues using an innovative approach.

Method: The authors applied Federated Learning via the Sherpa.ai platform to train ML models across distributed datasets without centralizing private patient data. They used collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images for model training.

Result: Their Federated Learning model classified patient images into three key pathogenic mechanism groups with an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming traditional single-organization models that achieved 0.57-0.75.

Conclusion: Federated Learning significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy and generalizability of disease classification models, offering potential for variant interpretation and improved sequencing strategies.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

*Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta,Manisha Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents AdaGradSelect, a fine-tuning method for Small Language Models (SLMs) that adaptively chooses transformer blocks to update, achieving similar or better results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaGradSelect addresses the inefficiency and memory cost of full fine-tuning in LLMs and SLMs, aiming for a resource-efficient approach while maintaining or improving performance.

Method: AdaGradSelect selects transformer blocks to update based on gradient norms, using Dirichlet-based sampling and an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during training.

Result: AdaGradSelect delivers performance close to full fine-tuning, trains 12% faster, uses 35% less GPU memory, and outperforms LoRA on GSM8K and achieves comparable results on the MATH dataset.

Conclusion: AdaGradSelect is a more effective and resource-efficient alternative for fine-tuning SLMs, offering competitive performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.
  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.
  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.
  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

*M. Gorpinich,B. Moya,S. Rodriguez,F. Meraghni,Y. Jaafra,A. Briot,M. Henner,R. Leon,F. Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a hybrid twin approach to address discrepancies in physical simulations, improving accuracy and reducing data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrepancies exist between physics-based models and reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. Purely data-driven methods require extensive data and are impractical in real-world scenarios, motivating a hybrid approach to effectively manage this gap (termed ignorance model).

Method: The paper employs a hybrid twin framework where a physics-based model is supplemented by a data-driven ignorance model. The ignorance model is represented using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn and correct missing physics even from sparse spatial measurements.

Result: The proposed GNN-based approach effectively captures the missing physics (ignorance model), generalizes corrections across different spatial configurations, and improves simulation accuracy with minimal data requirements.

Conclusion: The GNN-based hybrid twin efficiently bridges knowledge gaps in physical simulations by learning corrections from sparse data, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability while minimizing data demands compared to purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

### [248] [TS-DP: Reinforcement Speculative Decoding For Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Policy Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15773)
*Ye Li,Jiahe Feng,Yuan Meng,Kangye Ji,Chen Tang,Xinwan Wen,Shutao Xia,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-DP, a framework improving Diffusion Policy performance in dynamic tasks, achieving faster inference rates with minimal loss of accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and high computational costs of Diffusion Policies in dynamic, temporal embodied control tasks, which current static methods and speculative decoding cannot effectively optimize.

Method: TS-DP employs a Transformer-based drafter to mimic the base model and uses a reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduler to adapt computational intensity dynamically based on task difficulty.

Result: TS-DP demonstrated up to 4.17 times faster inference, achieving real-time control at 25 Hz while maintaining over 94% draft acceptance and no performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework proves that adaptive and dynamic speculative decoding can significantly optimize Diffusion Policies for real-time, efficient, and accurate embodied task handling.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

*Avais Jan,Prakash Chourasia,Sarwan Ali,Murray Patterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates nine kernel functions for t-SNE in analyzing biological sequences, recommending the cosine similarity kernel for its superior overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the Gaussian kernel in scalability and similarity representation for categorical biological sequences when using t-SNE.

Method: Evaluated nine kernel functions across three embedding strategies (One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, minimizers) and tested them on six biological datasets using visualization, metrics, clustering, and classification tasks.

Result: The cosine similarity kernel outperforms other kernels in runtime efficiency, visualization quality, and downstream tasks for biological sequence analysis.

Conclusion: Cosine similarity kernel is optimal for t-SNE-based biological sequence analysis, improving both scalability and analytical accuracy.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

*Nuria Alina Chandra,Yucen Lily Li,Alan N. Amin,Alex Ali,Joshua Rollins,Sebastian W. Ober,Aniruddh Raghu,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper bridges discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion models for discrete sequence modeling under a unified theory based on the Wright-Fisher genetic model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify disparate methodologies for modeling discrete sequences and address tradeoffs faced by practitioners regarding domain choices and instability issues.

Method: The paper proposes a theoretical framework connecting discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion through the Wright-Fisher population model, enabling stable simplicial diffusion and flexibility across training domains.

Result: Wright-Fisher-based simplicial diffusion improves stability and outperforms previous models in conditional DNA generation. Furthermore, a unified model trained on multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance.

Conclusion: By unifying the diffusion approaches under the Wright-Fisher framework, the study resolves domain trade-offs and provides tools for stable and generalizable sequence modeling.

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

*Lucas Monteiro Paes,Nivedha Sivakumar,Yinong Oliver Wang,Masha Fedzechkina Donaldson,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Direct Steering Optimization (DSO), a reinforcement-learning-based method for reducing bias in generative models during inference, while balancing performance and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of biased outcomes in vision-language and large language models (e.g., failing to identify women as doctors) and provide users control over balancing bias mitigation with model performance.

Method: The proposed method, DSO, uses reinforcement learning to discover linear transformations for steering model activations during inference, aimed at controlling biases and maintaining model performance.

Result: DSO outperforms existing steering methods in achieving a better balance between fairness and performance for both vision-language and large language models, and allows user-controllable bias interventions during inference.

Conclusion: Directly optimizing steering strategies, rather than relying on pre-defined heuristics, is a more effective method for bias reduction in generative models, enabling better trade-offs between fairness and model capabilities.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of accurate taxonomic classification of fungi, a critical aspect of biodiversity monitoring, hindered by limited labeled data and complex taxonomic structures.

Method: The paper employs a state-space model architecture with a pretrain-and-fine-tune strategy, integrating hierarchical label smoothing, weighted loss functions, and a MycoAI multi-head output layer.

Result: BarcodeMamba+ demonstrates superior performance over existing classification methods on a fungal classification benchmark, achieving improvements across all taxonomic levels.

Conclusion: The research establishes BarcodeMamba+ as an effective tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and provides a scalable training framework for fungal taxonomy studies. The associated code has also been made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore why Transformers perform well even in the absence of abundant labeled data and understand how they leverage unlabeled context for effective learning.

Method: They study the IC-SSL paradigm where a few labeled examples are combined with many unlabeled ones in a Transformer-based framework.

Result: Transformers can use unlabeled data to learn robust context-based representations, leading to better predictive accuracy, particularly in low-label scenarios.

Conclusion: This study provides foundational insights into in-context semi-supervised learning, offering a better understanding of how Transformer models exploit unlabeled data for representation learning.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of interpreting and controlling deep neural networks, aiming for transparent and actionable AI systems.

Method: The method involves using a sparse autoencoder to discover features, validating them with a saliency mapping (Grad-FAM), and then controlling models through precise weight-space interventions and diagnostics (e.g., suppression threshold).

Result: SALVE is validated on convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, showing effective, interpretable control over their behaviors.

Conclusion: The study presents a unified methodology to discover, validate, and edit models, advancing the interpretability and controllability of AI systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

### [256] [Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16911)
*Andrew Wagenmaker,Perry Dong,Raymond Tsao,Chelsea Finn,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning by ensuring better initialization of pretrained policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard behavioral cloning (BC) in ensuring effective initialization for RL finetuning, which is crucial for achieving superior performance in robotics and related domains.

Method: The method involves a theoretical analysis highlighting limitations of BC, followed by the development of PostBC. PostBC trains a policy to model the posterior distribution of a demonstrator’s behavior rather than just replicating observed demonstrations. It leverages modern generative models with standard supervised learning.

Result: PostBC ensures better coverage over the demonstrator's actions, leading to more effective RL finetuning. Empirical results show significant improvements in robotic control benchmarks and real-world tasks compared to standard BC.

Conclusion: PostBC provides an effective solution for initializing policies for RL finetuning, outperforming BC, while maintaining pretrained performance. It is feasible with current supervised learning techniques and generative models.

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of decision-tree methods on tabular data, particularly focusing on predictors regulated by privacy laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing privacy regulations on data, the research aims to assess the real-world use of legally governed data in decision-tree methods, using published studies.

Method: The authors compile a corpus of decision-tree studies, categorize predictors into regulated data types, and link them to EU and US privacy laws.

Result: Many predictors in decision-tree studies fall under regulated categories, notably in healthcare, with clear variability across industries and time.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, offering insights for ML practices beyond decision trees.

Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable and cost-effective method using commodity RFID for tracking assets in forests for wildfire response, achieving GPS-like accuracy without tagging known locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing RFID tags in forested environments despite limitations like signal attenuation, multi-path effects, and environmental variability, especially for wildfire response scenarios.

Method: The use of Gaussian Process to model environments based on RF signal signatures without advanced sensors (like GPS or cameras) and a weighted log-likelihood technique to link unknown RF signals to a modeled dictionary.

Result: Achieved GPS-like localization accuracy using passive RFID systems, overcoming the need for pre-tagged known positions.

Conclusion: This approach allows cost-effective, efficient tracking of wildfire assets using commodity RFID, offering scalability and practicality in difficult environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a framework that optimizes low-rank factorization in self-attention layers of LLMs using reinforcement learning and matrix perturbation theory, achieving adaptable rank selection and computational efficiency without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most traditional low-rank approximations in self-attention layers are static and inflexible, which limits their adaptability to varying input contexts. The study aims to address this limitation by introducing dynamic rank selection for better computational efficiency without compromising performance.

Method: The proposed DR-RL framework integrates reinforcement learning for dynamic rank selection and online matrix perturbation theory for efficient rank updates. A lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched SVD operations ensure scalability during inference on GPUs.

Result: DR-RL achieves statistically equivalent accuracy to full-rank attention while reducing FLOPs significantly, particularly beneficial for long-sequence inputs exceeding 4096 tokens.

Conclusion: DR-RL combines adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor, providing a principled alternative to heuristic rank reduction methods in MHSA for resource-constrained scenarios without compromising downstream accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

TL;DR: This paper improves reduced-order models (ROMs) for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs) by proposing a more reliable and efficient approach for long-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome the limitations of reduced-order models (ROMs), whose accuracy diminishes over long time horizons in predictive modeling for parametric PDEs.

Method: The proposed method introduces a high-order, cost-effective finite-difference scheme and a new Rollout loss for training ROMs to maintain accuracy over extended time horizons.

Result: Through application to the 2D Burgers equation, the method shows improved accuracy and stability in long-term predictions compared to traditional ROM techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy enhances reduced-order modeling efficiency and reliability, solving limitations in long-term predictive PDE simulations.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate quantification of carbon cycles is critical for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture, but existing approaches struggle with spatial variability and transfer learning due to heterogeneous data and cross-scale dependencies.

Method: FTBSC-KGML uses pretraining-fine-tuning with site-specific parameters, remote-sensing data, and a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme to improve accuracy in land emissions estimation.

Result: FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and enhanced explanatory power compared to conventional models, capturing spatial variability more effectively.

Conclusion: FTBSC-KGML provides a novel solution for quantifying carbon cycles with improved local accuracy and interpretability by leveraging spatial variability and transfer learning.

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

*Paul Seurin,Dean Price,Luis Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Microreactors, specifically heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), face economic challenges despite their suitability for remote areas. This paper proposes a novel design optimization method reducing LCOE by over 57%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPMRs are compact, transportable systems ideal for remote areas but face economic and scalability challenges.

Method: Combines surrogate modeling (GPs, MLPs) and reinforcement learning-based optimization to minimize LCOE, adhering to constraints.

Result: Optimized design reduces LCOE by more than 57% while adhering to specific physical and economic constraints.

Conclusion: Novel design approach demonstrates promise in addressing economic viability challenges of HPMRs, enabling further optimization for cost and performance.

Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

### [265] [In-Context Multi-Operator Learning with DeepOSets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16074)
*Shao-Ting Chiu,Aditya Nambiar,Ali Syed,Jonathan W. Siegel,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that the DeepOSets architecture can perform in-context learning (ICL) for PDE solution operators without weight updates and establishes its universality as a uniform approximator for a class of continuous operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the ICL capabilities of the DeepOSets architecture for solving PDE-related problems, particularly to show that it can learn and approximate operators in-context without relying on the typical transformer-based self-attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors enhance the DeepOSets architecture, building on its set learning and operator learning properties, and show it is capable of recovering PDE solution operators (not seen during training) from in-context examples provided in prompts, eliminating the need for weight updates.

Result: The paper shows that DeepOSets is a universal approximator of continuous operators and demonstrates, through experiments with boundary-value problems, its ability to accurately infer solutions for unseen PDEs using example-based prompts.

Conclusion: DeepOSets, with its unique design, is proven to possess general ICL capabilities across a class of continuous operators, advancing the functionality and scope of scientific machine learning models while offering a weight-update-free solution for PDE operator learning.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

### [266] [Privacy Blur: Quantifying Privacy and Utility for Image Data Release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16086)
*Saeed Mahloujifar,Narine Kokhlikyan,Chuan Guo,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian blurring, a common method for obfuscating private information in images, is shown to be vulnerable to reversal attacks, compromising privacy. Other methods like pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix) offer better privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for methods that can obfuscate private information in image data while preserving data usability for tasks like model training.

Method: The paper evaluates four obfuscation methods — Gaussian blurring, pixelization, DP-Pix, and cropping — using reversal and discrimination attacks to assess privacy, and representation quality to assess utility.

Result: Gaussian blurring is the least secure due to its vulnerability to reversal attacks. Pixelization and DP-Pix, when applied with appropriate granularity, provide better privacy and utility.

Conclusion: Gaussian blurring is not an effective method for securing private information in images. Alternative methods such as pixelization and DP-Pix offer improved privacy without significantly compromising data utility, and the authors provide a software package, Privacy Blur, for practical implementation.

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

*Sandeep Neela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIMM, an AI framework to assess social media-driven market manipulation risks by analyzing Reddit activity, bot coordination patterns, and market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing influence of coordinated social media campaigns on market manipulation, providing tools for retail investors, regulators, and brokerages to monitor and predict such activity.

Method: AIMM analyzes Reddit activity, bot/coordination indicators, and market data (OHLCV) to calculate daily Manipulation Risk Scores for tickers. It integrates synthetic social features and real historical market data into its pipeline.

Result: AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak. It shows preliminary discriminative capability on a small dataset (33 ticker-days, 3 manipulation cases).

Conclusion: While the current labeled set is limited, AIMM demonstrates potential in identifying market manipulation early, supporting further research in social media-driven market surveillance.

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

### [268] [BUILD with Precision: Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16111)
*Hamed Ajorlou,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Geert Leus,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BUILD, a deterministic stepwise algorithm for accurately reconstructing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) under linear Gaussian settings using a distinctive structure in their precision matrices. BUILD shows competitive performance against existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of learning DAG structures from observational data in fields like causal discovery and machine learning, leveraging a unique property of linear Gaussian SEMs with equal noise variances.

Method: The method involves a deterministic algorithm (BUILD) that identifies leaf nodes in a DAG and their relationships, reconstructing the DAG by iteratively pruning leaves and updating precision matrices to improve robustness amid estimation challenges.

Result: The results demonstrate BUILD's competitive performance on synthetic benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, providing reproducible outcomes and controlled complexity.

Conclusion: BUILD offers an effective approach for DAG recovery with explicit control over runtime and robustness, showing promise in advancing causal discovery and related applications.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

### [269] [Dual-View Inference Attack: Machine Unlearning Amplifies Privacy Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16126)
*Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Linqiang Qian,Peijin Guo,Yechao Zhang,Minghui Li,Yanjun Zhang,Dayong Ye,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning can lead to amplified privacy leakage of retained data when adversaries use dual views (original and unlearned models) strategically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning primarily ensures compliance with data deletion requests but fails to adequately address privacy risks to retained training data, especially in dual-view scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces DVIA (Dual-View Inference Attack), leveraging black-box queries to the original and unlearned models without training an attack model. A lightweight likelihood ratio inference module is utilized.

Result: DVIA effectively demonstrates membership inference attacks on retained data across different datasets and model architectures, revealing amplified privacy risks associated with the dual-view setting.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning, although beneficial for data deletion compliance, could unintentionally amplify privacy risks under dual-view settings, calling for a reassessment of its privacy implications.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

Abstract: We present INTELLECT-3, a 106B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model (12B active) trained with large-scale reinforcement learning on our end-to-end RL infrastructure stack. INTELLECT-3 achieves state of the art performance for its size across math, code, science and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming many larger frontier models. We open-source the model together with the full infrastructure stack used to create it, including RL frameworks, complete recipe, and a wide collection of environments, built with the verifiers library, for training and evaluation from our Environments Hub community platform. Built for this effort, we introduce prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use. Using this stack, we run both SFT and RL training on top of the GLM-4.5-Air-Base model, scaling RL training up to 512 H200s with high training efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework using graph structures derived from cube-copying drawings, combined with demographic, task scores, and machine learning for Alzheimer's disease detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome clinical challenges in early, accessible, and interpretable detection of Alzheimer's disease, utilizing simple visuospatial tasks like cube-copying.

Method: Transforms hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured data encoded with spatial, topological, and geometric properties. These are processed using graph neural networks combined with demographic and neuropsychological data in a late-fusion model.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of graph-based models over pixel-based ones and improved robustness when integrating multimodal inputs. SHAP analysis highlights relevant graph patterns consistent with clinical observations.

Conclusion: Graph-based cube-copying analysis serves as an effective, interpretable, and scalable screening tool for Alzheimer's disease, offering new promise for non-invasive detection methods.

Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

*Jianping Mei,Siqi Ai,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spatial transcriptomics analysis faces challenges in identifying spatial domains due to complex interactions. The proposed stMFG model uses multi-scale fusion graph networks and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial analysis methods treat spatial and gene features separately, reducing the ability to capture multi-scale semantic information and interaction.

Method: stMFG introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to merge spatial and gene features dynamically, combined with cross-view contrastive learning and spatial constraints.

Result: stMFG delivers up to 14% improvement in Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) on datasets such as DLPFC and breast cancer.

Conclusion: The model enhances spatial transcriptomics analysis by resolving spatial-gene feature integration, achieving state-of-the-art results with increased discriminability and spatial continuity.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

*Lorenzo Nava,Ye Chen,Maximillian Van Wyk de Vries*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning model that predicts geohazard runout (like landslides) with high accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the predictive capability of geohazard models to protect lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems from mass flow hazards, which are difficult to predict due to complex factors influencing their behaviors.

Method: A machine learning model was trained using over 100,000 numerical simulations of geohazard events across 10,000 real-world terrains. It predicts flow extent and deposit thickness while maintaining physical realism and efficiency.

Result: The model achieved 100 to 10,000 times faster computation speed compared to numerical solvers and successfully reproduced key physical behaviors while generalizing across different flow types, sizes, and terrains.

Conclusion: The work shows neural emulation as a transformative approach for geohazard runout prediction, making early warning systems more feasible at large spatial and temporal scales to support disaster risk reduction.

Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents the Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) method for enhanced OOD detection and classification in GNNs using semantic OOD instances and LLM prompts, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for effective open-set classification methods in scenarios where accurate OOD detection and classification are crucial, such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis.

Method: The proposed CFC framework combines a coarse classification using LLM prompts, a GNN-based fine classifier for improved detection and classification, and refined OOD classification with post-processed labels.

Result: CFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving OOD detection by 10% on graph and text domains, and achieves up to 70% accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Conclusion: CFC offers a practical and interpretable solution for OOD detection and classification, enhancing GNN deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

TL;DR: DataFlow is a scalable and modular data preparation framework for large language models, offering improved pipelines and performance in several applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of ad-hoc and unstructured data preparation workflows, which hinder reproducibility and lack model-in-the-loop capabilities.

Method: The DataFlow framework provides a modular PyTorch-style API with almost 200 operators, six general pipelines, and a DataFlow-Agent for automatic pipeline construction via natural language specifications.

Result: The framework demonstrated consistent improvement in LLM performance, surpassing baseline datasets and human-curated ones in areas like Text-to-SQL, coding, and mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: DataFlow is a reliable, scalable, and high-performance framework for data preparation, which enables reproducibility and better performance, forming a foundation for future data-centric AI systems.

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SEAL, a federated graph learning algorithm addressing privacy concerns and improving generalization and classification in GNNs by focusing on sharpness minimization and avoiding dimensional collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in federated graph learning (FGL) caused by data heterogeneity among clients, privacy concerns, weak generalization, and dimensional collapse in existing solutions.

Method: SEAL optimizes GNN performance by minimizing both the loss function and its sharpness, finding flat regions with consistently low loss, and introducing a regularizer based on correlation matrices to avoid dimensional collapse in learned representations.

Result: SEAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art FGL baselines in terms of classification accuracy and generalization across multiple graph classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SEAL algorithm improves the performance of federated graph learning systems by addressing data heterogeneity challenges, enhancing generalization, and boosting classification accuracy through novel optimization techniques.

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

*Rahul Bhargava,Malene Hornstrup Jespersen,Emily Boardman Ndulue,Vivica Dsouza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in AI trained on historic news corpora, focusing on the New York Times Annotated Corpus, revealing issues with outdated attitudes encoded in models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and analyze historical biases embedded in AI models trained on large-scale corpora and their impact on research and newsroom applications.

Method: Prepares a multi-label classifier using the New York Times Annotated Corpus, applying explainable AI methods to investigate thematic biases and examining the use of the "blacks" thematic label through both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

Result: Finds that the "blacks" label serves partially as a racism detector but fails to appropriately classify modern phenomena like anti-Asian hate or reports on Black Lives Matter, demonstrating limitations and biases in context-specific outputs.

Conclusion: Highlights the risks of adopting AI tools with embedded biases in newsroom workflows, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate historical prejudice in news coverage and AI-model application.

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

*Jialiang Wang,Xueyan Bao,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model, which enhances the Second-order Latent Factor model with a sharpness term for better optimization in non-convex objectives. It outperforms existing methods in experiments on industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the optimization challenges of the Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model due to its bilinear and non-convex nature and to improve representation learning performance.

Method: The proposed SSLF model acquires second-order information using Hessian-vector products and enhances the optimization process by integrating a sharpness term into the curvature via these products.

Result: Experiments on multiple industrial datasets show that the SSLF model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Conclusion: The SSLF model effectively addresses the optimization difficulties of SLF models, demonstrating stronger performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jinhao Zhang,Yunquan Zhang,Daning Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free method that uses CKA metrics to optimize quantization strategies for large language models at the layer level, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream post-training quantization methods do not account for the algorithmic variability among different LLM layers, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The proposed framework selects optimal quantization strategies for each layer using Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) analysis, enabling heterogeneous quantization.

Result: Experiments show that the method outperforms uniform baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods in perplexity and downstream task performance for models like LLaMA and Qwen.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, efficient, layer-aware quantization method that improves performance without needing fine-tuning, making it better suited for LLMs.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

*Peter Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Ziniu Li,Wotao Yin,Xi Chen,Tianyi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the exploration-exploitation trade-off in improving reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). It finds that mechanisms like spurious rewards and entropy minimization paradoxically enhance reasoning, revealing how clipping bias and model contamination impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplained phenomenon where contradictory mechanisms in RLVR (spurious rewards and entropy minimization) paradoxically cooperate to improve mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models.

Method: Analyzed how policy entropy relates to performance and explored the role of spurious rewards through mechanisms such as clipping bias and model contamination. Proposed a reward-misalignment model to explain spurious rewards' effects and tested their impact on model outputs.

Result: Demonstrated that clipping bias in spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, fostering confident and deterministic outputs. Showed that entropy minimization alone does not fully explain performance improvement and devised a theoretical framework linking spurious rewards to gains beyond model contamination.

Conclusion: Clarified how spurious rewards and entropy minimization enhance reasoning performance in RLVR. Provided a theoretical foundation and practical principles for designing more efficient methods to train Large Language Models using RL mechanisms effectively.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

*Taozhao Chen,Linghan Huang,Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRMU is a proposed method to achieve selective unlearning in large language models under conditions of data overlap and entanglement, maintaining model utility and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of LLMs in sensitive and regulated areas raises risks such as privacy leakage, misuse, and regulatory non-compliance. Machine unlearning methods are increasingly needed to tackle these problems, especially under challenging operational conditions.

Method: The authors introduced Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU). This framework utilizes activation importance mapping and directionally-controlled perturbations instead of indiscriminate weight perturbations to selectively suppress harmful data while preserving benign representations.

Result: Experimental validation using the WMDP benchmark demonstrated that SRMU achieves state-of-the-art performance in unlearning with low utility loss, even in high data entanglement scenarios where previous methods fail.

Conclusion: SRMU offers a robust solution for safety-oriented model governance, privacy compliance, and selective knowledge removal in LLM applications, even under conditions of overlapping data distributions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first foundation model for battery life prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results through transfer learning on diverse lithium-ion battery datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges caused by data scarcity and heterogeneity in predicting battery cycle life, by developing a generalizable foundation model inspired by successes in other fields.

Method: The authors developed the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT) using domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers to learn transferable representations from 13 diverse lithium-ion battery datasets.

Result: PBT outperformed existing models by an average of 19.8% and achieved state-of-the-art performance across 15 datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize across various operating conditions and battery types.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of foundation models like PBT in battery research, establishing a path toward universal systems for predicting battery lifetime.

Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.

*Zhenjiang Zhao,Takahisa Toda,Takashi Kitamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on an efficient quantification technique for verifying fairness in tree ensembles, providing better bounds on counterexamples and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fairness verification in machine learning models, specifically addressing limitations in traditional methods that do not quantify or effectively diagnose bias regions, and exploring tree ensembles beyond DNNs.

Method: The authors propose exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles to develop a quantification technique providing both upper and lower bounds efficiently. This adapts and improves upon existing abstraction refinement frameworks.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrate the method's ability to outperform current state-of-the-art fairness testing techniques in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed quantification approach establishes a significant advancement in fairness verification for tree ensembles, delivering better diagnostics and addressing the limitations of existing frameworks.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method to optimize irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, enhancing crop yield and resource efficiency amidst challenges in precision and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the dual challenges of high complexity in optimizing water-nitrogen combinations and the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals, which impacts crop yield and resource utilization efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent identifies macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions, while the child agent integrates stress factors to dynamically optimize strategies. They simulate real-world conditions with DSSAT using field data.

Result: The simulation demonstrated a 4.7% increase in yield, 5.6% and 5.1% improvement in water productivity, and 6.3% and 1.0% improvement in nitrogen productivity for 2023 and 2024 respectively compared to the best baseline.

Conclusion: The NDRL method is effective in improving yield and resource efficiency, addressing precision and complexity issues in water-nitrogen optimization, and contributing to sustainable agricultural development.

Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), overcoming limitations of existing operator learning methods for aperiodic dynamics and irregular spaces. The approach shows improved performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators struggle with handling non-periodic dynamics, transient signals, and non-Euclidean geometries. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The framework uses a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions for modeling dynamics. The GLNO integrates Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and is implemented via a grid-invariant architecture called GLNONet.

Result: The proposed methods achieve robust performance on PDEs, ODEs, and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: GLNO and GLNONet provide a generalized operator learning framework for handling aperiodic and irregular dynamics, addressing shortcomings of previous approaches.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

### [286] [Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance: hierarchical MCMC sampling for Bayesian inverse problems combining multiple solvers through deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16430)
*Filippo Zacchei,Paolo Conti,Attilio Alberto Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-fidelity delayed acceptance strategy combining low- and high-fidelity models using neural networks to improve Bayesian inverse problems' efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of inverse uncertainty quantification tasks, particularly when using high-cost physics-based models and high-fidelity data, which make traditional sampling approaches like MCMC infeasible.

Method: The method uses multi-fidelity neural networks within a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme to integrate low- and high-fidelity model predictions. High-fidelity evaluations occur offline during training, whereas likelihood evaluations online use coarse solvers combined with trained neural networks, bypassing additional high-fidelity simulations.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and faster posterior inference. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems, yielding substantial computational savings.

Conclusion: The approach enhances accuracy and flexibility in incorporating low-fidelity solvers while significantly reducing computation costs, thus offering an efficient solution to Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

*Maeve Madigan,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Glenn Moynihan,Tom Kempton,David Sutton,Stuart Burrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-agent systems can improve predictive tasks but pose fairness risks, especially in finance. Novel methodologies are required to measure and address bias. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for better evaluation techniques to assess fairness in multi-agent systems, especially in high-stakes domains like finance where biased decisions can lead to regulatory issues and financial loss.

Method: Large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations were used to examine fairness metrics and emergent biases, emphasizing collective behaviors.

Result: Emergent biases in multi-agent systems were discovered that do not arise from individual agents but from collective behaviors, impacting financial tasks like credit scoring.

Conclusion: Fairness risks in multi-agent financial systems must be treated as a holistic concern, emphasizing the need for system-wide evaluation methods rather than focusing solely on individual agents.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-based framework employing CNN and HOSVD to rapidly classify Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia cells via the IoMT structure, achieving 98.88% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in manual diagnostic procedures for ALL, including human error and time, by leveraging AI for rapid and precise leukemia diagnosis.

Method: The paper utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) for classification, implemented within an IoMT structure.

Result: The model was tested on the ALL-IDB2 dataset and achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98.88% in identifying ALL cells.

Conclusion: This framework enhances leukemia diagnosis by offering real-time monitoring and communication between patients and clinicians, demonstrating high efficiency in classification.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

*Pengfei Sun,Wenyu Jiang,Piew Yoong Chee,Paul Devos,Dick Botteldooren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a batch normalization-free fully integer quantised neural network trained through a progressive layer-wise distillation scheme, achieving competitive accuracy using integer-only inference on low-bit architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantised neural networks depend on batch normalization layers that limit integer-only inference and deployment, creating a need for true integer-based models without stability or accuracy degradation.

Method: The method involves a progressive, layer-wise distillation approach using pretrained teacher models with batch normalization to train a student network that is batch normalization-free and supports integer-only computation.

Result: The proposed quantisation scheme achieves competitive accuracy under aggressive quantization settings, tested on ImageNet with AlexNet architecture.

Conclusion: The introduced approach allows end-to-end integer-only inference on constrained devices, integrating seamlessly with standard quantisation pipelines while eliminating reliance on batch normalization.

Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

Conclusion: PLSCAN improves flexibility and performance in density-based clustering, making it useful for exploratory analysis without requiring prior data distribution knowledge.

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

*Sullivan Castro,Artem Betlei,Thomas Di Martino,Nadir El Manouzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of modeling user purchase behavior in display advertising by introducing Abacus, a pretraining approach that leverages event frequency distribution. It improves predictive systems and yields significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to handle the sparsity of positive user events and irregular timing, relying on hand-crafted features that overlook temporal evolution.

Method: They propose Abacus, predicting user event frequency distribution, and a hybrid objective combining stability of statistics with sequence modeling sensitivity.

Result: Experiments show improved task convergence and up to +6.1% AUC boost from the hybrid approach compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions effectively enhance predictive models for display advertising, addressing class imbalance and stochastic user behavior challenges.

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

*Liu Yang,Qiang Li,Luxiong Wen,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of adapting deep learning-based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) models across receivers with different hardware without source-domain data by introducing the MS-SHOT method for reliable adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve secure device authentication using RFFI models by tackling performance degradation caused by receiver hardware differences and distribution shifts.

Method: The paper formulates a constrained pseudo-labeling-based framework for adaptation and proposes the MS-SHOT method, which uses momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and global structural constraints.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show that MS-SHOT outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness for RFFI adaptation.

Conclusion: MS-SHOT offers a scalable and effective solution for cross-receiver adaptation of RFFI models without requiring access to source-domain data, overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

TL;DR: CLARiTy, a vision transformer model, enhances multi-label chest X-ray pathology classification and weakly-supervised localization using class-specific attention tokens and SegmentCAM module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accurate multi-label pathology classification and localization in chest X-rays, particularly due to limited region-level annotations.

Method: A vision transformer model named CLARiTy utilizes class-specific tokens, SegmentCAM for anatomical guidance, ConvNeXtV2 teacher distillation, and other advanced techniques for efficient classification and localization.

Result: CLARiTy-S-16-512 achieves competitive classification across 14 pathologies and state-of-the-art localization in 8 pathologies, surpassing prior methods by 50.7%, especially for small pathologies.

Conclusion: CLARiTy exhibits robustness and efficiency in pathology classification and localization, leveraging advanced self-attention and anatomical segmentation techniques, with potential applications in low-resource settings.

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

Motivation: Phishing attacks are a persistent and evolving cybersecurity risk, necessitating advanced detection methods to counter evolving attacker strategies.

Method: The authors developed an ensemble model combining a character-level CNN and LightGBM with 36 URL-related features for phishing detection. They use FastAPI to provide a real-time detection interface.

Result: The model exhibited exceptional performance with 99.819% accuracy, 100% precision, 99.635% recall, and 99.947% ROC-AUC, surpassing the performance of individual models.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble system accurately detects phishing URLs while minimizing false positives, effectively addressing modern phishing tactics and outperforming standalone models.

Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

TL;DR: This paper extends a previous regression problem solution using random function theory to propose a cascade architecture for scalability and handling low intrinsic dimensionality efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational and dimensionality limitations in applying the polyharmonic spline solution to machine learning regression problems.

Method: A cascade architecture composed of polyharmonic splines is developed to address scalability and dimensional constraints. Efficient matrix procedures enable computational advantages and differentiation.

Result: The proposed architecture is theoretically justified and computationally efficient for regression problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Conclusion: The cascade architecture enhances scalability and practicality of machine learning regression with polyharmonic splines while maintaining theoretical soundness.

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOSS is a novel selective state space model that leverages Kalman gain for context-aware information selection, outperforming existing models in sequence tasks and forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSMs like Mamba lack theoretical grounds for their input-dependent selection mechanisms and fail in context-aware latent state dynamics.

Method: KOSS introduces a Kalman-optimal selection mechanism that minimizes latent state uncertainty using a dynamic Kalman gain in a closed-loop context-aware framework.

Result: KOSS surpasses baselines with over 79% accuracy in selective copying tasks and achieves up to 36.23% improvement in MSE across forecasting benchmarks. It also proves robust in real-world applications like SSR tracking.

Conclusion: The Kalman-optimized approach provides robust theoretical foundation and practical improvements in context-aware sequence modeling and forecasting.

Abstract: Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat the rise of digital fraud and counterfeit applications in the increasingly digitalized religious services sector, which impact privacy and financial security.

Method: Machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes) were applied to app data using hybrid feature extraction—textual analysis (TF-IDF) and metadata analysis of access permissions.

Result: SVM outperformed other classifiers with 92.3% accuracy, 91.5% precision, and 92.0% F1-score. Keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions were significant discriminators.

Conclusion: This approach provides an effective, scalable mechanism for verifying Hajj and Umrah apps, promoting digital trust and suggesting a prototype for a national verification system.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine GPT's architecture with energy-based modeling (EBM) and explore its potential advantages in language modeling.

Method: NRGPT modifies GPT by integrating EBM, conceptualizing inference as token exploration on an energy landscape, and proves that under certain conditions, this process aligns with gradient descent.

Result: NRGPT performs well across tasks like Shakespeare language modeling, algebraic ListOPS, and OpenWebText, with observed resistance to overfitting during prolonged training.

Conclusion: Integrating energy-based concepts into GPT retains strong performance, provides insights into language modeling dynamics, and may help address overfitting issues.

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and analyzing high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics of complex systems, which exhibit emergent behaviors and are challenging to model using traditional approaches.

Method: The paper introduces a geometric framework involving a two-parameter family of metrics for analyzing spatio-temporal data. The approach includes time-dependent images, image gradients, and functions on graphs or simplicial complexes, validated through simulations.

Result: The proposed metrics effectively enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterization, demonstrated via biological and physical simulation data.

Conclusion: The findings provide a robust solution for studying complex dynamical systems, proving useful when experimental data are abundant but traditional modeling methods are impractical.

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEPIC, a memory-efficient position-independent caching (PIC) system to optimize Key Value (KV) caching for modern LLM applications, reducing memory usage significantly while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in KV cache operations for long prompts in modern LLM applications like RAG systems, which face challenges with memory constraints and high computational demands.

Method: MEPIC employs techniques such as page-aligned chunk KV storage, block-level recomputation, removal of positional encodings using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), and fully shareable block designs to optimize memory use and maintain performance.

Result: MEPIC achieves significant reductions in duplicate chunk KV memory usage, offering up to 2x improvement in memory efficiency over other PIC methods and up to 5x efficiency for longer prompts, without compromising on latency or accuracy.

Conclusion: MEPIC provides a robust solution for effectively managing memory in LLM KV caching systems, accomplishing considerable memory savings and maintaining optimal performance without requiring modifications to existing LLM models.

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

TL;DR: Tiny Recursive Control (TRC) is a neural network approach for aerospace systems, leveraging iteration depth over parameter count for compact and efficient control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive scaling requirements of neural network controllers in embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints.

Method: Developed TRC, which uses compact neural networks repeatedly through a hierarchical latent structure for control sequence refinement, emphasizing iteration depth to enhance capacity without increasing memory.

Result: TRC delivers near-optimal control performance on nonlinear tasks like oscillator stabilization and powered descent, achieving minimal memory use (under 10MB) and fast inference within milliseconds.

Conclusion: Recursive reasoning can effectively transition to continuous control tasks, enabling efficient and compact solutions suitable for constrained systems.

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-trained Large Language Model agents often underperform in tasks requiring exploration and efficient adaptation, motivating the need for a framework that enables better test-time learning from trial-and-error.

Method: The paper introduces LaMer, which includes a cross-episode training framework for exploration and reward optimization and an in-context policy adaptation mechanism allowing adaptation from task feedback without gradient updates.

Result: Experiments show performance improvements of 11%, 14%, and 19% on Sokoban, MineSweeper, and Webshop, respectively, along with enhanced generalization to unseen or challenging tasks.

Conclusion: LaMer demonstrates the effectiveness of Meta-RL in fostering exploration in LLM agents, enabling robust adaptation and improved handling of novel environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

Conclusion: KT is beneficial for scenarios with generic teacher tasks using pre-trained models or when acquiring labels for student tasks is difficult or expensive.

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in Continual Learning by proposing optimal task sequencing, enhancing performance and mitigating forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable intelligent systems to adapt to real-world settings and sustain knowledge incrementally throughout their lifetime while overcoming catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors develop a zero-shot scoring algorithm inspired by neural architecture search (NAS) to determine optimal task sequencing for Continual Learning.

Result: Experimental results indicate that intelligent task sequencing significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves robustness when combined with traditional strategies.

Conclusion: Optimal task sequencing not only enhances Continual Learning by mitigating forgetting but can also be employed in other domains like curriculum learning.

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

### [308] [Improving Low-Latency Learning Performance in Spiking Neural Networks via a Change-Perceptive Dendrite-Soma-Axon Neuron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16259)
*Zeyu Huang,Wei Meng,Quan Liu,Kun Chen,Li Ma*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CP-DSA neuron model with a soft reset and change-perceptive mechanism, overcoming issues in spiking neuron models and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and biological inaccuracies in traditional spiking neuron models by developing a more advanced mechanism for SNNs.

Method: Introduce the CP-DSA neuron model with a dendrite-soma-axon structure, a soft reset mechanism, and change-perceptive features, coupled with learnable parameters for improved neuron representation.

Result: CP-DSA neurons demonstrate competitive and superior performance in short time steps and perform better on various datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The CP-DSA model significantly improves SNN efficiency and simulation accuracy by addressing the limitations of traditional spiking neuron designs, validated through theoretical and experimental analysis.

Abstract: Spiking neurons, the fundamental information processing units of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), have the all-or-zero information output form that allows SNNs to be more energy-efficient compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the hard reset mechanism employed in spiking neurons leads to information degradation due to its uniform handling of diverse membrane potentials. Furthermore, the utilization of overly simplified neuron models that disregard the intricate biological structures inherently impedes the network's capacity to accurately simulate the actual potential transmission process. To address these issues, we propose a dendrite-soma-axon (DSA) neuron employing the soft reset strategy, in conjunction with a potential change-based perception mechanism, culminating in the change-perceptive dendrite-soma-axon (CP-DSA) neuron. Our model contains multiple learnable parameters that expand the representation space of neurons. The change-perceptive (CP) mechanism enables our model to achieve competitive performance in short time steps utilizing the difference information of adjacent time steps. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the CP-DSA model and the functional characteristics of its internal parameters. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on various datasets substantiate the significant advantages of the CP-DSA model over state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), neural systems capable of evolving themselves without external optimizers, demonstrating adaptability and emergent dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop neural networks capable of autonomous evolution and adaptability, mimicking biological systems and enabling open-ended learning.

Method: Self-Referential GHNs are based on hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, allowing for self-mutation, evaluation, and adaptive mutation rates.

Result: Self-Referential GHNs successfully adapted in reinforcement learning benchmarks under environmental shifts and demonstrated coherent gait evolution in a locomotion task.

Conclusion: Evolvability can emerge from neural self-reference, paving the way for systems that mirror biological evolution and enable autonomous learning.

Abstract: How can neural networks evolve themselves without relying on external optimizers? We propose Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks, systems where the very machinery of variation and inheritance is embedded within the network. By uniting hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, Self-Referential GHNs mutate and evaluate themselves while adapting mutation rates as selectable traits. Through new reinforcement learning benchmarks with environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), Self-Referential GHNs show swift, reliable adaptation and emergent population dynamics. In the locomotion benchmark Ant-v5, they evolve coherent gaits, showing promising fine-tuning capabilities by autonomously decreasing variation in the population to concentrate around promising solutions. Our findings support the idea that evolvability itself can emerge from neural self-reference. Self-Referential GHNs reflect a step toward synthetic systems that more closely mirror biological evolution, offering tools for autonomous, open-ended learning agents.

TL;DR: This paper explores the representational power of spiking neural networks (SNNs), demonstrating their efficiency in processing spike sequences and their ability to universally represent a class of spike train functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unique capabilities of spiking neural networks as energy-efficient alternatives to classical artificial neural networks and establish their universal representation properties.

Method: The authors analyze SNNs as sequence-to-sequence processors, constructively proving their universal representation property for spike train functions, and assess their efficiency in terms of neurons and weights required.

Result: SNNs are shown to be particularly effective for representing functions with fewer inputs, low temporal complexity, or composite functions, enabling efficient deep SNN design.

Conclusion: The study provides a quantitative and constructive basis for understanding SNN capabilities, particularly in spike train classification, reinforcing the potential of spike-based neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Inspired by biology, spiking neural networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes over time, offering an energy-efficient alternative to the classical computing paradigm and classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we analyze the representational power of SNNs by viewing them as sequence-to-sequence processors of spikes, i.e., systems that transform a stream of input spikes into a stream of output spikes. We establish the universal representation property for a natural class of spike train functions. Our results are fully quantitative, constructive, and near-optimal in the number of required weights and neurons. The analysis reveals that SNNs are particularly well-suited to represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. The latter is of particular interest, as it indicates that deep SNNs can efficiently capture composite functions via a modular design. As an application of our results, we discuss spike train classification. Overall, these results contribute to a rigorous foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of spike-based neuromorphic systems.

*Jalani Williams,Weina Wang,Mor Harchol-Balter*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of deterministic setup times on queueing in multiserver systems, deriving bounds for average waiting times using a novel technique (MIST).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the limitations of existing multiserver setups which rely on unrealistic exponential setup time assumptions and don't account for deterministic setup times that accurately model real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduces the Method of Intervening Stopping Times (MIST) for analyzing random time integrals and derives upper and lower bounds for waiting time in multiserver systems with deterministic setup times.

Result: Established the first closed-form bounds on average waiting times for finite-server systems with deterministic setup times, which are within a multiplicative constant of each other. Also developed an accurate approximation for waiting times.

Conclusion: The findings contribute a comprehensive framework for analyzing multiserver systems with deterministic setup times, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for performance optimization.

Abstract: In many systems, servers do not turn on instantly; instead, a setup time must pass before a server can begin work. These "setup times" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.
  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.
  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.

*Yijie Zhi,Yayu Cao,Jianhua Dai,Xiaoyang Han,Jingwen Pu,Qingran Wu,Sheng Cheng,Ming Cai*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LOOPRAG, a framework enhancing loop optimization using LLMs by integrating retrieval, feedback mechanisms, and equivalence checking, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize loop transformations with Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome limitations in effective and optimal code generation, addressing challenges such as errors and suboptimal solutions in loop optimization.

Method: Propose a retrieval-augmented generation framework (LOOPRAG) that includes parameter-driven loop property utilization, a loop-aware code retrieval algorithm for demonstration, and a feedback-based iterative mechanism for correct and efficient code generation.

Result: LOOPRAG achieves speedups over base compilers by up to 11.20× (PolyBench), 14.34× (TSVC), and 9.29× (LORE), and over base LLMs by up to 11.97×, 5.61×, and 11.59×, respectively.

Conclusion: LOOPRAG significantly enhances loop optimization capabilities of LLMs, outperforming conventional compilers and LLMs in code optimization benchmarks.

Abstract: Loop transformations are semantics-preserving optimization techniques, widely used to maximize objectives such as parallelism. Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives. Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization. However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4). The results demonstrate average speedups over base compilers of up to 11.20$\times$, 14.34$\times$, and 9.29$\times$ for PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE, respectively, and speedups over base LLMs of up to 11.97$\times$, 5.61$\times$, and 11.59$\times$.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper enhances NASA's FRET tool to handle probabilistic requirements, enabling automated translation of structured natural language into probabilistic temporal logic for analyzing adaptive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of specifying and analyzing probabilistic requirements in safety-critical systems without requiring developers to use complex mathematical notations.

Method: The authors extended NASA's FRET tool with structured natural language capabilities for probabilistic requirements and developed an automated approach to translate these into probabilistic temporal logic, validated through a formal proof and assurance framework.

Result: The enhanced FRET tool enables developers to specify probabilistic requirements in structured natural language, automatically translating them into formal logic for rigorous analysis.

Conclusion: This work facilitates formal analysis of uncertain and adaptive systems, reducing complexity and errors by bridging the gap between intuitive requirement specification and formal logic methods.

Abstract: Integrating autonomous and adaptive behavior into software-intensive systems presents significant challenges for software development, as uncertainties in the environment or decision-making processes must be explicitly captured. These challenges are amplified in safety- and mission-critical systems, which must undergo rigorous scrutiny during design and development. Key among these challenges is the difficulty of specifying requirements that use probabilistic constructs to capture the uncertainty affecting these systems. To enable formal analysis, such requirements must be expressed in precise mathematical notations such as probabilistic logics. However, expecting developers to write requirements directly in complex formalisms is unrealistic and highly error-prone. We extend the structured natural language used by NASA's Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) with support for the specification of unambiguous and correct probabilistic requirements, and develop an automated approach for translating these requirements into logical formulas. We propose and develop a formal, compositional, and automated approach for translating structured natural-language requirements into formulas in probabilistic temporal logic. To increase trust in our formalizations, we provide assurance that the generated formulas are well-formed and conform to the intended semantics through an automated validation framework and a formal proof. The extended FRET tool enables developers to specify probabilistic requirements in structured natural language, and to automatically translate them into probabilistic temporal logic, making the formal analysis of autonomous and adaptive systems more practical and less error-prone.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: NeuroInv integrates neural reasoning with symbolic verification to achieve a 99.5% success rate in loop invariant generation, which is critical for program verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of reliable methodologies in using LLMs for automated program verification and better integrate them with established program verification theories.

Method: NeuroInv combines neural reasoning using LLMs and Hoare logic for candidate invariant generation and refinement with a symbolic module that repairs invariants using counterexamples from OpenJML.

Result: NeuroInv achieved a 99.5% success rate on a benchmark of 150 Java programs and demonstrated scalability on a harder benchmark of multi-loop programs.

Conclusion: The NeuroInv approach demonstrates a significant improvement in loop invariant generation, bridging the gap between neural methods and symbolic program verification, and scaling effectively for complex cases.

Abstract: Loop invariant generation remains a critical bottleneck in automated program verification. Recent work has begun to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area, yet these approaches tend to lack a reliable and structured methodology, with little reference to existing program verification theory. This paper presents NeuroInv, a neurosymbolic approach to loop invariant generation. NeuroInv comprises two key modules: (1) a neural reasoning module that leverages LLMs and Hoare logic to derive and refine candidate invariants via backward-chaining weakest precondition reasoning, and (2) a verification-guided symbolic module that iteratively repairs invariants using counterexamples from OpenJML. We evaluate NeuroInv on a comprehensive benchmark of 150 Java programs, encompassing single and multiple (sequential) loops, multiple arrays, random branching, and noisy code segments. NeuroInv achieves a $99.5\%$ success rate, substantially outperforming the other evaluated approaches. Additionally, we introduce a hard benchmark of $10$ larger multi-loop programs (with an average of $7$ loops each); NeuroInv's performance in this setting demonstrates that it can scale to more complex verification scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimizations for language model inference performance by speculating tool calls and implementing a "tool cache" API, resulting in significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models are increasingly reliant on external tools for diverse functions, but these tools introduce performance bottlenecks during inference, necessitating solutions to enhance throughput and efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes speculative tool calls and a system that ensures sequences remain in the inference engine, alongside a theoretical analysis of configurations and the introduction of a "tool cache" API.

Result: The proposed optimizations significantly improve inference throughput by several hundred tokens per second.

Conclusion: The optimizations effectively address tool-related performance issues in language models, making them more efficient and practical for deployment.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly dependent on external tools. LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new "tool cache" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models for general-purpose robots transfer language and image inputs to action outputs, but videos provide spatio-temporal features naturally aligned with robotics. This novel paradigm explores video-based foundation models.

Method: They curated a large-scale, internet-based video dataset, trained a foundation-scale video model for generative robotics planning, and evaluated it via zero-shot video planning and physical execution experiments.

Result: The foundation model demonstrated successful task generalization and real-world robot execution via zero-shot video plans, showing robustness and feasibility.

Conclusion: Video-based training captures dynamics crucial for robotics and yields promising task and behavior generalization. Open releases aim to advance reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning. Our website is available at https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic simulators struggle with accurately and scalably modeling soft robots' complex behaviors, which include nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and difficult contact interactions.

Method: SORS uses a modular, energy-based finite element method framework, incorporating constrained nonlinear optimization to achieve physically accurate and stable contact modeling, with customizable material and actuation modules.

Result: The paper validates SORS through real-world experiments, including cantilever deflection, soft robotic arm actuation, and contact interactions, demonstrating high physical accuracy and utility for optimization tasks.

Conclusion: SORS is a versatile and extensible tool that bridges simulation-to-real-world gaps in soft robotics, aiding in the design and prototyping of next-gen soft robots with high fidelity and usability.

Abstract: The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant challenges spacecraft operators face in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), such as lighting dynamics, relative motion-induced variability, and self-shadowing, when visual inspections aim to extend satellite lifespan and improve maintenance strategies.

Method: The authors developed ΔLITE, a differentiable simulation pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to optimize orbital inspection trajectories for improved visual sensor data.

Result: The simulation enables the automatic design of inspection trajectories that maximize image quality by considering LEO-specific challenges. It offers significantly improved data utility compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ΔLITE is a pioneering tool in spacecraft mission planning, demonstrating the benefits of advanced computational and simulation tools for optimizing on-orbit inspection operations.

Abstract: Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting human perceptions of robot performance during social navigation tasks, with fewer labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional user studies and data-heavy machine learning methods in evaluating human-robot interactions and predicting human perceptions effectively.

Method: The authors extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with more navigation episodes and participant feedback. They then evaluate various LLMs using few-shot learning to predict human perceptions based on spatio-temporal robot and human motion cues.

Result: LLMs outperform traditional supervised models in predicting human perceptions with significantly fewer labeled data. Their prediction accuracy further improves with more in-context examples and personalized data.

Conclusion: Utilizing LLMs for few-shot learning in human-robot interactions is promising, scalable, and can enhance robot behavior with user-centered feedback.

Abstract: Understanding how humans evaluate robot behavior during human-robot interactions is crucial for developing socially aware robots that behave according to human expectations. While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of transporting payloads across uneven and unknown terrains while maintaining their desired orientation, which is crucial for stability and functionality in real-world applications.

Method: The authors use custom robots equipped with linear actuators and propose an open loop controller combined with a closed loop PID controller. This system monitors and adjusts actuator heights to retain the payload's orientation.

Result: The proposed system's efficacy was demonstrated in varied simulated environments that included complex and uneven terrains.

Conclusion: The system is robust and adaptable for payload transport on unknown and uneven terrains, proving its practicality and effectiveness in maintaining payload orientation using the novel control methodology.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi robot payload transport system to carry payloads through an environment of unknown and uneven inclinations while maintaining the desired orientation of the payload. For this task, we used custom built robots with a linear actuator (pistons) mounted on top of each robot. The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed controller by testing it on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains.

*Shuaidong Ji,Mahdi Bamdad,Francisco Cruz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents SWIFT-Nav, a UAV navigation framework that combines TD3-based policies with fuzzy logic for stable and obstacle-aware navigation in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments by creating a system that ensures stability, efficiency, and adaptability to such scenarios.

Method: The framework utilizes a perception module for obstacle sensing via LiDAR and confidence mapping, coupled with a TD3-trained waypoint policy with prioritized experience replay and epsilon-greedy exploration. Additionally, fuzzy logic is employed for safety scoring and mode control. Reward shaping is integrated to optimize task-aligned learning.

Result: SWIFT-Nav outperforms baseline methods in terms of trajectory smoothness, generalization to new layouts, and real-time responsiveness while ensuring stable obstacle-aware navigation.

Conclusion: Integrating TD3 with mechanisms like replay prioritization, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy safety results in a robust and deployable UAV navigation framework capable of handling cluttered environments effectively.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains challenging. We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness. These results show that combining TD3 with replay prioritisation, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy-safety rules yields a robust and deployable solution for UAV navigation in cluttered scenes.

*Maolin Lei,Edoardo Romiti,Arturo Laurenzi,Rui Dai,Matteo Dalle Vedove,Jiatao Ding,Daniele Fontanelli,Nikos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a computational framework for modular manipulators, optimizing morphology and motion under constraints, and introducing bi-branch designs for enhanced capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in modular manipulator deployment, including kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints, and to overcome torque limitations of single-branch designs with novel approaches.

Method: A unified task-driven framework with trajectory planning and co-optimization strategies, employing HMPC, CMA-ES for optimization, and introducing virtual module abstraction for bi-branch morphologies.

Result: Simulations and experiments validate the framework's effectiveness, showcasing its ability to generate feasible designs, customize objectives, and enable bi-branch morphologies for broader workspaces.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively designs and deploys modular manipulators, achieving both flexibility and efficiency across tasks while overcoming limitations of traditional designs.

Abstract: Modular manipulators composed of pre-manufactured and interchangeable modules offer high adaptability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.

Abstract: Simulation testing is a fundamental approach for evaluating automated vehicles (AVs). To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal.

Results show that it enhances the accuracy of interaction replication by 83.53% and boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across both vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics, with an improvement of 51.9%. Notably, the entire calibration process is fully automated, requiring no human intervention.

### [325] [ManiLong-Shot: Interaction-Aware One-Shot Imitation Learning for Long-Horizon Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16302)
*Zixuan Chen,Chongkai Gao,Lin Shao,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ManiLong-Shot is a novel framework for one-shot imitation learning (OSIL) that enables robots to handle long-horizon manipulation tasks by using interaction-aware primitives instead of continuous trajectories. It achieves superior results compared to existing methods in both simulations and real-robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OSIL methods are limited to short-horizon tasks, which restricts their scalability and practical application for more complex, long-horizon robotic manipulations. The work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: The proposed framework, ManiLong-Shot, decomposes long-horizon tasks into interaction-aware primitives guided by vision-language models or rule-based heuristics. It predicts critical task regions, matches correspondences between demonstration and observation, and calculates end-effector poses.

Result: ManiLong-Shot achieves a 22.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art methods in simulation tests with unseen tasks and demonstrates robustness in real-robot long-horizon manipulation experiments.

Conclusion: ManiLong-Shot successfully addresses the limitations of OSIL in short-horizon tasks, extending its applicability to complex scenarios and proving its effectiveness in both simulations and the real world.

Abstract: One-shot imitation learning (OSIL) offers a promising way to teach robots new skills without large-scale data collection. However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.

### [326] [A2VISR: An Active and Adaptive Ground-Aerial Localization System Using Visual Inertial and Single-Range Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16367)
*Sijia Chen,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ground-aerial localization system for flying robots utilizing active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow to enhance robustness in cluttered environments, achieving notable accuracy and resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flying robots often experience localization challenges in cluttered environments, especially under visual sensor degradation. Traditional methods relying on fixed cameras and pre-attached markers face constraints in distance and failure in capturing targets, necessitating robust solutions.

Method: The proposed system integrates active vision (with dynamically rotating cameras), single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow to detect and track infrared markers. It combines measurements using a dimension-reduced estimator with sliding window and adaptive confidence evaluation to balance efficiency and measurement quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the new system achieves robust localization even under challenging conditions like smoke, illumination changes, occlusions, and extended visual losses, with an average localization error of ~0.09 m.

Conclusion: The developed approach successfully enhances localization robustness for flying robots, maintaining resilience to sensor failures and visual degradations in real-world scenarios through innovative integration of diverse sensing and estimation techniques.

Abstract: It's a practical approach using the ground-aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.

*Enis Yalcin,Joshua O'Hara,Maria Stamatopoulou,Chengxu Zhou,Dimitrios Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: E-SDS integrates vision-language models with terrain sensor analysis for generating rewards in humanoid locomotion, enabling robust locomotion policies that outperform manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based methods in humanoid locomotion are blind to environmental perception, which limits their capability to navigate complex terrains.

Method: The E-SDS framework combines vision-language models with real-time terrain sensor analysis to generate reward functions, grounded by example videos, for training locomotion policies.

Result: E-SDS successfully enabled stair descent, reduced velocity tracking error by up to 82.6% across four terrains, and automated reward design in less than two hours.

Conclusion: E-SDS shows that integrating environmental perception with vision-language models enhances the robustness and efficiency of locomotion while significantly reducing manual effort.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating reward design in humanoid locomotion, which could eliminate the need for tedious manual engineering. However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.

*Abhishek Kashyap,Yuxuan Yang,Henrik Andreasson,Todor Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for 3D shape completion of household objects in cluttered scenes using diffusion models, enhancing robot grasping capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single camera views in vision-based robot manipulation only capture partial geometry, especially in cluttered scenarios, leading to reduced grasp estimation performance.

Method: The authors use diffusion models to achieve category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from single views.

Result: The approach improves grasp success rates in cluttered environments by 23% over a naive baseline and 19% over a state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates the effectiveness of using generative diffusion models for improved shape completion and robot grasping in realistic conditions.

Abstract: In vision-based robot manipulation, a single camera view can only capture one side of objects of interest, with additional occlusions in cluttered scenes further restricting visibility. As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

Result: MPBS demonstrates significant improvements in task completion efficiency and resource utilization, validated through experiments on the GeoLife dataset.

Conclusion: MPBS offers an adaptive, predictive, and behavior-aware solution for the efficient management of unmanned systems in collaborative settings.

Abstract: As unmanned systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) become increasingly important to applications like urban sensing and emergency response, efficiently recruiting these autonomous devices to perform time-sensitive tasks has become a critical challenge. This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of redundancy and heterogeneity in crowdsourced visual data, caused by overlapping perspectives, varying resolutions, and differing user behaviors.

Method: The proposed method, Tri-Select, filters data through (1) metadata-based filtering, (2) spectral clustering using spatial similarity, and (3) maximum independent set-based visual-feature selection.

Result: Experiments using real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select enhances both efficiency and quality of selected images, proving its effectiveness for scalable applications.

Conclusion: Tri-Select is a robust framework for scalable mobile visual crowdsensing, improving dataset quality and selection efficiency to facilitate fine-grained environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Mobile visual crowdsensing enables large-scale, fine-grained environmental monitoring through the collection of images from distributed mobile devices. However, the resulting data is often redundant and heterogeneous due to overlapping acquisition perspectives, varying resolutions, and diverse user behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Tri-Select, a multi-stage visual data selection framework that efficiently filters redundant and low-quality images. Tri-Select operates in three stages: (1) metadata-based filtering to discard irrelevant samples; (2) spatial similarity-based spectral clustering to organize candidate images; and (3) a visual-feature-guided selection based on maximum independent set search to retain high-quality, representative images. Experiments on real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select improves both selection efficiency and dataset quality, making it well-suited for scalable crowdsensing applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of coordinating multiple robots to build 3-D structures. This problem consists of a set of mobile robots that interact with each other in order to autonomously build a predefined 3-D structure. Our approach is based on Supervisory Control Theory, and it allows us to synthesize from models that represent a single robot and the target structure a correct-by-construction reactive controller, called supervisor. When this supervisor is replicated for the other robots, then the target structure can be completed by all robots

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper details the creation of a believable robotic version of the animated character Olaf using innovative mechanical design and reinforcement learning for stylized motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bring animated characters like Olaf into the physical world, requiring innovative solutions for mechanical design and control systems suited to non-standard proportions and movements.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning guided by animation references for motion control, incorporate hidden mechanical structures for non-standard movements, and introduce additional design considerations such as rewards to reduce noise and prevent actuators from overheating.

Result: The designed robot effectively mimics Olaf's movements with a high level of believability, validated both in simulation and with hardware testing.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the mechanical and control principles needed to create a convincing robotic version of animated characters, pushing the boundaries of costumed robotic character design.

Abstract: Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in extracting task-relevant features for 3D manipulation due to multi-camera redundancy and irrelevant information, leading to increased computational and training costs.

Method: The VERM method utilizes foundation models to generate virtual task-adaptive views from 3D point clouds, coupled with a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure.

Result: VERM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness, reducing training time by 1.89x and inference speed by 1.54x, supported by experimental results in simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: VERM demonstrates its capability to enhance 3D robotic manipulation tasks efficiently, offering speedup and accuracy improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks for autonomous driving, proposing classifications and summarizing challenges and directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional driving pipelines and Vision-Action (VA) models, integrating multimodal language for robustness and interpretability.

Method: Characterizes VLA frameworks into End-to-End and Dual-System paradigms, with further subclass distinctions and evaluations using benchmarks.

Result: The study organizes VLA landscapes, providing structured insights and challenges for future progression.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational understanding for developing human-compatible autonomous driving systems using VLA approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the viewpoint mismatch between human egocentric videos and third-person data used to train robots, aiming to enable efficient and practical robot training using structured egocentric data.

Method: Developed the Egocentric2Embodiment pipeline to convert human egocentric videos into structured VQA supervision grounded in evidence and temporal consistency, creating the E2E-3M dataset.

Result: PhysBrain model trained on E2E-3M demonstrated improved egocentric understanding, enhanced planning capabilities, and better performance in sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and robot control tasks (53.9% success rate).

Conclusion: The paper proves the feasibility of leveraging human egocentric videos for scalable and cost-effective robot training, achieving significant advancements in physical intelligence and downstream control efficiency.

Abstract: Robotic generalization relies on physical intelligence: the ability to reason about state changes, contact-rich interactions, and long-horizon planning under egocentric perception and action. However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.

Abstract: Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase. More results and videos available in https://reinforcegen.github.io/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolaRiS, a framework for realistic robot policy evaluation using video-based scene reconstruction for reliable and efficient simulation benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking robot policies is challenging due to variability, reproducibility, and real-world testing limitations, especially for generalist policies.

Method: They present PolaRiS, utilizing neural reconstruction of real-world video scans to create high-fidelity simulations, alongside simulation data co-training for improving real-to-sim evaluations.

Result: PolaRiS showed stronger correlation with real-world robot performance compared to existing simulation benchmarks and simplified the creation of diverse simulation environments.

Conclusion: PolaRiS is a step forward towards scalable and accessible robotic policy evaluation frameworks, benefiting research in robotic foundation models.

Abstract: A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of vision language models (VLMs) to detect cross-browser inconsistencies (XBIs) through the XBIDetective tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of identifying browser rendering bugs triggered by specific conditions, and to improve the detection of XBIs, especially in dynamic and interactive website elements.

Method: The authors developed XBIDetective, a tool that captures and analyzes screenshots of websites rendered in Firefox and Chrome using both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned VLMs.

Result: XBIDetective demonstrated an accuracy of 79% in identifying XBIs, and further achieved 84% and 85% accuracy in detecting dynamic elements and advertisements, respectively, using the fine-tuned VLM.

Conclusion: XBIDetective is effective for identifying cross-browser discrepancies and offers potential use cases like automated testing and large-scale website monitoring.

Abstract: Browser rendering bugs can be challenging to detect for browser developers, as they may be triggered by very specific conditions that are exhibited on only a very small subset of websites. Cross-browser inconsistencies (XBIs), variations in how a website is interpreted and displayed on different browsers, can be helpful guides to detect such rendering bugs. Although visual and Document Object Model (DOM)-based analysis techniques exist for detecting XBIs, they often struggle with dynamic and interactive elements. In this study, we discuss our industry experience with using vision language models (VLMs) to identify XBIs. We present the XBIDetective tool which automatically captures screenshots of a website in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, and analyzes them with a VLM for XBIs. We evaluate XBIDetective's performance with an off-the-shelf and a fine-tuned VLM on 1,052 websites. We show that XBIDetective can identify cross-browser discrepancies with 79% accuracy and detect dynamic elements and advertisements with 84% and 85% accuracy, respectively, when using the fine-tuned VLM. We discuss important lessons learned, and we present several potential practical use cases for XBIDetective, including automated regression testing, large-scale monitoring of websites, and rapid triaging of XBI bug reports.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMem introduces an architecture for implementing procedural memory using code, ensuring deterministic reliability for repetitive AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of tool-using AI agents in terms of action space, context inefficiency, and probabilistic instability, particularly for repetitive tasks.

Method: Utilizes procedural memory implemented through code to enable deterministic and reusable agentic workflows.

Result: CodeMem provides consistent and reliable task execution, solving probabilistic instability issues in previous AI frameworks.

Conclusion: CodeMem offers a solution to improve the reliability and efficiency of repetitive AI-driven tasks by leveraging procedural memory and reusable workflows.

Abstract: Current tool-using AI agents suffer from limited action space, context inefficiency, and probabilistic instability that makes them unsuitable for handling repetitive tasks which are otherwise reliably and efficiently tackled by agentic workflows built on platforms like n8n and Zapier. Earlier works like CodeAct, DynaSaur, Code Mode have tried to tackle the first two issues by using the whole Python language as its action space: The number of tools that the agent can call becomes infinite. Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability. This paper proposes CodeMem, an architecture to implement procedural memory via code which can be used to build and run reusable agentic workflows with deterministic reliability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (OLAF) to enhance reliability and transparency of Large Language Models (LLMs) used for empirical software engineering annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used to automate annotations in empirical software engineering, but their reliability and reproducibility are underexplored and often lack standardized measures.

Method: A conceptual framework is proposed to structure constructs like reliability, calibration, drift, consensus, aggregation, and transparency.

Result: The framework provides a systematic way to assess and improve LLM-based annotation processes.

Conclusion: Studying LLM-based annotation methods systematically can lead to more reliable, transparent, and reproducible empirical software engineering research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in empirical software engineering (ESE) to automate or assist annotation tasks such as labeling commits, issues, and qualitative artifacts. Yet the reliability and reproducibility of such annotations remain underexplored. Existing studies often lack standardized measures for reliability, calibration, and drift, and frequently omit essential configuration details. We argue that LLM-based annotation should be treated as a measurement process rather than a purely automated activity. In this position paper, we outline the \textbf{Operationalization for LLM-based Annotation Framework (OLAF)}, a conceptual framework that organizes key constructs: \textit{reliability, calibration, drift, consensus, aggregation}, and \textit{transparency}. The paper aims to motivate methodological discussion and future empirical work toward more transparent and reproducible LLM-based annotation in software engineering research.

*Yirui He,Yuqi Huai,Xingyu Chen,Joshua Garcia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ClassLAR is a new approach for recovering Java modules from monolithic systems, outperforming current methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modularizing monolithic Java projects, as existing architectural recovery techniques fail to effectively recover JPMS modules.

Method: Introduced ClassLAR, a lightweight method utilizing fully-qualified class names and leveraging language models to extract semantic information for modular architectural recovery.

Result: ClassLAR outperformed state-of-the-art architectural recovery techniques in similarity metrics and was 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.

Conclusion: ClassLAR is an efficient and accurate solution for modularizing Java systems and aligning them with JPMS requirements.

Abstract: As an increasing number of software systems reach unprecedented scale, relying solely on code-level abstractions is becoming impractical. While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent. In evaluations across 20 popular Java projects, ClassLAR outperformed all state-of-the-art techniques in architectural-level similarity metrics while achieving execution times that were 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.

*Xin Wang,Zhenhao Li,Zishuo Ding*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) as samplers for multi-objective performance modeling, showing their effectiveness in surpassing traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether LLMs can improve sampling strategies for performance models in complex software configurations and multi-objective optimization.

Method: The authors designed LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework to evaluate LLM-guided sampling across various real-world systems, comparing its performance to traditional baselines.

Result: LLM4Perf proved superior in 68.8% of evaluation scenarios and enhanced baseline methods in 91.5% of cases due to configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMs are highly effective in performance engineering, supported by insights into their mechanisms.

Abstract: The performance of modern software systems is critically dependent on their complex configuration options. Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes 42 studies on Apache Kafka from 2015-2025, identifies nine design patterns, and emphasizes inconsistencies in benchmarking. It proposes a unified taxonomy for improved reproducibility and system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation in research regarding reusable design patterns and benchmarking methodologies for Apache Kafka, despite its widespread use and maturity.

Method: Reviewed 42 publications, identified recurring design patterns, and examined trends, deployments, and benchmarking practices, while identifying inconsistencies.

Result: Identified nine Kafka design patterns like log compaction and event sourcing replay; outlined inconsistencies in configuration disclosure and reproducibility in the studies.

Conclusion: This study offers a taxonomy, benchmark matrix, and decision heuristics to enable better system design and reproducibility for Kafka-based systems.

Abstract: Apache Kafka has become a foundational platform for high throughput event streaming, enabling real time analytics, financial transaction processing, industrial telemetry, and large scale data driven systems. Despite its maturity and widespread adoption, consolidated research on reusable architectural design patterns and reproducible benchmarking methodologies remains fragmented across academic and industrial publications. This paper presents a structured synthesis of forty two peer reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025, identifying nine recurring Kafka design patterns including log compaction, CQRS bus, exactly once pipelines, change data capture, stream table joins, saga orchestration, tiered storage, multi tenant topics, and event sourcing replay. The analysis examines co usage trends, domain specific deployments, and empirical benchmarking practices using standard suites such as TPCx Kafka and the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, as well as custom workloads. The study highlights significant inconsistencies in configuration disclosure, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility that limit cross study comparison and practical replication. By providing a unified taxonomy, pattern benchmark matrix, and actionable decision heuristics, this work offers practical guidance for architects and researchers designing reproducible, high performance, and fault tolerant Kafka based event streaming systems.

*Ora Nova Fandina,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Raviv Gal,Wesam Ibraheem,Rami Katan,Alice Podolsky*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of Large Language Models as judges (LaaJ) in evaluating code generation, specifically for COBOL legacy code modernization. A hybrid approach using an analytic checker improves error detection and explanatory depth significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LaaJ) in accurately assessing domain-specific errors, which is critical in high-stakes industrial applications like COBOL code generation.

Method: The authors identify blind spots in LaaJ through expert analysis and construct a taxonomy of domain issues. They develop an analytic checker tool to flag these issues and dynamically inject analytical hints into LaaJ prompts to improve error detection and evaluation.

Result: Experiments reveal that standalone LaaJ detects only 45% of errors, but combining LaaJ with hints from the analytic checker increases detection coverage to 94%, offering deeper and more accurate explanations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining analytic tools with LaaJ significantly enhances the reliability and depth of error evaluations, making it a more effective solution for domain-specific tasks like legacy code modernization.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as judges (LaaJ) in code generation pipelines. While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.
  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.
  Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines. We release the dataset and all used prompts.

*Yibiao Yang,Qingyang Li,Maolin Sun,Jiangchang Wu,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study compares the effectiveness of common bug-inducing commit (BIC)-based strategies to Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques for compiler fault localization, showing the practicality of the BIC-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faults in compilers have serious ramifications, and developers commonly rely on examining version histories to fix bugs. The effectiveness of BIC-based strategies versus SBFL methods has not been tested extensively.

Method: The researchers utilized a BIC-based strategy, Basic, and compared it with SBFL techniques on a dataset of GCC and LLVM compiler bugs using binary search and file modification analysis.

Result: Basic exhibited performance comparable to or better than SBFL-based techniques, especially for Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics, indicating its practical relevance.

Conclusion: Future research should use the Basic strategy as a baseline for developing compiler fault isolation methods, due to its proven effectiveness.

Abstract: Background: Compilers are fundamental to software development, translating high-level source code into executable software systems. Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios. We recommend that future research adopt Basic as a baseline when developing and evaluating new compiler fault isolation methods.

### [347] [An Empirical Study of the Realism of Mutants in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16741)
*Zaheed Ahmed,Philip Makedonski,Jens Grabowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study empirically compares pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in deep learning (DL) for their realism in replicating real faults. Pre-training mutants showed greater similarity to real faults but at higher computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to validate the assumption that mutants in DL systems behave similarly to real faults, as this assumption is yet unverified for DL applications despite being established in traditional software systems.

Method: A statistical framework is proposed to measure coupling strength and behavioral similarity of mutants to real faults using four publicly available bug datasets. Mutants are created with advanced tools for pre-training and post-training techniques.

Result: Pre-training mutants demonstrate stronger coupling and behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, proving their greater realism. However, pre-training methods incur significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved post-training mutation operators that can achieve the realism of pre-training mutants but with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Mutation analysis is a well-established technique for assessing test quality in the traditional software development paradigm by injecting artificial faults into programs. Its application to deep learning (DL) has expanded beyond classical testing to support tasks such as fault localization, repair, data generation, and model robustness evaluation. The core assumption is that mutants behave similarly to real faults, an assumption well established in traditional software systems but largely unverified for DL.
  This study presents the first empirical comparison of pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in DL with respect to realism. We introduce a statistical framework to quantify their coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults using publicly available bugs datasets: CleanML, DeepFD, DeepLocalize, and defect4ML. Mutants are generated using state-of-the-art tools representing both approaches.
  Results show that pre-training mutants exhibit consistently stronger coupling and higher behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, indicating greater realism. However, the substantial computational cost of pre-training mutation underscores the need for more effective post-training operators that match or exceed the realism demonstrated by pre-training mutants.

*Aaron Imani,Mohammad Moshirpour,Iftekhar Ahmed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies the role of comments in Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering tasks using internal concept representations and highlights their significant, task-dependent impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand where in LLMs the reliance on source code comments resides and how this reliance affects performance during software engineering tasks.

Method: The study employs Concept Activation Vectors (CAV) to analyze internal comment representation across three tasks (code completion, translation, and refinement), activating and deactivating concepts to study their impact. It also conducts controlled experiments across 10 distinct tasks to measure comment concept activation.

Result: The study found that LLMs recognize comments as distinct concepts, with task-specific impacts on model performance varying between -90% and +67%. Code summarization triggers the strongest comment activation, while code completion shows the weakest sensitivity.

Conclusion: Understanding internal comment representations helps improve SE tools and models by moving beyond surface-level input, fostering tools that manipulate internal concepts for enhanced performance.

Abstract: While comments are non-functional elements of source code, Large Language Models (LLM) frequently rely on them to perform Software Engineering (SE) tasks. Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity. These results open a new direction for building SE tools and models that reason about and manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on surface-level input.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, CAFFE, for testing counterfactual fairness in large language models to enhance fairness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address fairness concerns in large language models, as these models increasingly influence modern software systems, and existing methods for detecting fairness issues are limited.

Method: The CAFFE framework formalizes fairness testing by defining explicit test components (e.g., prompt intent, input variants), automates the generation of test data, and evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics.

Result: Experiments show that CAFFE provides broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior compared to existing metamorphic testing approaches.

Conclusion: CAFFE offers an intent-aware and structured approach to assess counterfactual fairness in LLMs, demonstrating improved fairness detection capabilities.

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational components of modern software systems. As their influence grows, concerns about fairness have become increasingly pressing. Prior work has proposed metamorphic testing to detect fairness issues, applying input transformations to uncover inconsistencies in model behavior. This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfactual fairness in LLMs, proposing a structured and intent-aware framework coined CAFFE (Counterfactual Assessment Framework for Fairness Evaluation). Inspired by traditional non-functional testing, CAFFE (1) formalizes LLM-Fairness test cases through explicitly defined components, including prompt intent, conversational context, input variants, expected fairness thresholds, and test environment configuration, (2) assists testers by automatically generating targeted test data, and (3) evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics. Our experiments, conducted on three different architectural families of LLM, demonstrate that CAFFE achieves broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing metamorphic approaches.

### [350] [Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15891)
*Terrence J. Sejnowski*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how spike timing in cortical neurons, regulated by traveling waves and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), could explain long-term working memory and cognitive networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate mechanisms that regulate spike timing and STDP in vivo, and their potential role in creating a cognitive network for long-term working memory.

Method: Examines the temporal precision of spiking in cortical neurons, introduces the role of traveling waves, and analyzes their connection to STDP for long-term memory.

Result: Proposes that traveling waves and STDP together enable the creation of a temporary network, plausibly responsible for supporting long-term working memory.

Conclusion: Although neither traveling waves nor STDP alone has explained cortical function, their integration may underlie higher cognitive processes like long-term working memory.

Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).

Method: They propose a thought experiment, imagining being a neuron interacting with others, to explore the nature of information processing and time in the brain.

Result: The thought experiment questions traditional divides, such as ecological psychology versus neurosciences, and emphasizes recurrent external interactions in information processing.

Conclusion: This discussion bridges frameworks focusing on internal versus external elements of the brain, potentially redirecting theoretical perspectives or experimental neuroscience. It ties to classic philosophical thought experiments.

Abstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network of cells, mostly neurons. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest echo to fruitful thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator, or the cogito.

### [352] [Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12767)
*Thiparat Chotibut,Oleg Evnin,Weerawit Horinouchi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores how trained recurrent networks with excitatory and inhibitory units exhibit properties like sparse Jacobian matrices with diverse timescales, enabling robust working memory performance by investigating spectral dynamics using an analytic statistical field theory approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the link between trained neural network characteristics and their role in shaping dynamical landscapes crucial for robust working memory tasks.

Method: Analyzed Jacobian matrices from trained networks, developed a random matrix ensemble to represent these characteristics, and applied statistical field theory and supersymmetry techniques to study the spectrum and dynamics near equilibria.

Result: The research provides an analytic description of spectral properties, connecting statistical features of Jacobians to near-critical equilibria that enable robust working memory computation.

Conclusion: Trained excitatory/inhibitory networks exhibit dynamics governed by spectral properties emerging from structured synaptic and timescale heterogeneity, enabling enhanced task performance and indicating general frameworks for neural computation.

Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.

### [353] [BayesSum: Bayesian Quadrature in Discrete Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16105)
*Sophia Seulkee Kang,François-Xavier Briol,Toni Karvonen,Zonghao Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'BayesSum,' a novel estimation method for discrete domains using Bayesian quadrature, achieving higher sample efficiency and faster convergence than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Monte Carlo require large sample sizes for accuracy in discrete domain expectations; a more sample-efficient technique is needed.

Method: The authors propose 'BayesSum,' which uses a Gaussian process in Bayesian quadrature to leverage prior knowledge of the integrand and ensure faster convergence.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that BayesSum converges faster than Monte Carlo estimators in several scenarios, including synthetic settings and real-world parameter estimation tasks.

Conclusion: BayesSum is an efficient alternative to traditional estimators, excelling in computational tasks over discrete domains with fewer samples required for accuracy.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging computational problem of estimating intractable expectations over discrete domains. Existing approaches, including Monte Carlo and Russian Roulette estimators, are consistent but often require a large number of samples to achieve accurate results. We propose a novel estimator, \emph{BayesSum}, which is an extension of Bayesian quadrature to discrete domains. It is more sample efficient than alternatives due to its ability to make use of prior information about the integrand through a Gaussian process. We show this through theory, deriving a convergence rate significantly faster than Monte Carlo in a broad range of settings. We also demonstrate empirically that our proposed method does indeed require fewer samples on several synthetic settings as well as for parameter estimation for Conway-Maxwell-Poisson and Potts models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the problem of network structure learning from zero-inflated count data, which poses challenges in accurately modeling and learning directed acyclic graph structures.

Method: The authors propose ZICO, leveraging zero-inflated generalized linear models with a smooth score-based objective function, acyclicity enforcement via differentiable constraints, and sparsity regularization.

Result: ZICO demonstrates faster runtimes and better accuracy on simulated data, and performs as well or better than existing methods for reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

Conclusion: ZICO is an efficient, scalable solution for network structure learning from zero-inflated data, offering practical runtime advantages and broader applicability.

Abstract: We address network structure learning from zero-inflated count data by casting each node as a zero-inflated generalized linear model and optimizing a smooth, score-based objective under a directed acyclic graph constraint. Our Zero-Inflated Continuous Optimization (ZICO) approach uses node-wise likelihoods with canonical links and enforces acyclicity through a differentiable surrogate constraint combined with sparsity regularization. ZICO achieves superior performance with faster runtimes on simulated data. It also performs comparably to or better than common algorithms for reverse engineering gene regulatory networks. ZICO is fully vectorized and mini-batched, enabling learning on larger variable sets with practical runtimes in a wide range of domains.

*Seyda Betul Aydin,Holger Brandt*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation using transfer learning (TL-TARNet) for small sample contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of generalizing causal knowledge, specifically in small datasets where external validity and precise ITE estimation are difficult.

Method: The authors employ TL-TARNet, a transfer learning method based on TARNet, and test it in simulations and real-world datasets, like the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II).

Result: TL-TARNet reduces ITE error and bias in small sample settings when leveraging a large, unbiased source dataset.

Conclusion: Transfer learning enhances causal model performance in estimating ITE for small datasets, showcasing potential applications in domains like behavioral sciences.

Abstract: Generalizing causal knowledge across diverse environments is challenging, especially when estimates from large-scale datasets must be applied to smaller or systematically different contexts, where external validity is critical. Model-based estimators of individual treatment effects (ITE) from machine learning require large sample sizes, limiting their applicability in domains such as behavioral sciences with smaller datasets. We demonstrate how estimation of ITEs with Treatment Agnostic Representation Networks (TARNet; Shalit et al., 2017) can be improved by leveraging knowledge from source datasets and adapting it to new settings via transfer learning (TL-TARNet; Aloui et al., 2023). In simulations that vary source and sample sizes and consider both randomized and non-randomized intervention target settings, the transfer-learning extension TL-TARNet improves upon standard TARNet, reducing ITE error and attenuating bias when a large unbiased source is available and target samples are small. In an empirical application using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), we estimate the effect of mothers' firewood collection time on children's weekly study time; transfer learning pulls the target mean ITEs toward the source ITE estimate, reducing bias in the estimates obtained without transfer. These results suggest that transfer learning for causal models can improve the estimation of ITE in small samples.

TL;DR: This paper presents a generative model framework that efficiently produces equilibrium configurations for amorphous materials, addressing symmetry and geometric constraints to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials in amorphous systems is a challenging and slow task due to their lack of atomic periodicity and disorder.

Method: The authors utilize an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework that combines a Riemannian stochastic interpolant with equivariant flow matching, incorporating symmetries and periodic boundary conditions using an equivariant graph neural network on a torus.

Result: Numerical experiments show significant improvement in generative performance when symmetry and geometric constraints are enforced.

Conclusion: This novel method successfully addresses challenges in generating equilibrium configurations for amorphous materials, leveraging advanced mathematical and symmetry-based techniques to overcome traditional bottlenecks.

Abstract: Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.

*Soon Hoe Lim*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the biases of empirical flow matching (FM) samplers, revealing that they are energetically suboptimal and dependent on source distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the biases and energetic suboptimalities in empirical flow matching (FM) samplers, as they deviate from optimal transport (OT) behaviors.

Method: The authors analyze empirical FM with mathematical tools, focusing on the kinetic energy of generated samples from various source distributions (Gaussian and heavy-tailed).

Result: Empirical FM minimizers are shown to not be gradient fields and result in energetic inefficiencies. Kinetic energy behaviors depend on the source distribution rather than data.

Conclusion: Empirical FM introduces intrinsic structural and energetic biases, with outcomes largely governed by the source distribution choice.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is almost never a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically energetically suboptimal. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Foundation models in AI are promising in biomedical imaging but face challenges in clinical application. The focus should shift to causal reasoning and trustworthy deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the current capabilities and limitations of foundation models in biomedical imaging and explore pathways to more ethical and robust deployment.

Method: Analyzing current state-of-the-art foundation models, creating a taxonomy of reasoning, and examining key deployment challenges such as bias, trustworthiness, and validation frameworks.

Result: Foundation models demonstrate significant potential but lack causal inference and robustness for clinical deployment due to issues like bias, hallucinations, and inadequate validation processes.

Conclusion: While foundation models can augment clinical practice, their safe and effective integration requires progress in causal understanding, safety verification, and ethical deployment frameworks.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are driving a prominent shift in artificial intelligence across different domains, including biomedical imaging. These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper presents StructBioReasoner, a multi-agent system for designing biologics targeting intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), improving therapeutic applications in challenging disease contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins are critical in disease progression, yet lack stable structures, making them difficult to target with therapeutics. A scalable system is needed for computationally exploring the massive conformational space and leveraging high-affinity binders effectively.

Method: StructBioReasoner uses a tournament-based framework where specialized agents compete to refine therapeutic hypotheses. The system integrates diverse computational tools, utilizes HPC resources, and employs an agentic middleware to scale operations.

Result: Benchmarking the system on Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 proteins showed over 50% of designed binders surpass human references for Der f 21, and identified notable binding modes for NMNAT-2 including the NMNAT2:p53 interface.

Conclusion: StructBioReasoner provides a novel platform for Exascale-based therapeutic discovery of IDP binders, demonstrating efficiency and potential for addressing previously untargetable diseases.

Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent crucial therapeutic targets due to their significant role in disease -- approximately 80\% of cancer-related proteins contain long disordered regions -- but their lack of stable secondary/tertiary structures makes them "undruggable". While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at scale.To address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy. We benchmark StructBioReasoner across Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 and demonstrate that over 50\% of 787 designed and validated candidates for Der f 21 outperformed the human-designed reference binders from literature, in terms of improved binding free energy. For the more challenging NMNAT-2 protein, we identified three binding modes from 97,066 binders, including the well-studied NMNAT2:p53 interface. Thus, StructBioReasoner lays the groundwork for agentic reasoning systems for IDP therapeutic discovery on Exascale platforms.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using week-long intracranial and audio recordings to improve speech decoding models from brain activity, outperforming traditional methods and addressing cross-day variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to overcome the limitations of speech decoding studies, which typically use small, controlled datasets, by leveraging larger and long-term neural recordings for training.

Method: The authors use week-long intracranial and audio recordings coupled with a contrastive learning model for pretraining, enabling better scalability and performance based on dataset size.

Result: The pretrained model outperforms those trained on traditional datasets, with performance gains scaling log-linearly as dataset size increases. The models also expose global structure variability in brain activity across days.

Conclusion: This work shows the potential for scalable and improved decoding of brain representations of speech in both real-life and controlled settings, while emphasizing a need to address variability across days in future models.

Abstract: Decoding speech from brain activity has typically relied on limited neural recordings collected during short and highly controlled experiments. Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cepstrum-based pitch modification method compatible with mel-based vocoders, requiring no additional training or model alteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a universal pitch modification method that works seamlessly with any mel-based vocoder, enhancing flexibility without retraining models.

Method: A cepstrum-based approach modifies mel-spectrograms by using pseudo-inversion, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and mel-filterbanks to shift harmonic structures as desired.

Result: Experimental validation shows compatibility with state-of-the-art vocoders, surpassing traditional pitch modification methods based on objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates effective, universal pitch modification capabilities in mel-spectrogram features, bridging limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cepstrum-based pitch modification method that can be applied to any mel-spectrogram representation. As a result, this method is compatible with any mel-based vocoder without requiring any additional training or changes to the model. This is achieved by directly modifying the cepstrum feature space in order to shift the harmonic structure to the desired target. The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank. These pitch-shifted mel-spectrogram features can be converted to speech with any compatible vocoder. The proposed method is validated experimentally with objective and subjective metrics on various state-of-the-art neural vocoders as well as in comparison with traditional pitch modification methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents DACH-TIC, a new model for robust infant cry classification using causal-aware hierarchical audio transformers, achieving superior accuracy, macro-F1 scores, and domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts in acoustic analysis for neonatal distress detection, ensuring classification methods are accurate and interpretable.

Method: The proposed DACH-TIC model employs causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, adversarial domain generalization, and a structured transformer backbone.

Result: DACH-TIC achieved a 2.6% accuracy improvement and 2.2-point macro-F1 score improvement over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong performance in novel acoustic environments.

Conclusion: DACH-TIC proves effective for real-world neonatal monitoring systems, providing noise-robust and domain-agnostic acoustic analysis for infant cry classification and distress detection.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of infant cry paralinguistics is essential for early detection of neonatal distress and clinical decision support. However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework.
  DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation.
  Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity. The model generalizes effectively to unseen acoustic environments, with a domain performance gap of only 2.4 percent, demonstrating its suitability for real-world neonatal acoustic monitoring systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to establish a mathematical foundation for approximating complex stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion and solutions to stochastic differential equations, using tools from rough path theory and signature analysis.

Method: The approach involves deriving global $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems for weighted rough path spaces and proving the density of linear functionals on path signatures with respect to an $L^p$-distance.

Result: The paper successfully applies these theorems to Brownian motion, showing that linear functionals on the time-extended Brownian motion's signatures can approximate any $p$-integrable stochastic process adapted to the Brownian filtration.

Conclusion: The findings provide a robust mathematical framework for approximating adapted stochastic processes, further bridging rough path theory, stochastic calculus, and signature analysis.

Abstract: We establish $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems for general and non-anticipative functionals on suitable rough path spaces, showing that linear functionals acting on signatures of time-extended rough paths are dense with respect to an $L^p$-distance. To that end, we derive global universal approximation theorems for weighted rough path spaces. We demonstrate that these $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems apply in particular to Brownian motion. As a consequence, linear functionals on the signature of the time-extended Brownian motion can approximate any $p$-integrable stochastic process adapted to the Brownian filtration, including solutions to stochastic differential equations.

Result: Implementation demonstrates improved retrieval precision and advanced reasoning capabilities utilizing refined subgraphs through attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed model contributes an effective solution for processing and reasoning over large-scale scientific databases by leveraging advancements in GNNs and language models.

Abstract: In today's information-driven world, access to scientific publications has become increasingly easy. At the same time, filtering through the massive volume of available research has become more challenging than ever. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms have shown strong effectiveness in searching large-scale information databases, particularly when combined with modern large language models. In this paper, we propose an Attention-Based Subgraph Retriever, a GNN-as-retriever model that applies attention-based pruning to extract a refined subgraph, which is then passed to a large language model for advanced knowledge reasoning.

### [368] [Checking the HAL Interface Specification Continuously, Right from the Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16897)
*Manuel Bentele,Onur Altinordu,Jan Körner,Andreas Podelski,Axel Sikora*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to continuously check Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) specifications during the development of embedded applications to mitigate interface misuse and ensure smooth software model checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The correct use of HAL interfaces is essential to prevent issues like crashes or hardware damage, but the applicability of software model checking in industry is hindered by its unpredictability. This motivates finding an approach that integrates checking from the early stages of development.

Method: The paper introduces an iterative development process where the HAL interface is checked in each iteration. The approach starts with a basic program skeleton and then incrementally adds functionality while verifying compliance with the HAL interface specifications using software model checking.

Result: A preliminary evaluation shows that this method allows the software model checker to succeed consistently across development steps, including the final embedded application.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical and reliable solution to ensure HAL interface compliance in the iterative development of embedded systems, boosting the applicability of software model checking in industry.

Abstract: The correct use of a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface in embedded applications is crucial to prevent malfunctions, crashes, or even hardware damage. Software model checking has been successfully applied to check interface specifications in application programs, but its employment in industrial practice is hindered by its unpredictability (whether it succeeds for a given application program or not). In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this problem by checking the HAL interface specification continuously and right from the start of the development. I.e., we develop an embedded application in several iterations without a formal connection between the steps. The steps start from a program skeleton which does nothing but calling HAL functions. Actual functionality is added consecutively. The HAL interface specification is checked in each step of the sequence. The idea of the approach is to exploit a specific feature of software model checking: Its attempt to compute exactly the abstraction that is needed for the check to succeed may carry over from one step to the next, even if there is no formal connection between the steps. The experience from a preliminary experimental evaluation of our approach in the development of embedded applications is very promising. Following our approach, the check succeeds in each step and in particular in the final application program.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of discovering molecular structures in chemical analysis by harnessing the computational power of ASP to manage the exponential search space in this combinatorial problem.

### [370] [Bayesian Modeling for Uncertainty Management in Financial Risk Forecasting and Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15739)
*Sharif Al Mamun,Rakib Hossain,Md. Jobayer Rahman,Malay Kumar Devnath,Farhana Afroz,Lisan Al Amin*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: This paper presents a Bayesian analytics framework for financial risk management, showcasing methods such as forecasting market volatility, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. It emphasizes uncertainty quantification and model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve financial risk management by providing accurate models for risk forecasting, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring, with emphasis on uncertainty quantification and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose interpretable probabilistic models, including a discount-factor DLM model, Bayesian logistic regression, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model. These approaches utilize a GPU-accelerated pipeline to optimize forecasting, fraud detection, and compliance analysis.

Result: Their modeling yields improved performance in 95% Value-at-Risk forecasts, better recall and AUC-ROC in fraud detection, and adaptive compliance assessments. LSTM performs well in calibration tests, outperforming GARCH(1,1), while the proposed DLM shows some limitations.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant advancement in leveraging Bayesian methods for risk analytics, with future work aiming to address current challenges like sparse fraud data and scalability issues, while further improving feature sets and priors.

Abstract: A Bayesian analytics framework that precisely quantifies uncertainty offers a significant advance for financial risk management. We develop an integrated approach that consistently enhances the handling of risk in market volatility forecasting, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. Our probabilistic, interpretable models deliver reliable results: We evaluate the performance of one-day-ahead 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts on daily S&P 500 returns, with a training period from 2000 to 2019 and an out-of-sample test period spanning 2020 to 2024. Formal tests of unconditional (Kupiec) and conditional (Christoffersen) coverage reveal that an LSTM baseline achieves near-nominal calibration. In contrast, a GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations underestimates tail risk. Our proposed discount-factor DLM model produces a slightly liberal VaR estimate, with evidence of clustered violations. Bayesian logistic regression improves recall and AUC-ROC for fraud detection, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model provides transparent and adaptive compliance risk assessment. The pipeline is distinguished by precise uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and GPU-accelerated analysis, delivering up to 50x speedup. Remaining challenges include sparse fraud data and proxy compliance labels, but the framework enables actionable risk insights. Future expansion will extend feature sets, explore regime-switching priors, and enhance scalable inference.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a topological method to optimize the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using minimum spanning tree (MST) divergence analysis and improves heuristic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSP heuristics like 2-opt and 3-opt can be improved further, motivating the exploration of topology-based optimization.

Method: The canonical decomposition theorem is used to link the tour-MST gap with topology divergences, and topology-guided optimization is applied.

Result: Experiments show improved heuristic performance and faster optimization convergence across various instances of TSP.

Conclusion: Topology-based guidance enhances TSP solutions, promising faster and better optimization for heuristic methods.

Abstract: We introduce a topological feedback mechanism for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) by analyzing the divergence between a tour and the minimum spanning tree (MST). Our key contribution is a canonical decomposition theorem that expresses the tour-MST gap as edge-wise topology-divergence gaps from the RTD-Lite barcode. Based on this, we develop a topological guidance for 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics that increases their performance. We carry out experiments with fine-optimization of tours obtained from heatmap-based methods, TSPLIB, and random instances. Experiments demonstrate the topology-guided optimization results in better performance and faster convergence in many cases.

### [372] [Hierarchical Neural Surfaces for 3D Mesh Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15985)
*Sai Karthikey Pentapati,Gregoire Phillips,Alan Bovik*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for creating compact neural representations (INRs) of 3D manifold geometries (triangle meshes) using spherical parameterization and a hierarchical structure for efficient compression and real-time decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in building implicit neural representations (INRs) for triangle-mesh-based 3D geometries, which are widely used in the industry but have been sparsely studied in INR research.

Method: The proposed method uses spherical parameterization to map 3D mesh surfaces to a unit sphere. An INR encodes the displacement vector field on the sphere’s surface, reconstructing the shape hierarchically (coarse structure followed by details).

Result: The method allows real-time decoding of arbitrary-resolution 3D meshes with a state-of-the-art balance between reconstruction quality and compression size.

Conclusion: The approach effectively creates compact and efficient INRs for 3D triangle meshes, advancing their practical use in achieving high-quality compression and real-time decoding.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art compression of a broad range of modalities such as images, videos, 3D surfaces, and audio. Most studies have focused on building neural counterparts of traditional implicit representations of 3D geometries, such as signed distance functions. However, the triangle mesh-based representation of geometry remains the most widely used representation in the industry, while building INRs capable of generating them has been sparsely studied. In this paper, we present a method for building compact INRs of zero-genus 3D manifolds. Our method relies on creating a spherical parameterization of a given 3D mesh - mapping the surface of a mesh to that of a unit sphere - then constructing an INR that encodes the displacement vector field defined continuously on its surface that regenerates the original shape. The compactness of our representation can be attributed to its hierarchical structure, wherein it first recovers the coarse structure of the encoded surface before adding high-frequency details to it. Once the INR is computed, 3D meshes of arbitrary resolution/connectivity can be decoded from it. The decoding can be performed in real time while achieving a state-of-the-art trade-off between reconstruction quality and the size of the compressed representations.

*P. Urdeitx,I. Alfaro,D. Gonzalez,F. Chinesta,E. Cueto*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of Transformer architectures to address the lack of data on historical dependences in dynamical systems compared to conventional neural network models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of Transformer architectures in modeling dynamical systems with incomplete experimental data, which traditionally rely on phenomenological variables.

Method: Benchmark tests were conducted using Transformer models on three systems: cylinder flow (no historical dependence), viscoelastic Couette flow (Oldroyd-B model), and a polymeric fluid (FENE model). Results were compared to a thermodynamically consistent neural network.

Result: Transformers showed superior accuracy in scenarios with incomplete state variable data, even in lower-dimensional latent spaces. However, the thermodynamically consistent model outperformed Transformers when complete data was available.

Conclusion: Transformers offer a promising approach for handling systems with missing experimental data but are less effective than physics-preserving models in fully observable systems.

Abstract: It is well known that the lack of information about certain variables necessary for the description of a dynamical system leads to the introduction of historical dependence (lack of Markovian character of the model) and noise. Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a novel application of GNNs in the field of instrumentation design, particularly for simulating and improving the performance of high-precision physics tools like LIGO.

Method: GNNs were employed to simulate optical models of LIGO, and their performance was compared with conventional simulation packages in terms of runtime and accuracy.

Result: The GNN-based models accurately captured the complex optical physics of LIGO simulations while delivering speed improvements of 815 times over current state-of-the-art simulation methods.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of GNNs as a powerful tool for high-speed and accurate instrumentation design simulations, paving the way for new machine learning applications in physical sciences and providing a benchmarking dataset for future advancements.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown tremendous promise in solving problems in high energy physics, materials science, and fluid dynamics. In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.

*Pradeep Singh,Mudasani Rushikesh,Bezawada Sri Sai Anurag,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified narrative spanning from the Big Bang to human and artificial learning systems, linking structure formation across scales through dynamical systems and emergent patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cross-scale perspective that unifies disparate fields like cosmology, biology, and artificial intelligence by understanding them as successive dynamical systems rooted in universal mathematical principles.

Method: Using a theoretical framework based on dynamical systems and recurring mathematical motifs, the paper interprets structure formation across physical, biological, and cognitive regimes, emphasizing phase transitions and emergent attractors.

Result: A comprehensive theoretical narrative is outlined, connecting the universe's history from initial cosmic structures to advanced biological and artificial systems capable of self-modeling.

Conclusion: The evolution of the universe reflects the progression of dynamics, culminating in systems (biological and artificial) that can shape their own trajectories. The framework unites diverse scientific domains into a single, coherent perspective.

Abstract: We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UI optimization models fail to consider Cross-Responsiveness (CR) assessment, negatively impacting user interaction efficiency.

Method: CR assessment is performed using FECSM, Human-Computer Interaction features are extracted to classify UX change types employing Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU). Ultimately, UI optimization is achieved using QNDSOA.

Result: The proposed method achieves an average fitness of 98.5632% in UI design optimization.

Conclusion: Integrating CR assessment and optimization outperforms traditional methods, enhancing user satisfaction and interactivity in web environments.

Abstract: User Interface (UI) optimization is essential in the digital era to enhance user satisfaction in web environments. Nevertheless, the existing UI optimization models had overlooked the Cross-Responsiveness (CR) assessment, affecting the user interaction efficiency. Consequently, this article proposes a dynamic web UI optimization through CR assessment using Finite Exponential Continuous State Machine (FECSM) and Quokka Nonlinear Difference Swarm Optimization Algorithm (QNDSOA). Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM. Then, the proposed Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU) is used to classify the User eXperience (UX) change type, which is labelled based on the User Interface Change Prediction Index (UICPI). Lastly, a novel QNDSOA is utilized to optimize the UI design with an average fitness of 98.5632%. Feedback monitoring is done after optimal deployment.

### [377] [A Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Automated Qualitative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16063)
*Qidi Xu,Nuzha Amjad,Grace Giles,Alexa Cumming,De'angelo Hermesky,Alexander Wen,Min Ji Kwak,Yejin Kim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent framework called CoTI to automate qualitative thematic analysis, focusing on chronic disease patient experiences. It demonstrated effectiveness compared to human and baseline NLP assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to advance scalable and objective thematic analysis in patient-centered care, especially for chronic diseases requiring consistent communication.

Method: Development of CoTI, a multi-agent LLM framework consisting of three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), tested on interviews about heart failure patient perceptions on medication intensity.

Result: CoTI produced themes and codebooks aligning closer to senior investigators' analyses than junior investigators or baseline NLP models. An AI-human interaction application was also created.

Conclusion: CoTI improves thematic analysis automation but junior investigator collaboration shows limited benefits due to potential overreliance on AI, underscoring the importance of independent critical thinking.

Abstract: Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.

### [378] [Evaluation of Generative Models for Emotional 3D Animation Generation in VR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16081)
*Kiran Chhatre,Renan Guarese,Andrii Matviienko,Christopher Peters*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates emotional 3D animation models in VR, focusing on user-centric metrics like realism, naturalness, and interaction quality. It finds that current generative methods can model high-arousal emotions like happiness but struggle with subtle states like neutral.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance understanding of generative animation models’ effectiveness by evaluating their emotional quality in VR settings, addressing the limitations of traditional 2D statistical evaluation methods.

Method: The research conducted a user study with 48 participants to evaluate three speech-driven 3D animation models and compared them to real human expressions in a VR environment.

Result: Models that explicitly incorporated emotions achieved higher recognition accuracy. Happy animations were rated more positively than neutral ones, showing generative models' limitations in subtler emotions. Generative methods underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial quality, and interaction quality ratings were low.

Conclusion: Incorporating user-centric evaluations and addressing generative models' weaknesses in handling subtle emotions and interaction quality can improve the development of these systems.

Abstract: Social interactions incorporate nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.

*Claudia Vale Oliveira,Nelson Zagalo,Filipe Silva,Anabela Brandao,Syeda Faryal Hussain Khurrum,Joaquim Santos*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study analyzes errors in human-AI reasoning interactions, emphasizing how linguistic fluency and plausibility in Large Language Models (LLMs) can mask deeper distortions in meaning, influencing human judgment and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how errors in Large Language Models (LLMs) influence human interpretive judgment, addressing the relational dynamics between AI outputs and human decision-making.

Method: A three-round multi-model LLM evaluation was conducted using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated frameworks to observe evaluator interpretation across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions.

Result: Errors in LLMs evolve from predictive issues to hermeneutic forms, where surface fluency and coherence obscure deeper inaccuracies. Human evaluators often relied on intuitive heuristics, showing a systematic verification burden and reliance on surface-level cues in complex tasks, enabling plausible but incorrect answers to be perceived as credible.

Conclusion: Epistemic failures in AI are co-constructed and relational, resulting from both model-generated plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. This shift calls for reframing error evaluation as a relational and interpretive process, with implications for improving digital literacy, LLM evaluation, and trustworthy AI design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.

### [380] [Learning Confidence Ellipsoids and Applications to Robust Subspace Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16875)
*Chao Gao,Liren Shan,Vaidehi Srinivas,Aravindan Vijayaraghavan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper develops a polynomial time algorithm to find confidence ellipsoids in high dimensions, focusing on approximations when condition number is bounded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of finding minimum-volume confidence ellipsoids in high-dimensional data when direct computation is NP-hard due to increasing condition numbers.

Method: A polynomial time algorithm leveraging the primal-dual structure of the ellipsoid problem and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality.

Result: The algorithm provides ellipsoids with volume approximation of $O(β^{γd})$ compared to the best condition bounded ellipsoid and retains at least $1-O(α/γ)$ probability mass.

Conclusion: This is the first algorithm with approximation guarantees for robust subspace recovery in worst-case high-dimensional instances.

Abstract: We study the problem of finding confidence ellipsoids for an arbitrary distribution in high dimensions. Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $α$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\Pr_{D}[E] \ge 1-α$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $β$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $β$?
  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(β^{γd})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $β$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(α/γ)$ probability mass for any $γ< α$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation guarantees on worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem.

TL;DR: Large AI models enable base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, transforming them into intelligent agents for 6G systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LAMs can enhance base stations to address 6G requirements integrating intelligence, perception, and computation.

Method: Proposes IBSA architecture with cloud-edge-end collaboration, evaluates scenarios like autonomous driving and drone safety using LAM technologies.

Result: Presented an IBSA framework and analyzed enabling technologies. Highlighted a holistic evaluation approach including communication and perception metrics.

Conclusion: LAM-enabled IBSAs are practical for intelligent, integrated, safety-critical 6G systems while open challenges remain in adaptation and standardization.

Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization.

*Matteo Fasulo,Giusy Spacone,Thorir Mar Ingolfsson,Yawei Li,Luca Benini,Andrea Cossettini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: TinyMyo introduces a lightweight EMG foundation model using Transformer architecture, excelling in multi-task generalization with a compact size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EMG applications face challenges in generalizing across subjects, systems, and protocols; existing foundation models lack versatility and deployability.

Method: Developed a lightweight Transformer encoder-based model (TinyMyo), pre-trained via self-supervised learning on public datasets with high reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Achieved high performance in various tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models on datasets while maintaining under 5M parameters and enabling deployment on ultra-low-power microcontrollers.

Conclusion: TinyMyo advances EMG research with efficient multi-task capabilities, low power requirements, and open-source accessibility to drive further innovation.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality used in several domains, including biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and emerging human-machine interaction paradigms. Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\pm0.16\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\pm0.32\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\pm0.09\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW. By open-sourcing the pre-trained and the downstream task architectures (https://github.com/pulp-bio/BioFoundation), we aim to provide a flexible resource that can accelerate future research and serve as a common foundation for the EMG community.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents 'concurrence,' a method to detect statistical dependence through time-series alignment classifiers, suitable for diverse biological data without requiring large datasets or parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying complex, non-linear interactions in biological systems with current dependence-testing methods is challenging without prior knowledge or substantial datasets.

Method: The method involves assessing dependence by constructing classifiers to distinguish between aligned and misaligned segments of time series data.

Result: The authors demonstrate the theoretical link between concurrence and dependence, showing its applicability to fMRI, physiological, and behavioral datasets.

Conclusion: 'Concurrence' can serve as a universal analytic tool across scientific fields, revealing dependencies efficiently and flexibly without demanding large data or customized tuning.

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge or large datasets. We introduce a criterion for dependence, whereby two time series are deemed dependent if one can construct a classifier that distinguishes between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data.

*Chenyu Zhu,Zeyang Li,Ziyi Xie,Jie Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) using a combination of signal decomposition, temporal convolution networks, and spatial attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of using deep-learning-based methods for SEI, which often rely on large datasets or prior information, making them difficult to implement in real-world situations with limited labeled data.

Method: The method integrates a complex variational mode decomposition algorithm to process and reconstruct signals, employs a temporal convolutional network for modeling sequential characteristics, and introduces a spatial attention mechanism for weighting informative signal segments. A branch network leverages pre-trained weights to reduce dependency on auxiliary datasets.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness through ablation studies on simulated data and achieved 96% accuracy using only 10 symbols without the need for prior knowledge, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: This approach offers a lightweight and accurate solution for SEI, advancing the field by allowing high performance in scenarios with minimal labeled data and no prior knowledge.

Abstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) utilizes passive hardware characteristics to authenticate transmitters, providing a robust physical-layer security solution. However, most deep-learning-based methods rely on extensive data or require prior information, which poses challenges in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose an integrated complex variational mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes and reconstructs complex-valued signals to approximate the original transmitted signals, thereby enabling more accurate feature extraction. We further utilize a temporal convolutional network to effectively model the sequential signal characteristics, and introduce a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively weight informative signal segments, significantly enhancing identification performance. Additionally, the branch network allows leveraging pre-trained weights from other data while reducing the need for auxiliary datasets. Ablation experiments on the simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model. An accuracy comparison on a public dataset reveals that our method achieves 96% accuracy using only 10 symbols without requiring any prior knowledge.

TL;DR: BioimageAIpub is introduced as a workflow to convert and upload bioimaging data to HuggingFace, facilitating easier access and usage for machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges due to the need for large-scale datasets with quality annotations and metadata for bioimage analysis, which current repositories do not readily provide in accessible formats.

Method: The workflow, BioimageAIpub, helps automate the conversion of bioimaging (meta)data for seamless upload to HuggingFace, bypassing tedious data wrangling steps.

Result: The introduction of BioimageAIpub simplifies preparing bioimaging data for machine learning applications by enabling streamlined integration with HuggingFace.

Conclusion: BioimageAIpub reduces the burden of metadata assembly for bioimage analysis and fosters more efficient development of machine learning tools.

Abstract: Modern bioimage analysis approaches are data hungry, making it necessary for researchers to scavenge data beyond those collected within their (bio)imaging facilities. In addition to scale, bioimaging datasets must be accompanied with suitable, high-quality annotations and metadata. Although established data repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR) and BioImage Archive offer rich metadata, their contents typically cannot be directly consumed by image analysis tools without substantial data wrangling. Such a tedious assembly and conversion of (meta)data can account for a dedicated amount of time investment for researchers, hindering the development of more powerful analysis tools. Here, we introduce BioimageAIpub, a workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion, enabling a seamless upload to HuggingFace, a widely used platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating numerous AI segmentation models on imaging datasets lacking ground truth annotations.

Method: The framework harmonizes segmentation results into standard representations, enabling consistent labeling. It integrates into 3D Slicer for streamlined loading, comparison, and interactive visualization.

Result: The framework simplifies model inspection and comparison, demonstrating agreement on some anatomical structures (e.g., lung) while detecting issues with others (e.g., vertebrae, rib).

Conclusion: Resources including scripts, summaries, and tools assist in model evaluation, supporting informed model selection in the absence of ground truth.

Abstract: Purpose AI-based methods for anatomy segmentation can help automate characterization of large imaging datasets. The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations). Conclusions The resources developed are linked from https://imagingdatacommons.github.io/segmentation-comparison/ including segmentation harmonization scripts, summary plots, and visualization tools. This work assists in model evaluation in absence of ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection.

*Jin Young Kim,Jeremy Hudson,Jeongchul Kim,Qing Lyu,Christopher T. Whitlow*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCR-VQGAN, a generative model creating high-fidelity tau PET images from MRI scans to overcome limitations in Alzheimer's diagnostics such as cost and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in Alzheimer's diagnostics posed by tau PET imaging, including radiation exposure, cost, and availability, by exploring alternative imaging synthesis methods.

Method: Developing MCR-VQGAN, which integrates multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and CBAM into a generative framework, trained on paired MRI and tau PET dataset from ADNI.

Result: Achieved high synthesis performance metrics (MSE: 0.0056, PSNR: 24.39 dB, SSIM: 0.9000) and comparable diagnostic accuracy in synthetic AD detection versus real images.

Conclusion: MCR-VQGAN can replace conventional tau PET imaging for Alzheimer's diagnostics, offering enhanced scalability and reliability while retaining diagnostic efficacy.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning-based framework for analyzing multimodal X-ray images of particulate composite microstructures, offering insights to optimize materials' design and functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of utilizing large-scale, multimodal X-ray image datasets of particulate composites to derive physical insights and optimize microstructural properties.

Method: The authors develop a machine learning-enabled framework to convert X-ray images of particulate composites into topology-aware graphs, enabling physical insight extraction and microstructure-property relationship analysis.

Result: The framework demonstrates its efficacy by analyzing the cathode of solid-state lithium batteries, validating the significance of triple-phase junctions and co-conductive channels in electrochemical activity.

Conclusion: Graph-based microstructure representation is proven as an effective tool for integrating imaging and functional understanding, advancing data-driven materials design in particulate composites.

Abstract: Particulate composites underpin many solid-state chemical and electrochemical systems, where microstructural features such as multiphase boundaries and inter-particle connections strongly influence system performance. Advances in X-ray microscopy enable capturing large-scale, multimodal images of these complex microstructures with an unprecedentedly high throughput. However, harnessing these datasets to discover new physical insights and guide microstructure optimization remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a machine learning (ML) enabled framework that enables automated transformation of experimental multimodal X-ray images of multiphase particulate composites into scalable, topology-aware graphs for extracting physical insights and establishing local microstructure-property relationships at both the particle and network level. Using the multiphase particulate cathode of solid-state lithium batteries as an example, our ML-enabled graph analysis corroborates the critical role of triple phase junctions and concurrent ion/electron conduction channels in realizing desirable local electrochemical activity. Our work establishes graph-based microstructure representation as a powerful paradigm for bridging multimodal experimental imaging and functional understanding, and facilitating microstructure-aware data-driven materials design in a broad range of particulate composites.

Motivation: Improving catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis, which is hindered by complex nanoscale reactions in traditional methods.

Method: Combining knowledge-driven and data-driven insights with machine learning, utilizing electronic structure databases, NLP models, and predictive models based on experimental data.

Result: 54 catalysts were examined, identifying three promising candidates. High-throughput experiments validated the predictions, achieving semiconducting selectivity beyond 91% (up to 98.6% with FeTiO3).

Conclusion: The methodology provides a precise, scalable approach for CNT synthesis and holds potential for broader catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis advancements.

Abstract: Catalyst design is crucial for materials synthesis, especially for complex reaction networks. Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis of copper nanoparticles is challenging due to sensitivity in reaction parameters and limited access to large experimental datasets.

Method: Microwave-assisted polyol synthesis was paired with Latin Hypercube Sampling to generate a small experimental dataset, followed by ensemble regression models using the AMADEUS framework for predictive analysis.

Result: The ensemble regression models achieved $R^2 = 0.74$ in predicting particle sizes, surpassing classical statistical methods with $R^2 = 0.60$.

Conclusion: High-quality small datasets combined with interpretable ML models can efficiently optimize lab-scale inorganic synthesis, providing a sustainable and realistic pathway for data-driven materials research.

Abstract: Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction. This approach provides a sustainable and experimentally realistic pathway toward data-driven inorganic synthesis design.

*Luuk H. E. Kempen,Raffaele Cheula,Mie Andersen*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper assesses the performance of 80 machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for heterogeneous catalysis tasks and identifies their strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether foundational MLIPs, which promise ab initio accuracy, effectively address real-world applications like heterogeneous catalysis beyond limited benchmarks on ordered and bulk materials.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic zero-shot performance analysis of 80 MLIPs across diverse datasets involving tasks like adsorption and reaction on surfaces, including alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems.

Result: The study found that current MLIPs can achieve high accuracy for certain tasks, like vacancy formation energy predictions in perovskite oxides, but highlighted failures in areas like magnetic material simulations and energy predictions during structure relaxation.

Conclusion: No single MLIP performs best universally, and application suitability must be checked. While foundational MLIPs show promise, task-specific models can compete in accuracy, revealing gaps in current MLIP capabilities.

Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are being developed at a rapid pace, promising closer and closer approximation to ab initio accuracy. This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Private Virtual Tree Networks (PVTNs), a cryptographic enhancement of the VIRGO overlay, ensuring scalable, hierarchical systems with strong security and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of intrinsic security and privacy mechanisms in the VIRGO network, which models real-world hierarchical organizations.

Method: The researchers introduced PVTNs by encrypting join requests with managers' public keys, signing delegation certificates for authorization, and limiting key sharing to direct manager-member relationships, forming private and secure hierarchical structures.

Result: The system showcases scalability, dynamic management, and robust security guarantees while maintaining privacy and avoiding global public key infrastructures.

Conclusion: PVTNs effectively enhance the VIRGO network with robust security and privacy features, supporting real-world organizational hierarchies in a scalable and efficient manner.

Abstract: Hierarchical organization is a fundamental structure in real-world society, where authority and responsibility are delegated from managers to subordinates. The VIRGO network (Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for scalable grid computing) provides a scalable overlay for organizing distributed systems but lacks intrinsic security and privacy mechanisms. This paper proposes Private Virtual Tree Networks (PVTNs), a cryptographically enforced extension that leverages the VIRGO overlay to mirror real organizational hierarchies. In PVTNs, join requests are encrypted with the manager's public key to ensure confidentiality, while membership authorization is enforced through manager-signed delegation certificates. Public keys are treated as organizational secrets and are disclosed only within direct manager-member relationships, resulting in a private, non-enumerable virtual tree. Our work demonstrates, through the system model, protocols, security analysis, and design rationale, that PVTNs achieve scalability, dynamic management, and strong security guarantees without relying on global public key infrastructures.

*Nikodem Tomczak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The Lockchain Protocol enhances Bitcoin transaction discovery and verification efficiently without added block space costs or new on-chain storage, by repurposing the nLockTime field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve transaction discovery and data verification efficiency in Bitcoin while minimizing resource usage and maintaining compatibility with Bitcoin rules.

Method: Repurpose the Bitcoin nLockTime field to encode protocol metadata, using values from an unused range to enable efficient indexing and filtering by transaction headers.

Result: The protocol streamlines transaction discovery, allowing indexers to filter by fixed-size headers before inspecting heavier transaction data.

Conclusion: The Lockchain Protocol effectively optimizes transaction discovery in Bitcoin without introducing cryptographic or storage innovations but provides scalable solutions to the existing challenges.

Abstract: We describe the Lockchain Protocol, a lightweight Bitcoin meta-protocol that enables highly efficient transaction discovery at zero marginal block space cost, and data verification without introducing any new on-chain storage mechanism. The protocol repurposes the mandatory 4-byte nLockTime field of every Bitcoin transaction as a compact metadata header. By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods.

*Perry Abdulkadir*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating safety guardrail design for large language models (LLMs) as a hyperparameter optimization problem over a fixed base model, showing potential improvements in efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness, inefficiency, and irreproducibility of hand-tuned safety guardrails for LLMs, especially in scenarios where product teams cannot modify model weights.

Method: The study uses a modular approach by wrapping a Mistral-7B-Instruct model with jailbreak and malware system prompts along with a harmfulness classifier. It evaluates configurations through grid search and black-box optimization using Optuna on benchmarks measuring safety and latency.

Result: The black-box Optuna optimization rediscovered the best configurations from grid search, needing significantly fewer evaluations and about 8x less time while addressing the safety concerns efficiently.

Conclusion: Treating safety guardrail design as a hyperparameter optimization problem is a viable strategy for improving LLM safety, especially in resource-constrained black-box environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed behind safety guardrails such as system prompts and content filters, especially in settings where product teams cannot modify model weights. In practice these guardrails are typically hand-tuned, brittle, and difficult to reproduce. This paper studies a simple but practical alternative: treat safety guardrail design itself as a hyperparameter optimization problem over a frozen base model. Concretely, I wrap Mistral-7B-Instruct with modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier, then evaluate candidate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Each configuration is scored using malware and jailbreak attack success rate, benign harmful-response rate, and end-to-end latency. A 48-point grid search over prompt combinations and filter modes establishes a baseline. I then run a black-box Optuna study over the same space and show that it reliably rediscovers the best grid configurations while requiring an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and roughly 8x less wall-clock time. The results suggest that viewing safety guardrails as tunable hyperparameters is a feasible way to harden black-box LLM deployments under compute and time constraints.

*Jacob Choi,Shuying Cao,Xingjian Dong,Wang Bill Zhu,Robin Jia,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ContextLeak is a novel framework designed to measure information leakage in In-Context Learning (ICL) processes, emphasizing the need for privacy-preserving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many privacy-preserving techniques exist for ICL, there is a lack of reliable auditing mechanisms to evaluate their effectiveness against unintended information leakage.

Method: ContextLeak inserts unique tokens (canary insertion) into task prompts and crafts targeted queries to detect sensitive information leakage. It evaluates heuristic and theoretically grounded privacy mechanisms.

Result: ContextLeak accurately correlates with theoretical privacy budgets and exposes that current methods either compromise privacy or utility. It demonstrates the shortcomings of existing privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: Reliable auditing via ContextLeak is essential for privacy in ICL, urging improvements in methods to achieve better privacy-utility balance.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a standard technique for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks by supplying task-specific exemplars within the prompt. However, when these exemplars contain sensitive information, reliable privacy-preserving mechanisms are essential to prevent unintended leakage through model outputs. Many privacy-preserving methods are proposed to protect the information leakage in the context, but there are less efforts on how to audit those methods. We introduce ContextLeak, the first framework to empirically measure the worst-case information leakage in ICL. ContextLeak uses canary insertion, embedding uniquely identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting targeted queries to detect their presence. We apply ContextLeak across a range of private ICL techniques, both heuristic such as prompt-based defenses and those with theoretical guarantees such as Embedding Space Aggregation and Report Noisy Max. We find that ContextLeak tightly correlates with the theoretical privacy budget ($ε$) and reliably detects leakage. Our results further reveal that existing methods often strike poor privacy-utility trade-offs, either leaking sensitive information or severely degrading performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DualGuard is a watermarking algorithm designed to protect LLMs against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks. It introduces adaptive dual-stream mechanisms for secure watermarking and attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing accessibility of LLMs via cloud services increases the risk of model abuse, necessitating secure watermarking approaches to safeguard intellectual property and prevent misuse.

Method: DualGuard uses an adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism. It dynamically injects two complementary watermark signals based on semantic content, enhancing detection and traceability against spoofing and paraphrase attacks.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate the effectiveness of DualGuard in detection, robustness, traceability, and maintaining text quality.

Conclusion: DualGuard advances LLM watermarking technology by reliably defending against complex misuse scenarios, paving the way for secure and trustworthy real-world applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud-based services, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly accessible through various web platforms. However, this accessibility has also led to growing risks of model abuse. LLM watermarking has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate such misuse and protect intellectual property. Existing watermarking algorithms, however, primarily focus on defending against paraphrase attacks while overlooking piggyback spoofing attacks, which can inject harmful content, compromise watermark reliability, and undermine trust in attribution. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard, the first watermarking algorithm capable of defending against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks. DualGuard employs the adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism, in which two complementary watermark signals are dynamically injected based on the semantic content. This design enables DualGuard not only to detect but also to trace spoofing attacks, thereby ensuring reliable and trustworthy watermark detection. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and language models demonstrate that DualGuard achieves excellent detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality, effectively advancing the state of LLM watermarking for real-world applications.

### [397] [Agent Tools Orchestration Leaks More: Dataset, Benchmark, and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16310)
*Yuxuan Qiao,Dongqin Liu,Hongchang Yang,Wei Zhou,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies a privacy risk in multi-tool autonomous agents, introduces a framework and benchmark to study it, and proposes a mitigation method to reduce the risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in multi-tool autonomous agents, which synthesize sensitive information while optimizing for helpfulness, without sufficient privacy safeguards.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic study, developed the TOP-Bench framework for evaluating privacy risk, introduced the H-Score metric, and proposed the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method.

Result: They found most models had high Risk Leakage Rates (90.24%) and low H-Scores (0.167). The proposed PEP method lowered the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and increased the H-Score to 0.624.

Conclusion: The study highlights a significant privacy issue in single-agent, multi-tool architectures, establishes structural challenges, and offers a viable mitigation strategy to address the identified risks.

Abstract: Driven by Large Language Models, the single-agent, multi-tool architecture has become a popular paradigm for autonomous agents due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies.

### [398] [From Essence to Defense: Adaptive Semantic-aware Watermarking for Embedding-as-a-Service Copyright Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16439)
*Hao Li,Yubing Ren,Yanan Cao,Yingjie Li,Fang Fang,Xuebin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemMark, a semantic-based watermarking system for protecting Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) against imitation attacks, optimizing stealthiness and harmlessness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EaaS, a valuable paradigm, is susceptible to imitation attacks, while current copyright protection methods lack semantic consideration, affecting their effectiveness.

Method: SemMark uses locality-sensitive hashing for semantic space partitioning and semantic-aware watermarking. Adaptive watermark weights further preserve original embedding distribution integrity.

Result: SemMark outperformed prior methods in verifiability, stealthiness, diversity, and harmlessness across various evaluation scenarios using NLP datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of SemMark as a superior mechanism for EaaS copyright protection by addressing semantic vulnerabilities overlooked by prior methodologies.

Abstract: Benefiting from the superior capabilities of large language models in natural language understanding and generation, Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) has emerged as a successful commercial paradigm on the web platform. However, prior studies have revealed that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks. Existing methods protect the intellectual property of EaaS through watermarking techniques, but they all ignore the most important properties of embedding: semantics, resulting in limited harmlessness and stealthiness. To this end, we propose SemMark, a novel semantic-based watermarking paradigm for EaaS copyright protection. SemMark employs locality-sensitive hashing to partition the semantic space and inject semantic-aware watermarks into specific regions, ensuring that the watermark signals remain imperceptible and diverse. In addition, we introduce the adaptive watermark weight mechanism based on the local outlier factor to preserve the original embedding distribution. Furthermore, we propose Detect-Sampling and Dimensionality-Reduction attacks and construct four scenarios to evaluate the watermarking method. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular NLP datasets, and SemMark achieves superior verifiability, diversity, stealthiness, and harmlessness.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores post-hoc watermarking, where existing text is rewritten with AI-generated watermarking signals for traceability. It examines approaches, performance, and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect copyrighted documents and trace AI-generated content to prevent misuse in training or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Method: Uses post-hoc watermarking by rewriting text via LLMs with statistical signals. It evaluates various strategies like beam search, multi-candidate generation, entropy filtering, and model sizing.

Result: Findings show strong detectability and preservation of meaning in open-ended text but struggle with verifiable text such as code. Smaller models perform better on the latter.

Conclusion: The study highlights the promise and constraints of post-hoc watermarking, offering insights for future developments in securing AI-generated or rewritten content.

Abstract: Generation-time text watermarking embeds statistical signals into text for traceability of AI-generated content. We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research.

Motivation: To address the scarcity of cyberattack data that limits development of robust intrusion detection systems.

Method: PHANTOM employs progressive training, a dual-path VAE-GAN architecture, and domain-specific feature matching to generate semantically accurate synthetic data.

Result: PHANTOM's synthetic data enables 98% weighted accuracy on real attack data and preserves authenticity and diversity, though generating rare attack types remains a challenge.

Abstract: The scarcity of cyberattack data hinders the development of robust intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces PHANTOM, a novel adversarial variational framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic attack data. Its innovations include progressive training, a dual-path VAE-GAN architecture, and domain-specific feature matching to preserve the semantics of attacks. Evaluated on 100,000 network traffic samples, models trained on PHANTOM data achieve 98% weighted accuracy on real attacks. Statistical analyses confirm that the synthetic data preserves authentic distributions and diversity. Limitations in generating rare attack types are noted, highlighting challenges with severe class imbalance. This work advances the generation of synthetic data for training robust, privacy-preserving detection systems.

*Junchi Lu,Xinke Li,Yuheng Liu,Qi Alfred Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates security threats posed by generative models like diffusion models in data pipelines, emphasizing backdoor propagation and its potential risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked security risks in generative data pipelines, particularly the propagation of backdoors via diffusion models into downstream tasks.

Method: Analyzed how diffusion models memorized and reproduced backdoor triggers, focusing on clean-label attacks and introducing the Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon.

Result: Found diffusion models can inherit backdoor triggers, which propagate to downstream models, leading to security vulnerabilities even under clean-label attacks.

Conclusion: Exposure of critical security threats in synthetic data pipelines and initial steps for mitigating vulnerabilities introduced by generative models.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative models such as diffusion models for synthetic data augmentation has greatly reduced the cost of data collection and labeling in downstream perception tasks. However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples. Overall, this work reveals a previously underexplored threat in generative data pipelines and provides initial insights toward mitigating backdoor risks in synthetic data generation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need to align Indian criminal jurisprudence with AI-integrated computational forensics, addressing gaps in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, in handling adversarial AI threats like anti-forensics and deepfakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies in India's computational forensic framework, particularly concerning the DPDP Act, 2023, when faced with adversarial AI threats, thus ensuring robust digital privacy and evidence integrity.

Method: The authors adopted a doctrinal legal methodology, performing statutory analysis of India's DPDP Act while comparing it with global frameworks like IEEE and EU standards.

Result: Preliminary findings show that while AI enhances forensic pattern recognition, it introduces risks such as data poisoning, algorithmic bias, and inadequacies in legal definitions for AI-driven crimes.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a human-centric forensic model emphasizing explainable AI (XAI) while urging synchronization of Indian privacy laws with global forensic standards to mitigate AI-driven risks and enhance legislative and technical frameworks.

Abstract: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence into the digital ecosystem necessitates a critical re-evaluation of Indian criminal jurisprudence regarding computational forensics integrity. While algorithmic efficiency enhances evidence extraction, a research gap exists regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023's compatibility with adversarial AI threats, specifically anti-forensics and deepfakes. This study scrutinizes the AI "dual-use" dilemma, functioning as both a cyber-threat vector and forensic automation mechanism, to delineate privacy boundaries in high-stakes investigations. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the research synthesizes statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks (IEEE, EU) to evaluate regulatory efficacy. Preliminary results indicate that while Machine Learning offers high accuracy in pattern recognition, it introduces vulnerabilities regarding data poisoning and algorithmic bias. Findings highlight a critical tension between the Act's data minimization principles and forensic data retention requirements. Furthermore, the paper identifies that existing legal definitions inadequately encompass AI-driven "tool crimes" and "target crimes." Consequently, the research proposes a "human-centric" forensic model prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) to ensure evidence admissibility. These implications suggest that synchronizing Indian privacy statutes with international forensic standards is imperative to mitigate synthetic media risks, establishing a roadmap for future legislative amendments and technical standardization.

### [403] [VET Your Agent: Towards Host-Independent Autonomy via Verifiable Execution Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15892)
*Artem Grigor,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Simon Birnbach,Ivan Martinovic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents VET, a framework for achieving verifiable and host-independent authentication for autonomous agents operating over sustained periods, enabling reliable execution in adversarial environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing deployment of autonomous LLM-based agents in critical domains, but the lack of trust in host infrastructure hampers their autonomy, risking tampering or misuse.

Method: The authors propose the VET framework which employs Agent Identity Documents (AIDs) and supports compositional proof systems like trusted hardware and notarized Web Proofs to authenticate agent outputs independently of the host.

Result: The evaluation showed that practical, host-independent authentication is feasible using existing technologies like Web Proofs, which have manageable overhead for API calls.

Conclusion: VET enables autonomous agents to operate with verifiable and host-independent authentication, paving the way for fully autonomous systems in sensitive and high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new generation of autonomous agents that operate over sustained periods and manage sensitive resources on behalf of users. Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.
  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).
  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.

*Sanjay Das,Swastik Bhattacharya,Shamik Kundu,Arnab Raha,Souvik Kundu,Kanad Basu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the vulnerability of state-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba-based architectures, to hardware-based bit-flip attacks and shows their significant susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the robustness of SSMs, which are emerging as efficient alternatives to transformers, especially against hardware-induced threats.

Method: The authors propose RAMBO, a framework specifically designed to execute bit-flip attacks on Mamba-based architectures, and test its impact on performance using the Mamba-1.4b model on the LAMBADA task.

Result: A single bit flip in the Mamba-1.4b model led to a drastic drop in accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increased perplexity significantly to 3.75 x 10^6.

Conclusion: SSMs, despite their efficiency and scalability, are highly vulnerable to bit-flip attacks, highlighting critical security concerns for real-world deployments.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), exemplified by the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as state-of-the-art sequence-modeling frameworks, offering linear-time scalability together with strong performance in long-context settings. Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6. These results demonstrate the pronounced fragility of SSMs to adversarial perturbations.

*Sudhanshu Sekhar Tripathy,Bichitrananda Behera*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study optimizes Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for Network Intrusion Detection Systems, with SVM reaching 99.12% accuracy using the 1999 KDD CUP dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of sophisticated cyber threats, there is a need for advanced detection methods that can identify novel intrusions and deviations in network behavior.

Method: The research tested and optimized 14 ML classifiers on the KDD CUP 1999 dataset using grid/random search for hyper-parameter tuning and employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) during a tenfold cross-validation.

Result: Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best accuracy (99.12%) and lowest False Alarm Rate (0.0091) after optimization.

Conclusion: Optimized ML methods, specifically SVM, provide significant improvements in detecting network intrusions, validating their adaptability and reliability for this purpose.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential for securing networks by identifying and mitigating unauthorized activities indicative of cyberattacks. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy through analyzing intricate structures in deep-featured network traffic records. Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers. This result confirms that SVM accomplishes the highest accuracy among the evaluated classifiers. We validated the effectiveness of all classifiers using a tenfold cross-validation approach, incorporating Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection to enhance the classifiers accuracy and efficiency. Our outcomes indicate that ML classifiers are both adaptable and reliable, contributing to enhanced accuracy in systems for detecting network intrusions.

*Apurva Shet,Izzat Alsmadi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study analyzes zero-day vulnerabilities disclosed by the Zero Day Initiative between January-April 2024, focusing on trends, severity, and predictive modeling for effective management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-day vulnerabilities are critical threats as they exploit unknown flaws before fixes are available, requiring better strategies to mitigate their damage and enhance organizational security.

Method: The study leverages a dataset of 415 ZDI-reported vulnerabilities, analyzing metadata and textual descriptions. It employs classical machine learning and deep learning models to classify severity levels.

Result: Key trends in zero-day disclosures, vendor-specific severity distributions, and characteristics linked to high-severity vulnerabilities were identified. Comparative analysis of machine learning models was conducted for severity prediction.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights to improve patch prioritization, vulnerability management, and organizational preparedness against zero-day threats.

Abstract: Zero-day vulnerabilities represent some of the most critical threats in cybersecurity, as they correspond to previously unknown flaws in software or hardware that are actively exploited before vendors can develop and deploy patches. During this exposure window, affected systems remain defenseless, making zero-day attacks particularly damaging and difficult to mitigate. This study analyzes the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) vulnerability disclosures reported between January and April 2024, Cole [2025] comprising a total of 415 vulnerabilities. The dataset includes vulnerability identifiers, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.0 scores, publication dates, and short textual descriptions. The primary objectives of this work are to identify trends in zero-day vulnerability disclosures, examine severity distributions across vendors, and investigate which vulnerability characteristics are most indicative of high severity. In addition, this study explores predictive modeling approaches for severity classification, comparing classical machine learning techniques with deep learning models using both structured metadata and unstructured textual descriptions. The findings aim to support improved patch prioritization strategies, more effective vulnerability management, and enhanced organizational preparedness against emerging zero-day threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high bandwidth and latency challenges of real-time AR/VR immersive formats such as 360° and 6DoF point cloud videos.

Method: A system is designed that performs downsampling and partial encryption at the server, followed by ML-based super-resolution-driven upscaling and decryption on the client side.

Result: The system achieves near-linear reductions in bandwidth/latency and encryption/decryption overhead for lower resolutions, with successful reconstruction of full-resolution point clouds with minimal errors.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces the latency and bandwidth demands while preserving the quality of immersive content through super-resolution techniques.

Abstract: Immersive formats such as 360° and 6DoF point cloud videos require high bandwidth and low latency, posing challenges for real-time AR/VR streaming. This work focuses on reducing bandwidth consumption and encryption/decryption delay, two key contributors to overall latency. We design a system that downsamples point cloud content at the origin server and applies partial encryption. At the client, the content is decrypted and upscaled using an ML-based super-resolution model. Our evaluation demonstrates a nearly linear reduction in bandwidth/latency, and encryption/decryption overhead with lower downsampling resolutions, while the super-resolution model effectively reconstructs the original full-resolution point clouds with minimal error and modest inference time.

*Min Geun Song,Gang Min Kim,Woonmin Kim,Yongsik Kim,Jeonghyun Sim,Sangbeom Park,Huy Kang Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an autoencoder-based denoising defense method to improve object detection performance against adversarial attacks, specifically using Perlin noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models, crucial in applications like autonomous driving and security systems, are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A defense mechanism is needed to safeguard their reliability.

Method: An autoencoder-based denoising method was developed, employing a single-layer convolutional autoencoder to mitigate adversarial perturbations brought by Perlin noise in images from the COCO dataset.

Result: Adversarial attacks worsened detection performance, reducing bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640. The defense achieved partial recovery, improving bbox mAP to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and bbox mAP@50 from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement).

Conclusion: While the autoencoder defense provides partial recovery of detection performance degraded by adversarial attacks, it highlights the need for further exploration to achieve robust defenses without retraining models.

Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection models play a critical role in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose an autoencoder-based denoising defense to recover object detection performance degraded by adversarial perturbations. We conduct adversarial attacks using Perlin noise on vehicle-related images from the COCO dataset, apply a single-layer convolutional autoencoder to remove the perturbations, and evaluate detection performance using YOLOv5. Our experiments demonstrate that adversarial attacks reduce bbox mAP from 0.2890 to 0.1640, representing a 43.3% performance degradation. After applying the proposed autoencoder defense, bbox mAP improves to 0.1700 (3.7% recovery) and bbox mAP@50 increases from 0.2780 to 0.3080 (10.8% improvement). These results indicate that autoencoder-based denoising can provide partial defense against adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining.

*Zhexi Lu,Hongliang Chi,Nathalie Baracaldo,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Yuseok Jeon,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ICP-MIA, a novel framework to enhance membership inference attacks (MIAs) using a training dynamics-based approach for large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy threats posed by MIAs in fine-tuned LLMs, particularly when sensitive data is used, and overcome the limitations of prior black-box MIA techniques which struggle with low generalization and high noise.

Method: The paper leverages the Optimization Gap, a signal derived from training dynamics, as an indicator of membership status. ICP-MIA estimates this gap in a black-box setting using a training-free method called In-Context Probing (ICP). Two probing strategies, reference-data-based and self-perturbation, are proposed for simulating fine-tuning behavior.

Result: Through experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks, ICP-MIA demonstrated significantly better performance than prior black-box techniques, especially at low false positive rates. The study also explored factors like model type and training configuration that influence its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ICP-MIA is a robust, practical, and theoretically founded framework for assessing privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs, offering a significant improvement over existing MIA approaches.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical privacy threat to fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), especially when models are adapted to domain-specific tasks using sensitive data. While prior black-box MIA techniques rely on confidence scores or token likelihoods, these signals are often entangled with a sample's intrinsic properties - such as content difficulty or rarity - leading to poor generalization and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose ICP-MIA, a novel MIA framework grounded in the theory of training dynamics, particularly the phenomenon of diminishing returns during optimization. We introduce the Optimization Gap as a fundamental signal of membership: at convergence, member samples exhibit minimal remaining loss-reduction potential, while non-members retain significant potential for further optimization. To estimate this gap in a black-box setting, we propose In-Context Probing (ICP), a training-free method that simulates fine-tuning-like behavior via strategically constructed input contexts. We propose two probing strategies: reference-data-based (using semantically similar public samples) and self-perturbation (via masking or generation). Experiments on three tasks and multiple LLMs show that ICP-MIA significantly outperforms prior black-box MIAs, particularly at low false positive rates. We further analyze how reference data alignment, model type, PEFT configurations, and training schedules affect attack effectiveness. Our findings establish ICP-MIA as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for auditing privacy risks in deployed LLMs.

*Xiao Li,Yue Li,Hao Wu,Yue Zhang,Yechao Zhang,Fengyuan Xu,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines the effects of code obfuscation techniques on large language models (LLM) used for code vulnerability detection across multiple programming languages and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to assess the reliability and robustness of LLMs in detecting vulnerabilities, especially in the presence of adversarial settings like code obfuscation.

Method: A structured systematization of obfuscation techniques was implemented. These techniques were categorized into layout, data flow, and control flow, tested across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, Python), and evaluated using 15 LLMs and two coding agents.

Result: Findings highlight both positive and negative impacts of obfuscation on LLM vulnerability detection, influenced by vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of understanding and improving robustness in LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection amidst obfuscation challenges, suggesting areas for further research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.

TL;DR: Romance-baiting scams, driven by organized crime using forced labor, are being increasingly automated with Large Language Models (LLMs), which outperform humans in eliciting trust and compliance. Current defenses fail to detect these scams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over the growing financial and emotional harm caused by romance-baiting scams raise urgent questions about how text-based operations might exploit LLM automation.

Method: Interviews with insiders and victims (150 participants), a blinded conversation study comparing LLM agents to human operators, and assessments of commercial safety filters.

Result: LLMs are already used in scam operations, successfully automating conversational tasks. They elicited higher trust and compliance than human operators, while safety filters failed to detect any romance-baiting dialogues.

Conclusion: Romance-baiting scams are likely amenable to full LLM automation, highlighting a deficiency in current defenses against such practices.

Abstract: Romance-baiting scams have become a major source of financial and emotional harm worldwide. These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.
  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.

*Safwan Shaheer,G. M. Refatul Islam,Mohammad Rafid Hamid,Tahsin Zaman Jilan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on combating prompt injection attacks in small open-sourced LLaMA models by introducing an innovative defense framework, refining defenses iteratively, and showcasing improved attack mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the pressing security vulnerabilities of prompt injection attacks in small, open-sourced LLMs, especially considering their potential for widespread adaptation and deployment in edge devices.

Method: The authors developed and systematically evaluated a novel defense mechanism by refining defense prompts iteratively, leveraging a framework based on Chain Of Thoughts to tackle security vulnerabilities posed by prompt injection attacks.

Result: The proposed methods significantly reduced attack success rates and false detection rates while improving the detection of goal-hijacking attempts in LLaMA models.

Conclusion: This research provides a robust framework to enhance the security of small open-sourced LLMs, advancing secure deployments in real-world, resource-limited settings.

Abstract: In this fast-evolving area of LLMs, our paper discusses the significant security risk presented by prompt injection attacks. It focuses on small open-sourced models, specifically the LLaMA family of models. We introduce novel defense mechanisms capable of generating automatic defenses and systematically evaluate said generated defenses against a comprehensive set of benchmarked attacks. Thus, we empirically demonstrated the improvement proposed by our approach in mitigating goal-hijacking vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our work recognizes the increasing relevance of small open-sourced LLMs and their potential for broad deployments on edge devices, aligning with future trends in LLM applications. We contribute to the greater ecosystem of open-source LLMs and their security in the following: (1) assessing present prompt-based defenses against the latest attacks, (2) introducing a new framework using a seed defense (Chain Of Thoughts) to refine the defense prompts iteratively, and (3) showing significant improvements in detecting goal hijacking attacks. Out strategies significantly reduce the success rates of the attacks and false detection rates while at the same time effectively detecting goal-hijacking capabilities, paving the way for more secure and efficient deployments of small and open-source LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [413] [Protecting Deep Neural Network Intellectual Property with Chaos-Based White-Box Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16658)
*Sangeeth B,Serena Nicolazzo,Deepa K.,Vinod P*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a white-box watermarking framework for protecting the ownership of deep neural networks, embedding chaotic sequence-based watermarks into internal parameters without affecting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing need to protect intellectual property and prevent misuse of deep neural networks, which are valuable assets built with significant investment and are vulnerable to unauthorized copying and redistribution.

Method: The authors propose embedding chaotic sequence-based watermarks (generated using a logistic map) into the internal weights of a deep neural network without structural modifications or performance loss, paired with a genetic algorithm-based verification process.

Result: Extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets showcase the watermark's resilience to fine-tuning with minimal accuracy reduction, along with visual and activation-based analyses proving ownership.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective, flexible, and scalable framework for embedding and verifying ownership information in DNNs, aligning with real-world intellectual property protection scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of deep neural networks (DNNs) across several domains has led to increasing concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and model misuse. Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical.

### [414] [PrivateXR: Defending Privacy Attacks in Extended Reality Through Explainable AI-Guided Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16851)
*Ripan Kumar Kundu,Istiak Ahmed,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining explainable AI and differential privacy for AI XR systems, improving privacy without excessively degrading accuracy or inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in AI XR systems arise due to sensitive data like eye-tracking, as adversaries can exploit such data for harmful attacks. Current mitigation methods, such as differential privacy, struggle in balancing privacy protection and system performance in real-time scenarios.

Method: The framework uses explainable AI (XAI) to determine the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively applies differential privacy to these features during inference to mitigate privacy attacks.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces the success rates of privacy attacks (up to 43% for MIA and 39% for RDA) while retaining high model accuracy (up to 97%) and improving inference speed (~2x) compared to traditional DP approaches.

Conclusion: This XAI-guided DP approach effectively balances privacy protection and model utility in AI XR systems, and its practicality is demonstrated through deployment on an HTC VIVE headset with a customizable privacy-adjustment interface, enhancing real-time user protection during XR applications.

Abstract: The convergence of artificial AI and XR technologies (AI XR) promises innovative applications across many domains. However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework to improve the encoding of user-generated content videos, addressing challenges caused by their variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of encoding optimization due to high variability in UGC videos, which affects the performance of data-driven machine learning algorithms.

Method: The authors propose a framework with three adaptive mechanisms: preprocessing intensity regulation, quantization level fine-tuning, and lambda tradeoff adjustment.

Result: The proposed method showed exceptional performance on large-scale test sets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework successfully improves encoding optimization for UGC videos, making it suitable for addressing diverse video characteristics.

Abstract: In recent years, user generated content (UGC) has become the dominant force in internet traffic. However, UGC videos exhibit a higher degree of variability and diverse characteristics compared to traditional encoding test videos. This variance challenges the effectiveness of data-driven machine learning algorithms for optimizing encoding in the broader context of UGC scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework for UGC. Firstly, we employ an adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity. Secondly, an adaptive quantization level is employed to fine-tune the codec simulator. Thirdly, we utilize an adaptive lambda tradeoff to adjust the rate-distortion loss function. Experimental results on large-scale test sets demonstrate that our method attains exceptional performance.

TL;DR: The study introduces Value Lens, a generative AI-based text model to detect human values, demonstrating its effectiveness in alignment with human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous decision-making systems by ensuring decisions align with human values.

Method: Value Lens operates in two stages: formulating a formal theory of values using LLMs verified by experts, and then detecting and reviewing value presence in texts using a pair of LLMs.

Result: Value Lens performs on par with or better than other models for detecting human values in text.

Conclusion: The proposed Value Lens model successfully aligns autonomous decision-making systems with human values, utilizing a rigorous two-stage method and LLMs for superior performance.

Abstract: The autonomous decision-making process, which is increasingly applied to computer systems, requires that the choices made by these systems align with human values. In this context, systems must assess how well their decisions reflect human values. To achieve this, it is essential to identify whether each available action promotes or undermines these values. This article presents Value Lens, a text-based model designed to detect human values using generative artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed model operates in two stages: the first aims to formulate a formal theory of values, while the second focuses on identifying these values within a given text. In the first stage, an LLM generates a description based on the established theory of values, which experts then verify. In the second stage, a pair of LLMs is employed: one LLM detects the presence of values, and the second acts as a critic and reviewer of the detection process. The results indicate that Value Lens performs comparably to, and even exceeds, the effectiveness of other models that apply different methods for similar tasks.

*Jhessica Silva,Diego A. B. Moreira,Gabriel O. dos Santos,Alef Ferreira,Helena Maia,Sandra Avila,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) for language models, focusing on their practical application and identifying their limitations, particularly for Portuguese language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure responsible development and deployment of language models given their societal impact, while addressing the inadequacies in existing AIETs related to documentation, practical examples, and effectiveness.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review of 213 AIETs, selected four tools (Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, Harms Modeling), and interviewed language model developers for evaluation, focusing on ethical considerations and quality.

Result: The four AIETs helped formulate general ethical considerations for language models but lacked specificity to address unique issues like idiomatic expressions and identifying negative impacts for Portuguese language models.

Conclusion: While AIETs provide general ethical guidance for language models, they require improvement to address language-specific nuances and potential harms effectively.

Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure fairness and impartiality in large language models (LLMs) for their safe and responsible deployment in decision-making and information retrieval.

Method: The study employs experiments addressing biases in five domains: news summarization for political neutrality, news stance classification for ideological bias, UN voting patterns for geopolitical alliances, multilingual story completion for language bias, and using World Values Survey responses for gender-related affinities.

Result: The study shows that while the tested LLMs aim for neutrality, they still exhibit various biases and affinities across the explored dimensions.

Conclusion: LLMs must be critically evaluated and improved to align with impartial standards across diverse societal contexts to address evident biases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become indispensable tools for acquiring information and supporting human decision-making. However, ensuring that these models uphold fairness across varied contexts is critical to their safe and responsible deployment. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive examination of four widely adopted LLMs, probing their underlying biases and inclinations across the dimensions of politics, ideology, alliance, language, and gender. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we investigate their political neutrality using news summarization, ideological biases through news stance classification, tendencies toward specific geopolitical alliances via United Nations voting patterns, language bias in the context of multilingual story completion, and gender-related affinities as revealed by responses to the World Values Survey. Results indicate that while the LLMs are aligned to be neutral and impartial, they still show biases and affinities of different types.

### [420] [Explainable Ethical Assessment on Human Behaviors by Generating Conflicting Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15793)
*Yuxi Sun,Wei Gao,Hongzhan Lin,Jing Ma,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClarityEthic, a novel approach to improve AI's moral reasoning and valence prediction by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems currently lack trustworthiness when predicting valence of human behavior due to absence of explicit, explainable social norms in their methods.

Method: The proposed method, ClarityEthic, enhances moral reasoning capabilities of AI models using a contrastive learning strategy to account for conflicting social norms.

Result: Experiments show ClarityEthic outperforms baseline models, and human evaluations confirm the plausibility of social norms generated by the method.

Conclusion: ClarityEthic strengthens AI's ability to predict and explain valence of human actions by incorporating nuanced social norms, enhancing trustworthiness and understanding.

Abstract: Human behaviors are often guided or constrained by social norms, which are defined as shared, commonsense rules. For example, underlying an action ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \textit{bravery} against \textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline approaches, and human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations for the assessment of human behaviors.

TL;DR: Researchers developed a framework to analyze bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages using explicit and implicit measurement methods. They found substantial variations in bias across languages and types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a research gap in assessing and understanding bias in LLMs across multilingual contexts and different bias dimensions.

Method: The study combined explicit bias evaluation via the BBQ benchmark and implicit bias measurement through a prompt-based Implicit Association Test, translated into five languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, French, Spanish).

Result: The analysis revealed significant differences in bias levels among languages used in LLMs, with Arabic and Spanish showing higher stereotype bias and Chinese and English showing lower bias levels. It also highlighted differences in explicit and implicit biases, especially in terms of age-related bias.

Conclusion: This research presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing cross-lingual bias in LLMs, laying a foundation for creating fair and effective multilingual models.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative multilingual bias evaluation framework for assessing bias in Large Language Models, combining explicit bias assessment through the BBQ benchmark with implicit bias measurement using a prompt-based Implicit Association Test. By translating the prompts and word list into five target languages, English, Chinese, Arabic, French, and Spanish, we directly compare different types of bias across languages. The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types. Age shows the lowest explicit bias but the highest implicit bias, emphasizing the importance of detecting implicit biases that are undetectable with standard benchmarks. These findings indicate that LLMs vary significantly across languages and bias dimensions. This study fills a key research gap by providing a comprehensive methodology for cross-lingual bias analysis. Ultimately, our work establishes a foundation for the development of equitable multilingual LLMs, ensuring fairness and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures.

TL;DR: This paper explores how AI challenges cultural rights and the right to development, analyzing their interplay within international human rights law and AI governance frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of AI on cultural rights and the right to development, and to address the challenges AI poses to their realization amidst societal and economic inequalities.

Method: The paper conceptually examines AI's limitations and its effects on cultural and developmental rights, identifies gaps in AI governance frameworks, and situates these issues within the global AI and human rights discourse.

Result: It highlights the normative and practical gaps in emerging AI governance frameworks related to cultural rights and the right to development.

Conclusion: The paper enriches discussions on the ethics and governance of AI by aligning cultural and developmental rights within the broader framework of human rights, and suggests pathways for future research and policy-making.

Abstract: Cultural rights and the right to development are essential norms within the wider framework of international human rights law. However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development.
  By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law. Finally, it outlines avenues for future research and policy development based on existing conversations in global AI governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cloud-centric nature of current AI deployments leads to significant environmental impacts due to high computational demands. The authors aim to explore alternative models that combine AI advancements with sustainability.

Method: The study relied on secondary research and primary data from focus groups and interviews with AI professionals to propose and analyze a conceptual framework for agentic environments.

Result: Agentic environments were found to optimize resource utilization, reduce environmental impact, enhance data privacy, and promote sustainability.

Conclusion: A sustainability-focused approach utilizing edge computing and decentralized AI solutions can reduce dependency on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures, offering a path to more sustainable AI practices.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), have made human-computer interactions more frequent, efficient, and accessible across sectors ranging from banking to healthcare. AI tools embedded in digital devices support decision-making and operational management at both individual and organizational levels, including resource allocation, workflow automation, and real-time data analysis. However, the prevailing cloud-centric deployment of AI carries a substantial environmental footprint due to high computational demands. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of agentic environments, a sustainability-oriented AI framework that extends beyond reactive systems by leveraging GenAI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce the environmental impact of technology. Agentic environments enable more efficient resource use, improved quality of life, and sustainability-by-design, while simultaneously enhancing data privacy through decentralized, edge-driven solutions. Drawing on secondary research as well as primary data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from leading technology companies, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for agentic environments examined through three lenses: the personal sphere, professional and commercial use, and urban operations. The findings highlight the potential of agentic environments to foster sustainable ecosystems through optimized resource utilization and strengthened data privacy. The study concludes with recommendations for edge-driven deployment models to reduce reliance on energy-intensive cloud infrastructures.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consensus approach for dimension reduction, combining multiple visualizations into a single robust representation to improve reliability and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimension reduction methods often yield differing results even for the same data, influenced by method choice and hyperparameters, making outputs inconsistent and less reliable.

Method: The authors apply multi-view learning to merge multiple dimension reduction outputs into a consensus visualization that highlights stable, shared data structures.

Result: The consensus visualization effectively identifies shared low-dimensional structures in both simulated and real-world datasets, showing consistency across various methods and hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: The proposed consensus visualization enhances the robustness and reproducibility of dimension reduction, supporting more trustworthy data analyses.

Abstract: A plethora of dimension reduction methods have been developed to visualize high-dimensional data in low dimensions. However, different dimension reduction methods often output different and possibly conflicting visualizations of the same data. This problem is further exacerbated by the choice of hyperparameters, which may substantially impact the resulting visualization. To obtain a more robust and trustworthy dimension reduction output, we advocate for a consensus approach, which summarizes multiple visualizations into a single consensus dimension reduction visualization. Here, we leverage ideas from multi-view learning in order to identify the patterns that are most stable or shared across the many different dimension reduction visualizations, or views, and subsequently visualize this shared structure in a single low-dimensional plot. We demonstrate that this consensus visualization effectively identifies and preserves the shared low-dimensional data structure through both simulated and real-world case studies. We further highlight our method's robustness to the choice of dimension reduction method and hyperparameters -- a highly-desirable property when working towards trustworthy and reproducible data science.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method combining k-means and the log-rank test to cluster survival curves without relying on computationally intensive bootstrap procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival curve clustering methods demand significant computational resources due to bootstrap resampling. Researchers need an efficient alternative for analyzing large survival datasets.

Method: The authors developed a clustering methodology using k-means combined with the log-rank test to bypass the computationally expensive resampling process inherent in conventional methods.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates comparable accuracy to bootstrap techniques through simulations while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The developed clustering approach offers a practical, scalable, and time-saving solution for analyzing survival curves in large-scale medical and epidemiological data.

Abstract: Survival analysis encompasses a broad range of methods for analyzing time-to-event data, with one key objective being the comparison of survival curves across groups. Traditional approaches for identifying clusters of survival curves often rely on computationally intensive bootstrap techniques to approximate the null hypothesis distribution. While effective, these methods impose significant computational burdens. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the k-means and log-rank test to efficiently identify and cluster survival curves. Our method eliminates the need for computationally expensive resampling, significantly reducing processing time while maintaining statistical reliability. By systematically evaluating survival curves and determining optimal clusters, the proposed method ensures a practical and scalable alternative for large-scale survival data analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves results comparable to existing bootstrap-based clustering methods while dramatically improving computational efficiency. These findings suggest that the log-rank-based clustering procedure offers a viable and time-efficient solution for researchers working with multiple survival curves in medical and epidemiological studies.

Motivation: To enhance understanding of dynamical systems and improve data-driven model discovery by leveraging principles of information analysis.

Method: The study uses the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) integrated with the SINDy framework, enabling visualization and prioritization of more informative data alongside spectral analysis and entropy metrics.

Result: The approach showcases improved sampling strategies and enhanced model performance across chaotic, non-chaotic systems, and various scenarios using Fisher Information and entropy-based metrics.

Conclusion: Information-based sampling strategies offer significant potential for learning efficiency and reducing data requirements in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.

Abstract: Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.

### [427] [Decision-Focused Bias Correction for Fluid Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15726)
*Can Er,Mo Liu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decision-corrected point estimate to improve decisions in two-stage stochastic optimization problems, avoiding biases of traditional fluid approximation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias introduced by using mean-based statistics in two-stage stochastic optimization problems, which can lead to suboptimal decisions.

Method: The authors propose identifying an alternative point statistic called the decision-corrected point estimate and develop an algorithm under general service network structures.

Result: Numerical experiments show that the decision-corrected point estimate improves decision-making compared to traditional fluid approximation methods.

Conclusion: Replacing mean-based estimates with decision-corrected point statistics leads to optimal decisions, particularly in service network problems with customer abandonment costs.

Abstract: Fluid approximation is a widely used approach for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems, with broad applications in service system design such as call centers and healthcare operations. However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation.

TL;DR: This paper addresses smart grid optimization through a complex system approach, combining game theory with classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address energy and pollution concerns by optimizing the evolving smart grid efficiently.

Method: The smart grid is modeled via a hybrid approach integrating game theory and classical methods across different levels for optimization.

Result: The proposed methodology improves flexibility, scalability, and generality in optimizing smart grid systems.

Conclusion: The combination of game theory and classical methods offers an effective framework for overcoming the challenges of global optimization in smart grids.

Abstract: Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.

*Ningwei Bai,Chi Pui Chan,Qichen Yin,Tengyang Gong,Yunda Yan,Zezhi Tang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a control system combining RL-driven controller, ESO for disturbance rejection, and ETM for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, disturbance-tolerant, and computationally light control systems in dynamic environments.

Method: A unified architecture integrating ESO for state/disturbance estimation, ADP method for policy approximation, and ETM to limit computation through event-triggering.

Result: Strong control performance with reduced computation and enhanced disturbance tolerance demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively balances control performance, disturbance rejection, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical insights into the PPO-Clip algorithm with deterministic actor-only optimization, focusing on RL with f-divergence regularization and establishing convergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous theoretical understanding of the PPO-Clip algorithm used in reinforcement learning for aligning large language models via RLHF.

Method: The paper analyzes deterministic actor-only PPO algorithms with softmax policy parameterization and f-divergence regularization, deriving conditions and inequalities related to convergence.

Result: The study establishes a linear convergence rate to optimal policy for forward KL-regularization, and stationary/local linear convergence for reverse KL-regularization.

Conclusion: The paper advances theoretical foundations of PPO algorithms and provides new insights into convergence behavior under KL-regularization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how momentum variance reduction (MVR) can enhance deep learning optimizers like Muon and Scion within the Gluon framework for improved optimization rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of deep learning optimizers, particularly for large language models, by integrating MVR into optimizers like Muon and Scion using the generalized Gluon framework.

Method: The authors integrate momentum variance reduction (MVR) into the Gluon framework, a general approach that encompasses Muon, Scion, and other LMO-based optimizers for neural network training.

Result: The incorporation of MVR led to improved convergence rates from ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$ in non-convex cases and demonstrates better performance via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating MVR into the Gluon framework leads to provable and practical improvements in optimization performance, establishing it as an effective method for deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent empirical research has demonstrated that deep learning optimizers based on the linear minimization oracle (LMO) over specifically chosen Non-Euclidean norm balls, such as Muon and Scion, outperform Adam-type methods in the training of large language models. In this work, we show that such optimizers can be provably improved by replacing their vanilla momentum by momentum variance reduction (MVR). Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks. In the non-convex case, we incorporate MVR into Gluon in three different ways. All of them improve the convergence rate from ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$. Additionally, we provide improved rates in the star-convex case. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments that verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of iteration complexity.

*Bahman Abolhassani,Tugba Erpek,Kemal Davaslioglu,Yalin E. Sagduyu,Sastry Kompella*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a MARL framework utilizing QMIX to safeguard robotic-swarm networks against reactive jammers by optimizing channel and power selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive jamming poses a critical threat to robotic-swarm networks, disrupting their communication and mission performance, and conventional countermeasures are insufficient against adaptive jamming strategies.

Method: The authors employ the MARL QMIX algorithm to train agents that coordinate transmit frequency and power selection to optimize network performance under jamming attacks, with decentralized execution enabled by a centralized but factorizable action-value function.

Result: The QMIX-based MARL approach shows faster convergence to efficient policies, achieving throughput near optimal bounds, reduced jamming interference, and superior performance to baseline methods in simulations.

Conclusion: MARL via QMIX effectively enhances swarm communication resilience in contested environments, showcasing its potential to combat adaptive jamming and secure autonomous networks.

Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.

Motivation: To address the privacy concerns associated with sharing raw spatial sensor data in cooperative vehicle perception, and advocate the adoption of data-sharing frameworks for robust scene understanding.

Method: The paper introduces SHARP, a research framework, designed to minimize privacy leakage in cooperative perception by implementing techniques that ensure ethical and secure data sharing.

Result: SHARP is presented as a potential solution to privacy issues in cooperative perception. It enables stakeholders to share raw data securely, balancing privacy needs and data usefulness.

Conclusion: SHARP represents a promising direction to mitigate privacy concerns, supporting the adoption of cooperative perception, but further research and collaboration among stakeholders are required.

Abstract: Cooperative perception between vehicles is poised to offer robust and reliable scene understanding. Recently, we are witnessing experimental systems research building testbeds that share raw spatial sensor data for cooperative perception. While there has been a marked improvement in accuracies and is the natural way forward, we take a moment to consider the problems with such an approach for eventual adoption by automakers. In this paper, we first argue that new forms of privacy concerns arise and discourage stakeholders to share raw sensor data. Next, we present SHARP, a research framework to minimize privacy leakage and drive stakeholders towards the ambitious goal of raw data based cooperative perception. Finally, we discuss open questions for networked systems, mobile computing, perception researchers, industry and government in realizing our proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for accurate and low-latency qubit measurements in trapped-ion quantum computing by exploring DNN integration on specific hardware platforms.

Method: The authors deploy MLP and ViT DNN models on FPGAs and GPUs to compare measurement performance, focusing on fidelity and latency. The FPGA solution integrates directly with EMCCD for reduced overhead.

Result: DNNs outperform conventional thresholding in reducing MMF errors by 1.8-2.5x for one qubit and 4.2-7.6x for three qubits. FPGA systems achieve nanosecond to microsecond inference latencies and 100x faster single-shot measurements than GPUs.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of FPGA-based DNN solutions for ultra-fast qubit detection, and future optimizations can further improve performance.

Abstract: Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.

TL;DR: The paper establishes non-linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI) for quantum hockey-stick divergence, improving upon existing linear and classical SDPI results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the characterization and performance of SDPI for quantum divergences, potentially improving the understanding of distinguishability contraction in quantum channels.

Method: The study introduces non-linear SDPI, defines generalized Dobrushin curves ($F_γ$) for quantum channels, and derives reverse-Pinsker inequalities with constraints on hockey-stick divergences.

Result: Non-linear SDPI provides tighter bounds on mixing times and stronger privacy guarantees for sequential quantum channels with local differential privacy.

Conclusion: Non-linear SDPI substantially improve upon linear counterparts, offering enhanced analysis for noisy quantum channels and their applications in privacy and mixing time settings.

Abstract: Data-processing is a desired property of classical and quantum divergences and information measures. In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_γ$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a neuromorphic system to emulate human-like working memory, addressing limitations in conventional artificial architectures such as high energy costs and noise sensitivity.

Method: The system uses intrinsic plasticity mechanisms implemented through the physical properties of MTJs to replicate biological memory volatility and enable near-sensor processing.

Result: Achieved 99.65% accuracy on gesture datasets, maintained high performance on novel benchmarks and driving tasks, reduced power consumption, and validated compact device design.

Conclusion: Replicating human-like working memory in a neuromorphic network offers significant performance improvements and energy savings, demonstrating the advantages of bio-inspired designs.

Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of Pb contamination in urban soil, which affects public health, food safety, and city greening, and to provide a less costly and labor-intensive Pb detection alternative.

Method: The method involves using radio frequencies to detect Pb contamination in soil, exploiting the effect of different salts on radio signal propagation. The approach includes controlled experiments with NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 and validating results with field samples and a machine learning model.

Result: SoilScanner achieved a 72% accuracy in classifying soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories and successfully avoided misclassifying samples with Pb > 500 ppm.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing economical and portable wireless devices to detect Pb in soil, paving the way for better environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.

Method: Developing a data-driven magnetic field model via PINN combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws, trained under diverse solar wind conditions.

Result: The model effectively reconstructs Mars' magnetospheric magnetic field's 3D configuration and reveals dependencies on solar wind parameters.

Conclusion: PINNs are shown to be highly capable tools for modeling complex magnetic field structures, advancing understanding of solar wind-Mars interactions.

Abstract: Understanding the magnetic field environment around Mars and its response to upstream solar wind conditions provide key insights into the processes driving atmospheric ion escape. To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and θ_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of trust management, deception, and robustness in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Method: Proposes a mechanism, Ev-Trust, built on evolutionary game theory, integrating trust aspects and guiding agents' behavior within a decentralized framework.

Result: Theoretical and experimental findings show Ev-Trust ensures trustworthiness, reduces malicious activity, and boosts collective revenue.

Conclusion: Ev-Trust offers a robust model for enabling trust in agentic service web settings and group evolutionary game scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.

The analysis identified three failure modes: overfitting to low-entropy time series, inherent survivor bias in high variance environments, and friction from lack of order-flow data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that adding model complexity without addressing information asymmetry increases systemic fragility, making such hybrid systems unreliable in real-world financial trading.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) is frequently hypothesized to be the "Holy Grail" of algorithmic trading, promising systems that adapt autonomously to non-stationary market regimes. This paper presents a rigorous post-mortem analysis of "Galaxy Empire," a hybrid framework coupling LSTM/Transformer-based perception with a genetic "Time-is-Life" survival mechanism. Deploying a population of 500 autonomous agents in a high-frequency cryptocurrency environment, we observed a catastrophic divergence between training metrics (Validation APY $>300\%$) and live performance (Capital Decay $>70\%$). We deconstruct this failure through a multi-disciplinary lens, identifying three critical failure modes: the overfitting of \textit{Aleatoric Uncertainty} in low-entropy time-series, the \textit{Survivor Bias} inherent in evolutionary selection under high variance, and the mathematical impossibility of overcoming microstructure friction without order-flow data. Our findings provide empirical evidence that increasing model complexity in the absence of information asymmetry exacerbates systemic fragility.

### [443] [DP-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Data Product Creation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15798)
*Faisal Chowdhury,Sola Shirai,Sarthak Dash,Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating automatic data product creation, leveraging ELT and Text-to-SQL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating automatic data product creation and improve methods for solving specific data-related problems.

Method: They developed DP-Bench using existing ELT and Text-to-SQL benchmarks and proposed LLM-based approaches as baselines.

Result: Created DP-Bench and demonstrated baseline approaches for automatic data product generation.

Conclusion: DP-Bench provides a standardized means to evaluate automatic data product creation and can enhance both research and industry practices.

Abstract: A data product is created with the intention of solving a specific problem, addressing a specific business usecase or meeting a particular need, going beyond just serving data as a raw asset. Data products enable end users to gain greater insights about their data. Since it was first introduced over a decade ago, there has been considerable work, especially in industry, to create data products manually or semi-automatically. However, there exists hardly any benchmark to evaluate automatic data product creation. In this work, we present a benchmark, first of its kind, for this task. We call it DP-Bench. We describe how this benchmark was created by taking advantage of existing work in ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) and Text-to-SQL benchmarks. We also propose a number of LLM based approaches that can be considered as baselines for generating data products automatically. We make the DP-Bench and supplementary materials available in https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibm-research/dp-bench .

### [444] [Scaling Text2SQL via LLM-efficient Schema Filtering with Functional Dependency Graph Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16083)
*Thanh Dat Hoang,Thanh Tam Nguyen,Thanh Trung Huynh,Hongzhi Yin,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient framework for schema filtering in Text2SQL systems, making LLM-based question answering scalable for large schemas by compacting prompts systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of current Text2SQL systems in handling real-world large schemas exceeding LLM context limits.

Method: The framework (	oolname) employs query-aware ranking of columns, reranking using a graph transformer on functional dependencies, and subschema selection using a Steiner-tree approach.

Result: Experiments show near-perfect recall, improved precision compared to existing methods, sub-second latency, and scalability to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

Conclusion: 	oolname enhances Text2SQL scalability and accuracy for large schemas, outperforming rivals while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Most modern Text2SQL systems prompt large language models (LLMs) with entire schemas -- mostly column information -- alongside the user's question. While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

### [445] [ModelTables: A Corpus of Tables about Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16106)
*Zhengyuan Dong,Victor Zhong,Renée J. Miller*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ModelTables benchmark provides a dataset of performance and configuration tables derived from sources like Hugging Face, GitHub, and papers, enabling advanced structured semantics retrieval methods for AI model metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to capture the structured semantics present in performance and configuration tables of AI models, often overlooked in text-based retrieval, facilitating improved organization and retrieval of such data.

Method: The authors built a benchmark dataset from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and papers, linking each table to its related model or publication. They also developed a multi-source ground truth using three signals: citation links, explicit model links, and shared datasets, and evaluated retrieval methods using this dataset.

Result: The study found that semantic retrieval models perform better than traditional data lake search operators, with dense table retrieval achieving the highest P@1 (66.5%). The benchmark results also demonstrate opportunities for developing more effective table searching techniques.

Conclusion: ModelTables serves as the first large-scale benchmark focused on structured AI model data. It underscores the need for advanced semantic retrieval methods and provides valuable resources for improving data organization and comparison in AI research.

Abstract: We present ModelTables, a benchmark of tables in Model Lakes that captures the structured semantics of performance and configuration tables often overlooked by text only retrieval. The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge. Source code, data, and other artifacts have been made available at https://github.com/RJMillerLab/ModelTables.

### [446] [Time-Frequency Analysis for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15992)
*Ahmed Abdeljawad,Elena Cordero*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper establishes a quantitative approximation theory for shallow neural networks by using tools from time-frequency analysis and modulation spaces, achieving dimension-independent Sobolev norm approximation rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the approximation capabilities of shallow neural networks, especially in Sobolev norms, by introducing time-frequency localized units and leveraging modulation spaces.

Method: The authors develop a framework based on weighted modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$ and prove approximation rates for neural networks in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,r}(Ω)$. This approach uses time-frequency windows and derives explicit dimension-independent bounds.

Result: The paper proves that for functions in $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$, the Sobolev norm error scales as $N^{-1/2}$ on bounded domains. It also extends the results to global approximation on $\mathbf{R}^{d}$ and validates the findings through numerical studies.

Conclusion: Modulation-based networks represent a significant theoretical and practical improvement over standard ReLU networks for Sobolev space approximations, supported by both theoretical derivations and numerical experiments.

Abstract: We develop a quantitative approximation theory for shallow neural networks using tools from time-frequency analysis. Working in weighted modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$, we prove dimension-independent approximation rates in Sobolev norms $W^{n,r}(Ω)$ for networks whose units combine standard activations with localized time-frequency windows. Our main result shows that for $f \in M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$ one can achieve \[ \|f - f_N\|_{W^{n,r}(Ω)} \lesssim N^{-1/2}\,\|f\|_{M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})}, \] on bounded domains, with explicit control of all constants. We further obtain global approximation theorems on $\mathbf{R}^{d}$ using weighted modulation dictionaries, and derive consequences for Feichtinger's algebra, Fourier-Lebesgue spaces, and Barron spaces. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions confirm that modulation-based networks achieve substantially better Sobolev approximation than standard ReLU networks, consistent with the theoretical estimates.

*Zemin Xu,Chenyu Wu,Wenbo Xie,Daiqian Xie,P. Hu*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cartesian-based models for atomistic machine learning, enabling comparisons with traditionally used spherical tensor models in predictive accuracy and theoretical foundation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether spherical tensor constructions are the only viable design principle and to assess the merits of Cartesian tensor formulations in atomistic machine learning.

Method: The authors define the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbols for combining irreducible Cartesian tensors, extend e3nn for Cartesian tensor operations, and release the Python package cartnn for implementing Cartesian counterparts of existing models like MACE, NequIP, and Allegro.

Result: This framework enables systematic comparisons between Cartesian and spherical models, providing insights into the performance and conceptual validity of Cartesian-based architectures.

Conclusion: Cartesian tensor formulations show promise under certain conditions, highlighting potential design improvements, and expanding the theoretical toolkit for atomistic machine learning models.

Abstract: Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.

### [448] [Interpretable Deep Learning for Stock Returns: A Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16251)
*Bong-Gyu Jang,Younwoo Jeong,Changeun Kim*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model (CB-APM), a neural network model to capture investor belief aggregation in asset pricing and predict risk premiums, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between belief aggregation processes and asset pricing by creating a partially interpretable model that captures how consensus-driven processes influence expected returns.

Method: The CB-APM uses a neural network to model the compression ('bottleneck') of dispersed investor beliefs into prices and links belief aggregation to return predictability and explanatory power.

Result: CB-APM improves long-horizon return forecasting accuracy, outperforms standard models, generates interpretable consensus-based insights, and demonstrates its predictions lead to meaningful economic payoffs.

Conclusion: CB-APM provides a valuable framework to combine predictive accuracy with interpretability, uncovering belief-driven structures in expected returns beyond traditional factor models.

Abstract: We introduce the \textit{Consensus-Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model} (CB-APM), a partially interpretable neural network that replicates the reasoning processes of sell-side analysts by capturing how dispersed investor beliefs are compressed into asset prices through a consensus formation process. By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics.
