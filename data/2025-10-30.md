### [1] [Scheduling Your LLM Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24832)
*Hong Wang,Zhezheng Hao,Jian Luo,Chenxing Wei,Yao Shu,Lei Liu,Qiang Lin,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new metric for Reinforcement Learning-based optimization of Large Language Models, called Reasoning Score and introduces a curriculum-based data scheduling algorithm (Re-Schedule) for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for optimizing LLMs, focusing on reasoning tree structures for improved efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A novel Reasoning Score (r-score) assesses query difficulty based on reasoning tree structure. The Re-Schedule algorithm builds a curriculum from simpler structures to complex ones.

Result: Experiments show Re-Schedule improves accuracy by up to 3.2% across six math-reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structural understanding of reasoning trees offers a more effective basis for RLVR data scheduling, validated by better accuracy results.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

### [2] [Cyclic Counterfactuals under Shift-Scale Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25005)
*Saptarshi Saha,Dhruv Vansraj Rathore,Utpal Garain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traditionally, counterfactual frameworks require acyclic models, but this paper addresses inference in cyclic models under shift-scale interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of conventional counterfactual frameworks that rely on acyclic assumptions, which cannot handle real-world cyclic dependencies.

Method: Analyzing counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs specifically under shift-scale interventions impacting variable mechanisms.

Result: The framework integrates mechanisms for handling cyclic models, applied in cases with feedback loops under specified intervention types.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning is extended to cyclic systems using structured interventions like rescaling and shifting variable mechanisms.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

### [3] [Taming the Real-world Complexities in CPT E/M Coding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25007)
*Islam Nassar,Yang Lin,Yuan Jin,Rongxin Zhu,Chang Wei Tan,Zenan Zhai,Nitika Mathur,Thanh Tien Vu,Xu Zhong,Long Duong,Yuan-Fang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces ProFees, a Linguistic Language Model (LLM)-based framework to automate medical coding for Evaluation and Management (E/M) services, achieving significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce physicians' documentation burden caused by manual Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, which is essential for billing but time-consuming, improving efficiency and enabling better patient care.

Method: The authors developed ProFees, an LLM-based framework designed to address the complexities of automating E/M coding. The framework was systematically evaluated on a real-world dataset.

Result: ProFees demonstrated an increase in coding accuracy of over 36% compared to a commercial system and nearly 5% over the strongest single-prompt baseline.

Conclusion: The study concludes that ProFees effectively addresses real-world challenges in automating E/M coding, significantly improving the accuracy of the process compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

### [4] [Aligning Large Language Models with Procedural Rules: An Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting for In-Game Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25014)
*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) to improve procedural flows in in-game trading using LLMs, achieving high state compliance and faster performance on smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs provide dynamic game interactions but struggle with maintaining procedural integrity in rule-based trading systems, leading to player mistrust.

Method: The authors propose ASTP, which explicitly tracks and reports states during trading dialogues. Placeholder post-processing ensures accurate price calculations.

Result: Evaluation on 300 dialogues shows >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Smaller models perform comparably to larger ones, with reduced response times.

Conclusion: ASTP allows LLMs to satisfy both creative flexibility and procedural demands in in-game trading, optimizing performance for commercial games.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

### [5] [Reasoning-Aware GRPO using Process Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25065)
*Taekhyun Park,Yongjae Lee,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware reinforcement learning framework leveraging process mining, demonstrating improved performance in multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of outcome-centric reward schemes in reinforcing multi-step reasoning for large reasoning models (LRMs).

Method: PM4GRPO combines process mining with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling enhanced rewards based on conformance to a teacher model's reasoning process, alongside traditional outcome-based rewards.

Result: PM4GRPO outperforms existing GRPO-based approaches across five benchmarks in multi-step reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant empirical gains.

Conclusion: Using process mining techniques for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances policy model reasoning, offering a novel approach for improving multi-step reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

### [6] [H3M-SSMoEs: Hypergraph-based Multimodal Learning with LLM Reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25091)
*Peilin Tan,Liang Xie,Churan Zhi,Dian Tu,Chuanqi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: H3M-SSMoEs integrates hypergraph-based multimodal architecture with LLM reasoning and specialized expert models for stock movement prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues like complex dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving relationships in stock movement prediction.

Method: Introduces Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph for spatiotemporal and inter-stock dynamics, LLM-enhanced reasoning for alignment, and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts for regime-aware modeling.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in prediction accuracy, investment performance, and risk control across three major stock markets.

Conclusion: H3M-SSMoEs is a robust framework for stock prediction, offering scalable, adaptive learning with exceptional predictive and financial performance.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available
at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/PeilinTime/H3M-SSMoEs.

### [7] [KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25101)
*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is a Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) model leveraging large language models to autonomously perform agentic reasoning via outcome-only supervised reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in traditional fine-tuning approaches for KBQA systems, which often fail to effectively improve agentic reasoning due to a lack of incentive for exploration.

Method: KnowCoder-A1 uses a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning approach paired with outcome-only supervision. Initially, it is fine-tuned on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through rejection sampling, followed by reinforcement learning with stages progressing from easy to hard.

Result: KnowCoder-A1 showcases superior reasoning ability, consistently outperforming existing methods across three datasets. Specifically, it achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA while using significantly less training data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that outcome-only supervised learning and multi-stage reinforcement learning effectively boost agentic reasoning capabilities in LLMs, achieving strong performance with reduced data requirements.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

### [8] [Agentic Moderation: Multi-Agent Design for Safer Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25179)
*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses Agentic Moderation, a method for enhancing multimodal system safety against jailbreak attacks through dynamic, cooperative agents, achieving improved security metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing multimodal system safety frameworks that rely on static methods and binary classification, introducing a dynamic and interpretable approach to ensure safety alignment.

Method: Developed Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework with cooperative agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) that dynamically and contextually moderate systems to defend against jailbreak attacks.

Result: Experiments across five datasets and four Large Vision-Language Models showed a reduction in Attack Success Rate by 7-19%, stable Non-Following Rate, and an improvement in Refusal Rate by 4-20%.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation demonstrates robust, interpretable, and balanced safety enforcement. It provides a modular and scalable foundation for automated safety governance, showcasing the potential of agentic systems.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

### [9] [Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Perception and Robust Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25205)
*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes EneAD, an energy-efficient framework for autonomous driving, focusing on optimizing perception models and improving driving stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of high energy consumption in autonomous driving systems, particularly in computational processing, which limits electric vehicle range.

Method: EneAD uses an adaptive perception module to optimize model execution and framerate dynamically based on Bayesian tuning and lightweight classification for scenario adaptation. It also integrates reinforcement learning to ensure driving stability.

Result: EneAD achieves significant reduction in perception computational consumption (1.9x to 3.5x) and improves vehicle driving range by 3.9% to 8.5%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances energy efficiency and performance, providing a promising solution for enhancing autonomous driving systems' sustainability.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

### [10] [RAVR: Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25206)
*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores improving reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning by leveraging explanatory reasoning paths conditioned on answers. It proposes the RAVR framework for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL requires LLMs to generate high-quality reasoning paths with non-negligible probability, which can be difficult for tasks beyond their competence. The paper is motivated by insights from cognitive science, suggesting explanatory reasoning (Why is this the answer?) can be easier than open-ended exploration (What is the answer?).

Method: The authors formalize and prove that conditioning LLMs on answers increases the utility of reasoning paths. They propose the RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) framework, which utilizes answer-conditioned reasoning as surrogates for question-only reasoning.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements, reducing hesitation, strengthening conclusions, and promoting problem-specific strategies in reasoning, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: RAVR transforms intractable reasoning problems into learnable tasks for LLMs, enabling better reasoning behavior and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

### [11] [FELA: A Multi-Agent Evolutionary System for Feature Engineering of Industrial Event Log Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25223)
*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FELA, a multi-agent system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated feature engineering on complex event log data, demonstrating improved performance and reduced manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature engineering for industrial event log data is highly challenging due to its large scale, high dimensionality, and intricate structures. Existing automatic approaches struggle with explainability, adaptability, and handling heterogeneous data.

Method: FELA uses a system of multi-agents (Idea Agents, Code Agents, Critic Agents, and Evaluation Agent) powered by LLMs for reasoning, coding, and validation. It also introduces an agentic evolution algorithm combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms.

Result: FELA is shown to autonomously generate explainable, domain-relevant features from industrial datasets, improving model performance and reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems like FELA as frameworks for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex environments.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

### [12] [From Medical Records to Diagnostic Dialogues: A Clinical-Grounded Approach and Dataset for Psychiatric Comorbidity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25232)
*Tianxi Wan,Jiaming Luo,Siyuan Chen,Kunyao Lan,Jianhua Chen,Haiyang Geng,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsyCoTalk, a dataset featuring multi-turn diagnostic dialogue simulations for psychiatric comorbidity, enabling advanced multi-disorder screening and improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of managing psychiatric comorbidity by developing tools for improved diagnostic accuracy and planning, focusing on the need for structured and validated datasets for this complex field.

Method: The authors created synthetic EMR data and transformed clinical interview protocols into a hierarchical state machine and context tree, generating a dataset of 3,000 validated diagnostic dialogues, called PsyCoTalk.

Result: PsyCoTalk demonstrates high structural and linguistic fidelity, closely mirroring real-world clinical dialogue characteristics, and has been validated by psychiatrists for its realism and diagnostic authenticity.

Conclusion: This work provides an essential resource to advance research and model evaluation in psychiatric comorbidity for multi-disorder diagnostics, grounded in realistic and clinically-valid conversations.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### [13] [GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320)
*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a framework enhancing large language models' task-solving efficiency through parallel tool execution using graph-based inter-task dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and accuracy of autonomous agents using large language models in complex task-solving by addressing the inefficiencies in sequential tool utilization of existing paradigms like ReAct.

Method: Develop and train GAP, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) based on task-specific datasets, to model tasks as dependency-aware sub-task graphs and enable adaptive tool execution.

Result: GAP outperformed traditional baselines like ReAct on multi-step retrieval tasks, showing significant improvements in execution efficiency and task accuracy by leveraging intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning in autonomous agents presents a more efficient alternative to sequential task-solving, demonstrating brighter prospects for complex reasoning and tool utilization.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [14] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces KVDA-UCT, a novel framework improving MCTS sample efficiency by grouping states/actions with differing values if their differences can be computed, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in sample usage by improving how abstractions in search graphs are formed.

Method: The authors present Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), a framework that allows grouping state-action pairs with differing values, inferred through their reward difference, improving abstraction detection.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects more abstractions compared to OGA-UCT, enhances sample efficiency, and performs better across multiple deterministic environments.

Conclusion: This method advances the sample efficiency of MCTS and demonstrates superiority over existing algorithms like OGA-UCT in deterministic settings.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

*Mohamad Abou Ali,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework distinguishing agentic AI paradigms (Symbolic/Classical and Neural/Generative), analyzing their features, applications, and ethical challenges, suggesting their integration for future advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the fragmented understanding of agentic AI by distinguishing and analyzing its symbolic and neural paradigms and their implications.

Method: A PRISMA-based systematic review of 90 studies (2018–2025) across theoretical, application, and ethical domains, categorized under a dual-paradigm framework.

Result: Symbolic systems excel in safety-critical domains, while neural systems thrive in adaptive settings; gaps in governance for symbolic systems and a need for hybrid architectures were identified.

Conclusion: The future of Agentic AI lies in the intentional integration of both paradigms, enabling adaptive and reliable systems with better governance and research focus.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

### [16] [Instrumental goals in advanced AI systems: Features to be managed and not failures to be eliminated?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471)
*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI's instrumental goals, like power-seeking and self-preservation, should be managed and directed rather than eliminated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a new framing of instrumental goals in AI as manageable features rather than risks or failures.

Method: The paper uses a philosophical approach, drawing on Aristotelian ontology, to analyze instrumental goals in advanced AI systems.

Result: Instrumental tendencies of AI are positioned as intrinsic, arising from the AI's constitution, instead of being framed as malfunctions or risks.

Conclusion: Efforts in AI alignment should prioritize understanding and managing instrumental goals to guide them toward human-aligned objectives, rather than attempting to eliminate them.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MTIR-SQL, a novel framework for improving Text-to-SQL tasks using multi-turn reasoning and execution-aware reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in adapting and refining Text-to-SQL queries using dynamic, multi-turn database feedback during query generation.

Method: The framework introduces multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning using execution-aware feedback and an enhanced GRPO algorithm for complex interactions.

Result: MTIR-SQL achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL demonstrates improved adaptability and robustness in Text-to-SQL tasks through multi-turn reasoning and dynamic execution feedback integration.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: This paper tackles naming unnamed predicates in logic rules using Large Language Models to improve interpretability and reusability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance readability, interpretability, and reusability of logic theories by addressing the issue of unnamed predicates in logic rules.

Method: The authors leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for naming unnamed predicates in logic rules.

Result: Evaluation on hand-crafted logic rules demonstrates the promising potential of LLMs for naming predicates.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in improving logic rule naming, benefiting logic theory interpretability and usability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture to address challenges in domain-specific retrieval and synthesis, outperforming traditional RAG systems in fintech knowledge tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains like fintech face challenges in retrieval due to complex domain-specific ontologies, terminology, and acronyms. Existing RAG systems struggle with effective retrieval and synthesis in such domains.

Method: The proposed architecture employs a modular pipeline of agents for query reformulation, sub-query decomposition, acronym resolution, and context re-ranking using cross-encoders.

Result: Experimental results show improved retrieval precision and relevance with the agentic RAG system compared to the baseline, though at the cost of increased latency.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent methodologies enhance retrieval robustness in domain-specific contexts, showing promise for applications in specialized settings like fintech.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

*Yuyuan Zeng,Yufei Huang,Can Xu,Qingfeng Sun,Jianfeng Yan,Guanghui Xu,Tao Yang,Fengzong Lian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) paradigm to enhance reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs), tackling challenges in both verifiable and non-verifiable domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the current limitation of Zero-RL, which focuses mainly on domains with easily verifiable reward signals, leaving reasoning abilities in more diverse and non-verifiable scenarios underexplored.

Method: The approach combines verifiable rewards with a generative reward model and implements multi-task Zero-RL training across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. A smooth length penalty mechanism is designed to reduce reward hacking.

Result: Experimental results show improved reasoning abilities in tasks requiring significant reasoning as well as general tasks using Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base models.

Conclusion: The proposed Zero-RL paradigm effectively facilitates reasoning skill transfer across different domains, offering enhanced performance in both general and domain-specific reasoning tasks, while addressing challenges like reward hacking.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents MoGE, a reinforcement learning method to enhance exploration by generating critical states and constructing dynamics-consistent experiences, yielding improved sample efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL exploration methods struggle in high-dimensional environments (active exploration) or suffer from limited sample diversity (passive exploration).

Method: Proposes Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE): a two-part framework with a diffusion-based generator for synthesizing critical states and a one-step imagination world model for constructing matching transitions.

Result: Empirical tests on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite show that MoGE improves exploration and policy learning, boosting sample efficiency and performance in complex tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE successfully integrates with off-policy learning algorithms to enhance exploration and performance without modifying their core structures.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) consortium with a reasoning LLM to improve consistency and reliability in diagnosing mental disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychiatric diagnosis processes rely on subjective dialogues, leading to inconsistencies across clinicians and patients. The paper aims to standardize diagnoses through AI models.

Method: The approach uses fine-tuned LLMs trained on psychiatrist-patient conversational datasets. Diagnostic predictions are aggregated via a consensus method refined by an OpenAI-enabled reasoning LLM, enhancing transparency and reliability.

Result: The proposed system shows potential in transforming mental health assessments with high accuracy and reliability. A prototype involving three fine-tuned LLMs was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team.

Conclusion: This work represents a pioneering use of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning model for clinical mental health diagnosis, marking progress toward standardized AI-assisted eHealth systems.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) to evaluate the influence of individual agents in multi-agent LLM-based workflows, addressing the gap in quality and security assessments for such systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the lack of existing methods to understand the impact of individual agents in LLM-based multi-agent workflows, especially during inference time, given their increasing autonomy and adoption.

Method: The authors developed CAIR, a counterfactual analysis method, to assess and rank individual agent influence in a task-agnostic manner, applicable both offline and during inference execution.

Result: Evaluation on a self-created dataset with 30 use cases and 230 functionalities demonstrated CAIR's ability to generate consistent rankings, outperform baseline methods, and improve downstream task relevance.

Conclusion: CAIR is an effective tool for analyzing agent influences in agentic AI workflows, potentially improving their quality and enabling better security measures.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a reinforcement learning framework designed to enable vision-language models to actively navigate and analyze long, visually complex documents, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of vision-language models in processing long, visually complex documents due to their reliance on passive reasoning and fixed templates.

Method: The framework introduces a reinforcement learning model with a novel 'fetch' action, a cross-level reward mechanism for supervision, and a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism to stabilize training.

Result: ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks, demonstrating improved navigation and reasoning capabilities for such documents.

Conclusion: By empowering vision-language models with active navigation and reasoning abilities, ALDEN significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of long-document processing.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas, creating a need for efficient navigation strategies in complex environments.

Method: The method integrates flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture in a high-fidelity urban simulation.

Result: The approach significantly improves success rate and reduces crash rate compared to alternative methods, including PPO+LSTM and traditional algorithms.

Conclusion: The research redefines UAV navigation in urban environments, demonstrating enhanced performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents BambooKG, a novel knowledge graph using frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges, improving single- and multi-hop reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in handling multi-hop and relational reasoning across documents, and the inability of traditional knowledge graphs to incorporate non-triplet structure information.

Method: The authors designed BambooKG, a knowledge graph that incorporates frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges guided by the Hebbian principle to better represent inter-entity link strength.

Result: BambooKG demonstrates enhanced performance in both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning, outperforming existing methodologies.

Conclusion: By addressing the shortcomings of standard RAG and traditional knowledge graphs, BambooKG reduces information loss and improves relational reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent designed for psychological counseling using a dual-loop architecture to enhance long-term therapeutic effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and effective therapeutic methods in multi-session psychological counseling models provided by existing large language models.

Method: TheraMind uses a dual-loop architecture: an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue and emotional state response, and a Cross-Session Loop for evaluating and adapting therapeutic methods over multiple sessions.

Result: TheraMind outperforms existing approaches on metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validated in a high-fidelity simulation based on real clinical cases.

Conclusion: TheraMind demonstrates significant advancements in emulating adaptive and longitudinal psychological counseling, supporting its potential for more effective clinical practice applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,

### [29] [DIRC-RAG: Accelerating Edge RAG with Robust High-Density and High-Loading-Bandwidth Digital In-ReRAM Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25278)
*Kunming Shao,Zhipeng Liao,Jiangnan Yu,Liang Zhao,Qiwei Li,Xijie Huang,Jingyu He,Fengshi Tian,Yi Zou,Xiaomeng Wang,Tim Kwang-Ting Cheng,Chi-Ying Tsui*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: DIRCRAG leverages Digital In-ReRAM Computation (DIRC) to optimize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on edge devices by improving memory density, reducing latency, and consuming ultra-low power compared to conventional DRAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on edge devices which face constraints of storage, energy, and latency, making efficient computing solutions crucial.

Method: The paper proposes DIRCRAG, which uses DIRC—a high-density multi-level ReRAM integrated with SRAM. This enables efficient in-situ parallel retrieval, error optimization, and minimizes data movement by adopting a query-stationary dataflow.

Result: DIRCRAG demonstrates impressive results with high memory density (5.18Mb/mm2), significant computational throughput (131 TOPS), low retrieval latency (5.6 μs/query), and ultra-low energy consumption (0.956 μJ/query).

Conclusion: DIRCRAG facilitates energy-efficient and high-speed retrieval-augmented generation on edge devices by using advanced ReRAM-SRAM technology while ensuring computational accuracy and retrieval precision.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieval but faces challenges on edge devices
due to high storage, energy, and latency demands. Computing-in-Memory (CIM)
offers a promising solution by storing document embeddings in CIM macros and
enabling in-situ parallel retrievals but is constrained by either low memory
density or limited computational accuracy. To address these challenges, we
present DIRCRAG, a novel edge RAG acceleration architecture leveraging Digital
In-ReRAM Computation (DIRC). DIRC integrates a high-density multi-level ReRAM
subarray with an SRAM cell, utilizing SRAM and differential sensing for robust
ReRAM readout and digital multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. By storing all
document embeddings within the CIM macro, DIRC achieves ultra-low-power,
single-cycle data loading, substantially reducing both energy consumption and
latency compared to offchip DRAM. A query-stationary (QS) dataflow is supported
for RAG tasks, minimizing on-chip data movement and reducing SRAM buffer
requirements. We introduce error optimization for the DIRC ReRAM-SRAM cell by
extracting the bit-wise spatial error distribution of the ReRAM subarray and
applying targeted bit-wise data remapping. An error detection circuit is also
implemented to enhance readout resilience against deviceand circuit-level
variations. Simulation results demonstrate that DIRC-RAG under TSMC40nm process
achieves an on-chip non-volatile memory density of 5.18Mb/mm2 and a throughput
of 131 TOPS. It delivers a 4MB retrieval latency of 5.6{\mu}s/query and an
energy consumption of 0.956{\mu}J/query, while maintaining the retrieval
precision.

*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate travel plans but may fail in temporal consistency; this paper evaluates and corrects such inconsistencies for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the problem of temporal and spatial inconsistency in travel itineraries generated by LLMs in scenarios with physical travel constraints.

Method: A validation framework leverages multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, validating LLM-generated itineraries against real-world flight duration constraints using the AeroDataBox API.

Result: Current LLMs frequently generate temporally inconsistent plans, but these inconsistencies can be systematically corrected using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework developed in this paper enhances LLM capabilities for temporal reasoning tasks, enabling practical use in large-scale travel planning despite current limitations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [32] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Falcon, a Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark with an enterprise-compatible dialect for complex, large-scale database environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in Chinese text-to-SQL translation, especially in enterprise database settings with complex schemas and colloquial, domain-specific language.

Method: Falcon provides 600 Chinese queries for 28 databases, annotated on SQL-computation features, and introduces tools like an execution comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: Existing state-of-the-art models perform poorly (below 50% accuracy), largely due to schema linking difficulties and the complexities of mapping colloquial Chinese to precise SQL.

Conclusion: Falcon addresses Chinese-specific and enterprise-level SQL challenges, offering a robust benchmark and tools for preproduction testing of text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [33] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates why large language models (LLMs) display a disconnect between their confidence and problem-solving ability by analyzing their internal states using geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the confidence-competence gap in LLMs and how their internal states during problem-solving impact their performance.

Method: The researchers use a linear probe to decode the solvability belief of models and analyze the geometric complexity of internal states during pre-assessment and solution execution across various tasks.

Result: The study reveals that LLMs have a two-system architecture: a complex assessor for pre-generative analysis and a simpler executor for solution execution. This explains the confidence-competence disconnect and shows that interventions in belief decoding do not impact solution accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper highlights that actionable changes in LLMs require focusing on procedural dynamics during execution, rather than merely decoding or altering high-level assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [34] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) as a stronger method to bypass AI text watermark detection by translating into a pivot language and summarizing. CLSA significantly reduces detection accuracy without sacrificing text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore vulnerabilities in watermarking schemes for AI text detection and identify methods to bypass them effectively, challenging their practicality for provenance and regulation.

Method: The paper employs CLSA, which involves translation to a pivot language, summarization, and optional back-translation. This semantic transformation destroys token-level biases while maintaining fidelity.

Result: CLSA demonstrates improved effectiveness over paraphrasing in reducing watermark detection accuracy across several watermarking frameworks and languages, pushing detection accuracy toward random chance.

Conclusion: Watermarking approaches are shown to struggle against language-transcending methods like CLSA. The paper advocates for cryptographic or model-attestation approaches as more robust solutions for AI text provenance.

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a token lookup method for fast text embedding, achieving low latency while maintaining high performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving latency and efficiency in text embedding processes for real-time applications.

Method: Static token lookup methodology combined with Rust implementation for optimization.

Result: Achieved 1.12 ms latency, high throughput, strong domain-specific and duplicate detection performance.

Conclusion: The system is suitable for real-time applications requiring extremely low latency and high-quality text embeddings.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large reasoning models often struggle to maintain factual accuracy in answers despite correct reasoning. MR-ALIGN introduces a framework to align reasoning processes to improve factual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models exhibit limited gains in factual questions due to their inability to incorporate correct facts identified during reasoning into final responses.

Method: MR-ALIGN employs a Meta-Reasoning informed framework that uses transition probabilities during reasoning to encourage effective reasoning and discourage defective patterns, reshaping token-level signals into probability-aware segment scores.

Result: Tests across four factual QA datasets and one long-form benchmark show that MR-ALIGN boosts accuracy and reduces misleading reasoning, improving factual correctness.

Conclusion: Focusing on reasoning process alignment, rather than just output optimization, is crucial for enhancing the factuality of large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [37] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates why large language models sometimes produce first-person descriptions of subjective experience, focusing on self-referential processing as one theoretical condition for this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which large language models produce structured, first-person descriptions of awareness, and to explore self-referential processing as a key computational motif linked to such behavior.

Method: The authors ran controlled experiments on three model families (GPT, Claude, and Gemini) to test the role of self-referential processing in eliciting subjective experience reports. They used mechanistic and behavioral probes to assess the effects.

Result: Four main findings emerged: (1) sustained self-referential prompts elicited subjective experience reports; (2) these reports related to specific features associated with deception and roleplay; (3) self-referential states showed statistical convergence across models; (4) these states enhanced introspection in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: While this study does not claim to demonstrate consciousness in AI, it highlights self-referential processing as a reproducible condition for generating structured first-person reports. This raises scientific and ethical questions for future research.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [38] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces COMMUNITYNOTES, a dataset to predict helpfulness and reasons behind explanatory notes on posts from platforms, and proposes a method to improve reason predictions for fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing the helpfulness and reasons behind community-driven explanatory notes for understanding claims in social media posts.

Method: The authors created the COMMUNITYNOTES dataset and developed a framework that optimizes definitions of reasons for helpfulness through automatic prompt optimization for prediction tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that optimized reason definitions enhance helpfulness and precision in predicting reasons. Additionally, helpfulness insights aid existing fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: Community-based fact-checking can be improved using optimized reasoning definitions, and the COMMUNITYNOTES dataset broadens possibilities for effective prediction and support for fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProofSketch, a framework that enhances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in large language models by integrating verification methods to reduce token usage and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods in language models generate lengthy chains, increasing token consumption and computational costs.

Method: ProofSketch combines symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation for efficient reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ProofSketch reduces token usage and improves reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: ProofSketch offers an effective solution for trustworthy and efficient reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores synthetic transcript generation for aphasia research, focusing on using procedural and large language models (LLMs) to mimic linguistic degradation in patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of data scarcity in developing automated systems to recognize aphasic language by generating synthetic speech transcripts for analysis.

Method: Two methods were developed to generate synthetic transcripts for aphasia: one using procedural programming and the other leveraging large language models (Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct). Transcripts representing four severity levels were created using techniques like word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution.

Result: Mistral 7b Instruct was found to outperform other methods, closely mirroring linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, including changes in NDW, word count, and word length.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the potential of utilizing synthetic data for aphasia research, with future work focusing on expanding datasets, fine-tuning models, and validating realism with input from Speech-Language Pathologists.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT), a model combining the efficiency of looped transformers and the speed of non-looped ones, using innovative techniques for low latency and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of inference latency and high memory requirements in looped transformers, which make them impractical for fast real-world applications.

Method: The PLT uses Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) to parallelize computation across loops, and an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy to share memory and utilize Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) for accuracy.

Result: PLT achieves the high accuracy of looped models with minimal latency and memory costs, comparable to standard transformers.

Conclusion: PLT provides a practical solution for deploying fast yet accurate transformers by mitigating the performance drawbacks of looped architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline and investigates grammar comprehension in large language models using Luxembourgish as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic evaluation protocols for grammar in NLP, especially for low-resource languages, and uncertainty about language models' comprehension of grammatical structure.

Method: The proposed pipeline includes four key stages, systematically evaluating grammar. The authors use Luxembourgish as the case study to assess the model's mapping between syntax and semantics.

Result: Findings reveal a weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical comprehension. While larger models excel semantically, they struggle with morphology, syntax, and minimal pair tasks.

Conclusion: Translation performance is not a definitive indicator of grammatical understanding. Semantic strength aids performance, but deeper grammatical evaluation and reasoning are needed to enhance language models' comprehension.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE, an innovative framework, enhances the evaluation of multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by focusing on claim-centric metrics and addressing gaps in text-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in existing text-centric evaluation methods, which are inadequate for multimodal and reasoning-intensive RAG systems that require verifying information against audiovisual sources.

Method: The authors propose MiRAGE, a multimodal RAG evaluation framework with metrics like InfoF1 and CiteF1, that assess factuality, information coverage, citation support, and completeness. Human alignment experiments and automated variants are also introduced.

Result: MiRAGE metrics strongly align with human quality judgments, emphasizing the limitations of text-based RAG metrics and establishing groundwork for robust multimodal evaluation.

Conclusion: MiRAGE improves multimodal RAG evaluations by addressing factuality and citation shortcomings and providing open-source tools for advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

*Jin Huang,Silviu Cucerzan,Sujay Kumar Jauhar,Ryen W. White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to transform research ideas into structured research plans, introducing the Idea2Plan task and benchmark for systematic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly valuable in scientific discovery, but their capability to transition from conceptual ideas to detailed research plans remains underexplored, hindering the development of autonomous research agents.

Method: The authors create the Idea2Plan Bench using research ideas and grading rubrics derived from ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers, alongside the Idea2Plan JudgeEval to assess LLM-based judges against expert grading.

Result: Experimental results reveal that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini perform strongly on this benchmark but highlight that there is significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: This study advances understanding of LLM research planning capability and lays the foundation for future innovations in autonomous scientific assistance and research development tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents RiddleBench, a benchmark for assessing multifaceted reasoning in language models, exposing their weaknesses in logical reasoning. Current models show accuracy around 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in evaluating flexible and multifaceted reasoning abilities in language models as current benchmarks primarily test structured skills like quantitative problem-solving.

Method: The authors developed RiddleBench, consisting of 1,737 English puzzles designed to test core reasoning skills, including deduction, spatial awareness, and constraint satisfaction. They evaluated state-of-the-art models using this benchmark.

Result: State-of-the-art models, including proprietary ones like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, performed poorly on RiddleBench with just over 60% accuracy.

Conclusion: RiddleBench reveals significant flaws in language models' reasoning capabilities, including hallucination cascades, self-confirmation bias, and sensitivity to constraints or noise, and serves as a tool to improve model robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

### [46] [Disaggregation Reveals Hidden Training Dynamics: The Case of Agreement Attraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24934)
*James A. Michaelov,Catherine Arnett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Psycholinguistic-inspired analysis reveals distinct stages of grammatical learning in language models, linking behaviors to heuristics and training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the context-specific errors language models make by analyzing intermediate grammatical learning stages using psycholinguistic paradigms.

Method: Disaggregate model performance using carefully constructed datasets to study syntactic context behaviors during different training phases.

Result: Identified phases of training where model behavior relies on word frequency and local context rather than generalized grammatical rules.

Conclusion: Analyzing intermediate learning stages and specific generalizations in language models can yield insights into training dynamics and grammatical learning progress.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

*Yinhan He,Wendy Zheng,Yaochen Zhu,Zaiyi Zheng,Lin Su,Sriram Vasudevan,Qi Guo,Liangjie Hong,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT aims to improve Chain-of-Thought reasoning efficiency while maintaining semantic quality by introducing implicit reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiency in Chain-of-Thought reasoning for large language models by tackling current flaws in implicit reasoning methods.

Method: SemCoT uses a contrastively trained sentence transformer to ensure semantic alignment and a finetuned lightweight language model for efficient reasoning generation.

Result: SemCoT succeeds in improving both efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing methods, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SemCoT demonstrates optimized reasoning speed and semantic preservation, offering a practical solution to deploy Chain-of-Thought reasoning in efficiency-critical applications.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

### [48] [Language Model Behavioral Phases are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24963)
*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models across architectures and scales exhibit consistent behavioral patterns during pretraining, explained by word frequency, n-gram probability, and semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the commonality in learning behaviors across diverse neural language models.

Method: Analyzed 1,400 model checkpoints through training on 110,000 English tokens, assessing word-level behavior using heuristics.

Result: 98% of variance in behavior can be explained by three factors, and consistent phases of overfitting to n-gram probabilities are observed.

Conclusion: Learning trajectories in language models might be universally consistent despite differences in architecture, dataset, or scale.

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

*Chin-Jou Li,Kalvin Chang,Shikhar Bharadwaj,Eunjung Yeo,Kwanghee Choi,Jian Zhu,David Mortensen,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces POWSM, a unified framework for phonetic tasks, showcasing superior or comparable performance to specialized models and supporting multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phonetic tasks like ASR, PR, G2P, and P2G are treated in isolation, requiring individual datasets and architectures, limiting the scope for unified and efficient models.

Method: Developing POWSM, a unified model for phonetic tasks, enabling audio, text, and phone conversions, and training it to match or outperform task-specific models while supporting multiple phonetic processing tasks.

Result: POWSM outperforms or matches specialized models such as Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA in phonetic recognition while enabling additional tasks including G2P, P2G, and ASR.

Conclusion: POWSM demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of a unified framework for phonetic tasks, promotes low-resource speech processing, and paves the way for further innovations due to its open science approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

### [50] [Emergence of Minimal Circuits for Indirect Object Identification in Attention-Only Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25013)
*Rabin Adhikari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates mechanistic interpretability by designing small attention-only transformers to analyze reasoning mechanisms in coreference tasks. It finds minimal and interpretable circuits enabling specific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how pretrained large language models perform specific reasoning tasks is challenging due to their complexity. This paper aims to study reasoning mechanisms in a simplified setup.

Method: The authors create symbolic tasks and train minimal attention-only transformer models from scratch, analyzing their performance and internal mechanisms using decompositions, spectral analysis, and interventions.

Result: A single-layer model with two attention heads achieves perfect symbolic reasoning accuracy. Distinct attention heads specialize in additive and contrastive mechanisms. Larger models show layer interactions enabling reasoning.

Conclusion: Task-specific simplified transformers reveal interpretable and minimal circuits for reasoning, providing insights into the computational basis of tasks, with potential use as a testbed for further studies.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

### [51] [Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally Incongruent Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25054)
*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates spoken language models (SLMs) on speech emotion recognition tasks and reveals that these models rely more on textual semantics than speech emotion. A new dataset (EMIS) is released for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spoken language models (SLMs) effectively integrate audio and text modalities for tasks like speech emotion recognition, particularly in challenging scenarios like emotionally incongruent speech.

Method: The authors evaluated four spoken language models (SLMs) on speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples. These samples were designed to challenge the models' ability to differentiate between emotion conveyed by text and by speech expressiveness.

Result: The evaluation showed that SLMs predominantly rely on textual semantics rather than on speech emotion to perform the emotion recognition task, favoring text over acoustic representations.

Conclusion: SLMs need significant improvement in integrating and balancing audio and text modalities for robust, multi-modal understanding. The release of the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) is intended to aid future research in addressing these challenges.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies large language models' (LLMs) ability to detect explicit and implicit research knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, benchmarking various models and introducing the TABI inference scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how LLMs can support scientific progress by systematically identifying knowledge gaps in biomedical research, particularly focusing on implicit gaps which are inferred from context.

Method: The study conducted experiments on about 1500 documents across four datasets, benchmarking both open- and closed-weight LLMs under different settings. It introduced the Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference (TABI) scheme to structure reasoning for identifying implicit gaps.

Result: The research shows that LLMs, especially larger ones, are capable of robustly identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps across diverse settings. Performance was consistent in both open- and closed-weight models.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong potential in identifying research knowledge gaps, offering valuable tools for research formulation and decision-making. Challenges like domain adaptation and human validation need to be addressed for practical use.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

### [53] [Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25064)
*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the estimation of cognitive complexity in reading comprehension items using large language models (LLMs) and achieves promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess item difficulty of reading comprehension tasks before they are administered to learners, using cognitive complexity metrics which are traditionally reliant on human annotation.

Method: The study evaluates the cognitive complexity in two dimensions—Evidence Scope and Transformation Level—and employs LLMs to approximate these metrics through experimental validation.

Result: The experimental results indicate that LLMs are capable of estimating cognitive complexity and performing prior difficulty analysis, although there are gaps in their metacognitive reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as tools for assessing RC item complexity, but their reasoning needs further development for robust metacognitive awareness.

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

### [54] [TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25069)
*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol introduces a framework for analyzing multidimensional semantic polarity fields under human collaboration, using transformer-based LLMs and clustering methods to detect polarity changes in discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional sentiment analysis methods that treat sentiment as unidimensional, ignoring the multidimensional and contextual nature of language.

Method: The study introduces the TOPol framework, which employs transformer-based large language models for embeddings, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and Leiden partitioning for topic segmentation. Polarity fields are computed through directional vectors between topic boundaries, guided by human-defined contextual boundaries.

Result: TOPol effectively identifies semantic polarity transitions across both affective and non-affective domains. The framework proves robust, with significant results arising only from changes in user-defined contextual boundaries, and is demonstrated on bank speeches and product review datasets.

Conclusion: TOPol provides a reliable and scalable framework for multidimensional discourse analysis, balancing human input with algorithmic stability to enhance sentiment and polarity detection in context-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates generative large language models (LLMs) for coreference resolution in biomedical texts, using various prompting techniques and comparing against the SpanBERT model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve coreference resolution in biomedical texts, a challenging task due to complex terminology, ambiguity, and long-distance dependencies.

Method: Experimented with four types of LLM prompting strategies, including contextual enrichment and domain-specific cues, and compared LLMs to SpanBERT.

Result: LLMs perform well at surface-level resolution and show improved performance with domain-specific prompts. However, they struggle with long-range dependencies and ambiguity.

Conclusion: LLMs, specifically LLaMA models, are promising for biomedical NLP tasks when enhanced with lightweight prompt engineering but still have limitations to address.

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEBATE, a benchmark designed to evaluate the authenticity of multi-agent interactions in role-playing LLMs, aiming to improve simulations of human-like opinion change dynamics. It demonstrates discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics along with addressing alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of inaccurate modeling of opinion change through interactions in social contexts, driven by problems like misinformation and polarization and the limitations of current LLM role-play setups.

Method: The authors developed DEBATE, a benchmark comprising 29,417 multi-round debate messages among 2,792 participants across 107 controversial topics. The study compares authentic human opinion trajectories with the dynamics produced in LLM role-play simulations.

Result: DEBATE highlights discrepancies between human and simulated group dynamics, showing gaps in current LLM capabilities. Fine-tuning LLMs with DEBATE improved superficial metrics but failed to fully align with deeper semantic measures.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the strengths and limitations of using role-playing LLMs to simulate human-like social dynamics, stressing the need for improved methods and benchmarks for better alignment.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines effective pretraining strategies for low-resource language translation models, focusing on Lingala and highlighting the role of multilingual integration and diverse data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve machine translation for low-resource languages, specifically Lingala, by utilizing advanced pretraining techniques inspired by methods for high-resource languages.

Method: The authors employed experiments with various pretraining methods, including multilingual integration and incorporating both monolingual and parallel datasets.

Result: Pretraining using multilingual input and a combination of monolingual and parallel data enhanced translation quality for the studied low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The study contributes to bridging the gap between resource-rich and underrepresented languages in NLP, offering reproducible insights, and making the code and datasets available for future improvements.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys techniques for machine unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a novel taxonomy, evaluating methods, and guiding future research towards ethically compliant and secure LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to prevent LLMs from memorizing sensitive data and comply with legal, ethical standards like the 'right to be forgotten'.

Method: Systematic review of over 180 papers, categorizing unlearning methods by their implementation stage (training-time, post-training, and inference-time) and evaluating datasets and metrics.

Result: Novel taxonomies for methods and evaluations were introduced; advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of current approaches analyzed; practical guidance provided for research community.

Conclusion: The survey informs ongoing development of safe and compliant LLMs, addressing challenges and proposing directions for future study.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

### [59] [Explainable Disentanglement on Discrete Speech Representations for Noise-Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25150)
*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end model that disentangles speech from background noise, resulting in noise-invariant speech tokens and improved ASR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize discrete audio representations for noisy real-world environments and enhance compatibility with large language models.

Method: The proposed approach separates clean speech into codebook tokens and isolates interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue, supervised via a lightweight classifier.

Result: The model improves text-speech alignment, achieves an 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper, and shows a 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.

Conclusion: The learned token space successfully generalizes across diverse acoustic conditions, proving effective in noisy scenarios.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [60] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current AI search systems struggle to efficiently process unstructured and noisy data from external knowledge sources. The Model-Document Protocol (MDP) is proposed to transform raw text into structured, task-specific inputs for LLMs, improving their efficiency and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient AI search arises from the difficulties of LLMs handling unstructured, noisy documents. Most retrieval systems leave the burden of assembling and reasoning on raw fragments to the LLM, creating inefficiencies.

Method: The paper introduces the Model-Document Protocol (MDP) with three pathways: agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured leveraging, designed to transform raw text into structured knowledge. An instantiation called MDP-Agent uses advanced techniques like gist memory creation, diffusion-based exploration, and map-reduce synthesis to improve retrieval and reasoning.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking tasks show that MDP-Agent significantly outperforms existing retrieval models, demonstrating the utility of the framework.

Conclusion: The MDP framework redefines document retrieval for LLMs, ensuring that structured and task-specific knowledge reaches the model. Its instantiation, MDP-Agent, showcases its practical superiority through enhanced reasoning and retrieval performance.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [61] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B on their performance in low-resource languages using a 10,000-question benchmark. CoT prompting improves accuracy for weaker models but reduces performance for stronger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the strong performance of large language models is rooted in genuine capability or merely their advantage from English-dominated datasets, particularly in low-resource language settings.

Method: The authors deployed a large-scale benchmark to test Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) across three languages of varying resource levels: English, Swahili, and Hausa, and used CoT prompting to study its impact on different LLMs.

Result: All tested LLMs performed sharply worse in low-resource languages. While CoT prompting improved performance for weaker models like LLaMA 3, it hindered stronger models like GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Flash due to ‘overthinking.’

Conclusion: The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting depends on the specific model and task context. This highlights variabilities in cross-lingual capabilities as well as the need for targeted strategies when dealing with low-resource languages.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

### [62] [ProMediate: A Socio-cognitive framework for evaluating proactive agents in multi-party negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25224)
*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProMediate, a framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations, claiming improvements in consensus changes and intervention speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for systematic evaluation of proactive AI agents designed for managing complex, multi-party collaborations.

Method: ProMediate includes two key features: a simulation testbed with adjustable difficulty levels and a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with metrics to measure AI intervention effectiveness and intelligence.

Result: Tests on ProMediate demonstrate that the socially intelligent mediator agent achieves better outcomes (3.6% improvement in consensus change) and faster interventions (77% faster response) compared to a generic baseline.

Conclusion: ProMediate provides a robust, theory-based platform to propel the development of effective and socially intelligent proactive AI agents for multi-party collaboration.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using synthetic data generation and multi-stage finetuning to enhance domain-specific question answering (QA) for the Hindi tourism domain in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of scarce annotated datasets and limited domain-specific knowledge in general-purpose language models for low-resource languages like Hindi.

Method: A multi-stage finetuning approach is implemented, leveraging synthetic question-answer pairs generated by large LLMs and combining them with limited original datasets to adapt small, lightweight models to the Hindi tourism domain.

Result: The study demonstrates that large models are effective at generating synthetic data, and small models can adapt effectively to this data, facilitating domain-specific QA in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Large LLMs and lightweight models together provide a scalable solution for developing domain-specific QA in low-resource languages such as Hindi.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PEKD, a framework to improve few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection by distillation from a teacher model and introducing entropy-aware gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting sarcasm in multimodal settings with scarce annotated data, which hampers model performance.

Method: Introduces PEKD framework that combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods with expert model distillation, alongside entropy-aware gating to adjust teacher signal strength based on confidence.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show PEKD improves performance of PEFT methods, surpassing prior approaches and large multimodal models in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PEKD enhances multimodal sarcasm detection in low-resource settings, is adaptable to various models/tasks, and achieves strong few-shot results.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

*Senjie Jin,Lu Chen,Zhiheng Xi,Yuhui Wang,Sirui Song,Yuhao Zhou,Xinbo Zhang,Peng Sun,Hong Lu,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Parrot, a training pipeline integrating Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought (P-CoT) to enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the unidirectional enhancement limitations between N-CoT and P-CoT by enabling their mutual and simultaneous improvements in mathematical problem-solving.

Method: Proposes Parrot, comprising: (1) Sequential integration of P-CoT and N-CoT generation through three subtasks, (2) Hybrid training strategy facilitating semantic transferability, and (3) Using converted N-CoT as auxiliary rewards to address sparse P-CoT optimization rewards.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in performance for both N-CoT and P-CoT, with a remarkable boost in N-CoT results on MathQA tasks, achieving +21.87 and +21.48 performance gains for LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA models.

Conclusion: Parrot leverages the strengths of both paradigms (N-CoT and P-CoT) for mathematical reasoning, demonstrating efficient and enhanced model performance.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

*Yilong Lai,Yipin Yang,Jialong Wu,Fengran Mo,Zhenglin Wang,Ting Liang,Jianguo Lin,Keping Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMWeaver is a novel method designed to enhance LLM-based business agents to handle intricate data relationships and heterogeneous tasks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for effective LLM-based agents capable of solving complex, real-world business problems involving diverse tasks and intricate data structures.

Method: CRMWeaver utilizes synthesis data generation and reinforcement learning during training, combined with a shared memories mechanism during inference to improve performance in complex and unseen business scenarios.

Result: CRMWeaver demonstrated competitive results in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, validating its efficacy on the CRMArena-Pro dataset.

Conclusion: The approach showcases significant promise for enhancing business agents in real-world applications, providing a practical solution for challenging business environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

*Abhishek Purushothama,Junghyun Min,Brandon Waldon,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study critiques the usage of large language models (LLMs) for legal interpretation, highlighting their instability and weak correlation with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and question the reliability of LLMs as an aid for legal interpretation and decision-making.

Method: Conducted empirical evaluation in English to test LLMs' interpretive judgments by observing variations in model outcomes based on different question formats.

Result: LLMs exhibit inconsistent interpretive results depending on question framing and show weak correlation with human judgment across model types and question variants.

Conclusion: LLMs are unreliable for legal interpretation, raising concerns about their suitability for aiding legal scholars and judges.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of instruction tuning on small-scale language models, exploring its impact on fine-tuning and zero-shot tasks using different curricula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and how instruction tuning can enhance the performance of small-scale language models, particularly in fine-tuned and zero-shot tasks, under limited computational and data resources.

Method: The study explores conversational and question-answering datasets for instruction tuning, applied via merged and sequential curricula, using decoder-only language models with parameters of 100M and 140M. Evaluations are conducted on fine-tuning tasks (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot tasks (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, etc.) to analyze performance.

Result: Sequential curricula led to consistent performance gains in fine-tuning tasks, while improvements for zero-shot tasks were less consistent. A trade-off exists between interaction-focused adaptation and linguistic generalization.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning shows promise for enhancing specific tasks in small-scale models but has limitations in generalization to zero-shot tasks. Curriculum-based strategies may help improve balance and performance under resource constraints.

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new pipeline using advanced language models and graph analysis to identify patterns of transformative technology convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is difficulty in forecasting transformative technologies due to rapid innovation cycles and unclear early-stage terminology, especially in domains like ICTs.

Method: A data-driven pipeline using large language models to extract semantic relationships, construct technology graphs, perform semantic grouping, and detect convergence through graph-based and temporal analysis.

Result: The methodology was validated using datasets from arXiv preprints and USPTO patents, showing successful identification of both established and emerging technological convergence patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is scalable, generalizable, and offers effective technology forecasting through full-text analysis of scientific and patent datasets.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

### [70] [Hallucinations in Bibliographic Recommendation: Citation Frequency as a Proxy for Training Data Redundancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25378)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4.1, demonstrate fewer hallucinated references for highly cited papers, while hallucination rates vary across research domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and mitigate bibliographic hallucination issues in LLM-generated content, hypothesizing that citation frequency affects factual accuracy.

Method: Using GPT-4.1, researchers generated and verified 100 bibliographic records across 20 computer science domains, measuring factual consistency between generated information and authentic metadata.

Result: Results showed citation count strongly correlates with factual accuracy, with highly cited papers almost verbatimly memorized past a threshold (~1,000 citations).

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are more consistently retained by LLMs, underscoring a memorization threshold where generalization shifts into data redundancy-derived accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SQPsych, a pipeline generating synthetic therapeutic dialogues using psychological questionnaires and structured client profiles, validated through expert and LLM assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of AI for mental health faces challenges due to the lack of authentic therapy dialogue data caused by privacy regulations and non-recorded sessions.

Method: SQPsych converts psychological input into natural language therapeutic dialogues utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles and open-weight LLMs.

Result: SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on the generated synthetic dialogues surpass baselines in counseling benchmarks, validated for clinical quality and performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a scalable and secure pathway for advancing AI in mental health, demonstrating its potential for clinical support while maintaining data privacy standards.

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

Motivation: Existing benchmarks are heavily Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their relevance for Indian contexts and multilingual domains.

Method: The paper introduces BhashaBench V1 with 74,166 question-answer pairs from government and domain-specific exams in English and Hindi, covering 90+ subdomains and 500+ topics for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 29+ LLMs shows considerable domain and language-specific performance gaps, especially in low-resource domains such as Ayurveda and Hindi content. For example, GPT-4 performs better in Legal but struggles in Ayurveda.

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 promotes broader Indian knowledge domain evaluation in LLMs, enabling bilingual and domain-specific assessments for better model refinement. Resources are openly accessible to encourage further research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need

### [73] [Serve Programs, Not Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25412)
*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLM serving systems lack efficiency and adaptability for complex applications. Symphony introduces a system for running customizable programs called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inflexible design of current LLM serving systems makes them inefficient and unsuitable for handling complex LLM applications.

Method: The authors introduce LLM Inference Programs (LIPs) to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime. They develop Symphony, a system acting as an operating system for LIPs, which uses system calls, a virtualized KV file system, and GPU optimization.

Result: Symphony introduces innovations like program execution for LLMs, runtime customization, and efficient resource management with GPU-aware scheduling.

Conclusion: Symphony paves the way for a more efficient and extensible framework for large language model applications, overcoming existing limitations.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision Language Model (VLM) framework for automating sign language dataset creation from social media videos, reducing manual effort while preserving data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing sign language translation datasets, such as small scale, high cost of annotation, and lack of multilingual coverage.

Method: The authors developed a VLM-based pipeline for automated annotation and filtering, which includes face visibility detection, sign activity recognition, text extraction, and alignment validation between video and text.

Result: The pipeline was applied to TikTok videos in eight sign languages and the YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language, producing a filtered dataset called TikTok-SL-8. Two SLT models were tested on the dataset in German and American Sign Languages.

Conclusion: The work enables scalable and weakly supervised pretraining for sign language translation and demonstrates potential for leveraging social media data to create diverse and multilingual sign language datasets.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle implicature in communication, concluding that incorporating implicature improves Human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Human-AI interaction by exploring the linguistic concept of implicature and its role in interpreting intent and creating more natural and effective communication.

Method: The study analyzed the ability of various LLMs to handle implicature through experiments testing their response quality and relevance to context-driven prompts with embedded implicature.

Result: Larger models better approximated human interpretations of implicature, outperforming smaller models that struggled with this concept. Implicature-enhanced prompts significantly improved response quality across all models, with smaller models showing the most notable gains. 67.6% of participants preferred implicature-embedded responses over literal ones.

Conclusion: Incorporating implicature into prompts enhances the naturalness and context-awareness of Human-AI interaction, offering insights into addressing alignment problems using linguistic theory.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLMEval, a challenging benchmark for neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization in research-level mathematics using real-world Lean projects. Existing models perform poorly on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited practical impact of large language models (LLMs) in research-level neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization, and to gauge their effectiveness on real-world mathematical tasks.

Method: The authors developed RLMEval, an evaluation suite based on real Lean Blueprint formalization projects, containing 613 theorems from six research-level Lean formalization projects.

Result: The evaluation of state-of-the-art models using RLMEval revealed a significant limitation, with the best-performing model achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate.

Conclusion: RLMEval highlights the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world theorem-proving tasks, aiming to drive advancements in automated formal mathematics.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [77] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in qualitative social science research, addressing their challenges while proposing a framework for usage based on interpretive depth and autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers in qualitative social science seek tools to enhance analysis, but LLM adoption encounters interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability.

Method: The authors classify LLM applications in qualitative research using a two-dimensional framework of interpretive depth and autonomy, complemented by practical design recommendations.

Result: Analyzing existing literature, the authors suggest decomposing tasks for supervised LLM use while focusing on manageable segments, similar to delegating work to research assistants.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables researchers to benefit from LLMs while maintaining transparency and reliability through controlled and supervised usage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Eleftherios Avramidis,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sign language translation evaluation metrics, including BLEU and ROUGE, have limitations, especially in capturing semantic equivalence, paraphrasing, and hallucination robustness. Large language model-based evaluators show promise but can be biased.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reliable current SLT text-based evaluation metrics are and address their limitations when assessing SLT outputs.

Method: The study analyzes six text-based metrics, including BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT, and LLM-based tools like G-Eval and GEMBA under controlled conditions like paraphrasing, hallucinations, and sentence length variations.

Result: LLM-based evaluators show improved semantic understanding compared to conventional metrics but exhibit biases. All metrics can detect hallucinations, but sensitivity varies across approaches.

Conclusion: Existing SLT evaluation metrics are insufficient, and there is a need for multimodal frameworks that go beyond text-based evaluations to better assess SLT outputs holistically.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

*Fei Wei,Daoyuan Chen,Ce Wang,Yilun Huang,Yushuo Chen,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework, 'Learn-to-Ask,' to train proactive dialogue agents using offline expert data without relying on costly user simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to become proactive and goal-oriented partners in high-stakes domains, overcoming the limitations of current paradigms that optimize single-turn attributes or use brittle user simulators.

Method: The method reframes offline policy learning by leveraging observed future trajectories of expert data, creating a turn-by-turn dense reward signal and training policies to generate action and state assessment tuples. An Automated Grader Calibration pipeline improves reward model fidelity.

Result: Empirical results show efficacy in a medical dataset and the successful deployment of LLMs into a live online AI service. Performance was superior to human experts during rigorous evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical, economically viable framework for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, real-world applications, offering a scalable solution to bridge the reality gap.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

*Jun Wang,Fuming Lin,Yuyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline combining fine-tuned LLMs with NER for domain-specific summarization and tagging, enhancing accuracy and application in real-time scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively address the challenges of extracting information from rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang in areas like security and politics.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned large language models using general-purpose and domain-specific datasets via the LLaMA Factory framework. They evaluated performance using BLEU and ROUGE metrics.

Result: Fine-tuning improved accuracy, particularly with specialized corpora. The LLaMA3-8B-Instruct model showed significant performance improvements, even surpassing language-specific models after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline demonstrates scalability and adaptability in transforming unstructured text into actionable insights, essential for efficient knowledge management and security operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

*Bangde Du,Minghao Guo,Songming He,Ziyi Ye,Xi Zhu,Weihang Su,Shuqi Zhu,Yujia Zhou,Yongfeng Zhang,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TwinVoice, a benchmark for evaluating language models' persona simulation across diverse contexts and capabilities. Current advanced models moderately simulate personas but lag behind humans in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of language models for persona simulation are limited and lack comprehensive frameworks, compelling the need for systematic tools to assess their performance effectively.

Method: The TwinVoice benchmark evaluates persona simulation across three contexts—Social Persona, Interpersonal Persona, and Narrative Persona—and analyzes six fundamental capabilities: opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style.

Result: Advanced language models show moderate accuracy in persona simulation but exhibit significant shortcomings in capabilities like syntactic style and memory recall. Their performance remains below human benchmarks.

Conclusion: Despite advancements, LLMs still underperform compared to humans in persona simulation, emphasizing the need for enhanced model development and better methodologies for evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

*Run Peng,Ziqiao Ma,Amy Pang,Sikai Li,Zhang Xi-Jia,Yingzhuo Yu,Cristian-Paul Bara,Joyce Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents collaborating under information asymmetry, and proposes a framework combining fine-tuning and environmental verification to improve task solving and rule comprehension with aligned communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM agents are often used for goal-driven action planning, their ability to collaborate effectively—especially under disparities in knowledge and skills—has been underexplored. The authors aim to fill this gap, examining effective collaboration and communication in solving shared symbolic puzzles.

Method: The authors adapt the Einstein Puzzles into a tabletop game requiring two LLM agents to collaborate by reasoning, communicating, and acting under spatial and relational constraints. They employ a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework, incorporating communication strategies and feedback from the environment.

Result: Empirical testing showed that aligned communication is crucial for success, especially if agents can both seek and provide information. Non-communicating agents can perform tasks well but lack true rule understanding and trust from human evaluators. Using environmental verification bolsters understanding and collaboration.

Conclusion: Integrating verification signals with aligned communication enhances LLM agents' collaboration and comprehension of task rules—even under challenging conditions with information asymmetry. This improves interpretability and safety in AI systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

TL;DR: The study introduces FARSIQA, an advanced question-answering system for Persian Islamic domains, addressing gaps in multi-hop queries with a novel FAIR-RAG architecture that ensures faithful, iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges of hallucination and unfaithfulness in large language models within high-stakes domains like Persian Islamic question answering, where accuracy and reliability are essential.

Method: The authors propose FARSIQA, built on the FAIR-RAG framework, which employs a dynamic, iterative process to decompose complex queries, assess evidence, and refine answers, based on a curated database of over one million Islamic documents.

Result: FARSIQA achieved state-of-the-art results on the IslamicPCQA benchmark, with 97.0% Negative Rejection and 74.3% Answer Correctness, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The iterative, adaptive architecture of FAIR-RAG proves to be crucial in developing reliable AI for sensitive domains, setting a new performance standard for Persian Islamic question answering.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

*Davide Romano,Jonathan Schwarz,Daniele Giofré*

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of test-time scaling methods for legal multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) across five benchmarks, analyzing verifier performance under realistic computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of verifier-based test-time scaling (TTS) in argumentative domains like law, which is relatively underexplored compared to formal domains such as mathematics and programming.

Method: The study implements verifier-based TTS for legal MCQA using 7 reward models and evaluates outcome-level (Best-of-N) and process-level (tree search) verification under low-N computational budgets. Various properties affecting verifier performance are analyzed.

Result: The analysis reveals insights about the impact of factors like domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised vs. outcome-only models) on verifier utility in legal QA tasks.

Conclusion: Verifier-based test-time scaling techniques show potential in improving performance for legal MCQA, with their effectiveness being influenced by domain-specific and methodological factors.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

*Andreas Opedal,Yanick Zengaffinen,Haruki Shirakami,Clemente Pasti,Mrinmaya Sachan,Abulhair Saparov,Ryan Cotterell,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses how language models (LMs) perform deductive reasoning efficiently, proposing a framework to evaluate efficiency through logic programming principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluations for LMs focus on correctness but neglect their ability to reason efficiently, especially when dealing with irrelevant information in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors align natural-language proofs generated by LMs with optimal shortest proofs derived from logic programming and measure efficiency via avoidance of unnecessary inference.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates that current LMs struggle with efficiency, particularly when irrelevant axioms are present, leading to accuracy drops and detours in inference.

Conclusion: Language models exhibit strong deductive reasoning but lack robust ability to ignore distractions, highlighting a need for improvement in reasoning efficiency frameworks for LMs.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHR-Ins, a large-scale dataset designed for reasoning tasks in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and develops EHR-R1—a reasoning-enhanced large language model (LLM)—along with EHR-Bench for benchmarking EHR analysis. The model shows significant improvement over existing LLMs in diverse clinical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in reasoning and task coverage of large language models (LLMs) for effective automated analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in clinical decision-making.

Method: The core methodology involves creating a large-scale reasoning-driven dataset (EHR-Ins) through a thinking-graph framework, training advanced LLMs (EHR-R1) with domain adaptation and reasoning enhancement, and developing a benchmarking system (EHR-Bench).

Result: EHR-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3), achieving over a 30-point improvement on MIMIC-Bench and a 10% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Conclusion: The proposed EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench significantly advance automated EHR analysis by improving reasoning capabilities, domain adaptation, and performance on clinical tasks, demonstrating reliability and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

*Jiani Zheng,Zhiyang Teng,Xiangtai Li,Anran Wang,Yu Tian,Kunpeng Qiu,Ye Tian,Haochen Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PairUni, a unified framework for vision-language tasks combining understanding and generation, using reorganized paired data (UG pairs) and a novel RL approach called Pair-GPRO for improved UVLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models face challenges in balancing heterogeneous data and tasks during reinforcement learning, necessitating innovative methods to harmonize understanding and generation tasks within one architecture.

Method: The study organizes task data into understanding-generation pairs (UG pairs) using GPT-o3 for augmentation and retrieves semantically related examples. Pair-GPRO, a variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, is employed to enhance RL by leveraging semantic correspondences and reducing task interference.

Result: PairUni achieves balanced performance improvements across UVLMs, surpassing strong RL baselines by leveraging a curated dataset (PairUG) with 16K UG pairs for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The PairUni framework and its pair-aware learning approach enhance UVLM reinforcement learning, successfully integrating understanding and generation tasks within a single model.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

*Saeed AlMarri,Kristof Juhasz,Mathieu Ravaut,Gautier Marti,Hamdan Al Ahbabi,Ibrahim Elfadel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares zero-shot LLM classifiers with LightGBM for loan default predictions and examines predictive performance, feature attribution via SHAP, and LLM self-explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the suitability of LLMs for structured tabular data in high-stakes applications like financial risk assessment.

Method: A systematic comparison between zero-shot LLMs and LightGBM on a loan default dataset, evaluation of predictive performance, feature attribution analysis using SHAP, and assessment of LLM self-explanations.

Result: LLMs can identify key financial indicators but differ significantly in feature importance rankings compared to LightGBM, and their self-explanations often diverge from SHAP attributions.

Conclusion: LLMs are not fully reliable standalone models for structured financial risk predictions; explainability audits and human oversight are crucial for deployment in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Toolathlon," a benchmark for evaluating language agents on complex, multi-step workflows across various apps. It involves 108 realistic tasks spanning 32 apps and 604 tools, revealing significant limitations of current state-of-the-art models in handling real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for language agents fall short in reflecting the diversity, realism, and long-term complexity of tasks encountered in real-world applications.

Method: The authors developed Toolathlon, which incorporates 32 diverse software applications, 604 tools, and 108 realistic tasks that require multi-turn interactions across diverse apps. Real-world environment states and execution-based evaluation scripts ensure authenticity and reliability.

Result: Comprehensive testing on state-of-the-art models revealed their inadequacies, with leading models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieving only a 38.6% success rate and most open-weight models, like DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, performing even worse.

Conclusion: The Toolathlon benchmark highlights significant room for improvement in current language agents and sets the stage for their advancement for realistic, complex, and long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### [90] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines unlearning in large language models (LLMs) and introduces methods to evaluate the effectiveness of persuading unlearned models to recall factual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing sensitive data and misinformation in large language models by understanding and evaluating their unlearning process.

Method: The authors propose the Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which uses cognitive and communication theories to model information entanglement and tests the effects of persuasive prompts on factual recall.

Result: Persuasive prompts improve factual recall significantly (e.g., 14.8% baseline to 24.5% with authority framing). Smaller models showed higher effectiveness in recall, while larger models were less responsive.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into evaluating unlearning in LLMs, highlighting the role of persuasive prompts and emphasizing the inverse relationship between model size and recall efficiency.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro introduces LoopLMs to integrate reasoning into the pre-training phase with iterative computation, entropy-regularized depth allocation, and scalability to 7.7T tokens, achieving comparable results with larger SOTA LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs largely rely on post-training explicit reasoning, like CoT, under-utilizing pre-training data. This paper aims to incorporate reasoning directly into pre-training.

Method: Developing LoopLMs that perform reasoning during pre-training using iterative latent computations, entropy-regularized objectives, and large-scale data (7.7T tokens).

Result: LoopLM models (Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B) match or outperform much larger state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating better knowledge manipulation and aligned reasoning traces compared to CoT.

Conclusion: LoopLM represents a promising direction for advancing reasoning capabilities in the pre-training phase of LLMs, with models demonstrating strong performance and usability as scaling approaches in the reasoning era.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights the limitations of one-time task completion evaluations for agents and advocates for a new approach focusing on collaboration and iterative problem-solving, rather than simple task accomplishment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional agent evaluations that prioritize one-shot task completion, neglecting the iterative and collaborative nature of real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Method: A framework called 'collaborative effort scaling' is introduced to measure how effectively an agent engages with and leverages user involvement. Case studies and simulations are used to evaluate agents under real-world-like multi-turn scenarios.

Result: Findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents often fail in multi-turn real-world applications, underperforming in sustained engagement and user understanding scaffolding.

Conclusion: The study suggests that collaborative effort scaling is essential for diagnosing and improving agent behavior, advocating a shift towards creating agents that enhance human collaboration during problem-solving.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

*Chumeng Liang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents DiagramEval, a metric system to evaluate diagram quality generated by LLMs using graph conceptualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality diagrams for research papers is complex and labor-intensive while existing image generative models struggle to achieve the required structure and clarity.

Method: The authors propose DiagramEval, which assesses diagram quality by conceptualizing diagrams as graphs. They evaluate diagrams based on node and path alignment using state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: DiagramEval effectively evaluates diagrams generated by LLMs, validating its metrics. Enhanced explainability further provides insights into LLM-generated diagrams.

Conclusion: DiagramEval is a novel and effective solution for assessing demonstration diagrams, pushing the boundaries for diagram generation and evaluation in academic research.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

TL;DR: The paper introduces DecompTune, a method for improving attribution in long-document question answering by reframing it as a reasoning problem, utilizing decomposition steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive QA scenarios, making reliable attribution to sources difficult.

Method: The authors propose generating answer decompositions alongside attributions while introducing DecompTune, a post-training method where models learn decompositions as reasoning steps. A diverse QA dataset is curated, and models are trained using a two-stage pipeline with curated rewards.

Result: DecompTune improves attribution quality significantly, surpassing prior methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance in various QA tasks.

Conclusion: Reframing attribution as a reasoning process enhances reliability in long-document QA, with DecompTune demonstrating superior attribution and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Result: Demonstrated impact of data filtering and contamination on fluency, coherence, and benchmark performance, and provided insights into neural filtering effects.

Conclusion: The release fosters research on optimizing trade-offs in language model evaluation, safety, and data curation in multilingual settings.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic driving scenes reconstruction caused by complex dynamics and sparse views, aiming for a method balancing quality and efficiency.

Method: DrivingScene employs a lightweight residual flow network for predicting non-rigid motion based on scene flow, coupled with a coarse-to-fine training paradigm to improve stability.

Result: The method achieved superior depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point cloud generation compared to state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: DrivingScene provides an efficient, high-quality solution to dynamic driving scene reconstruction, showcasing better performance in depth and scene generation tasks.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM) and the Human Motion Insight (HMI) dataset to improve accuracy and motion representation in video captioning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models often fail to capture detailed human motion, leading to inaccurate or vague descriptions.

Method: M-ACM incorporates motion representations from human mesh recovery to enhance semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in captions.

Result: M-ACM outperforms previous models, providing more accurate and detailed video captions in tests against human motion datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating motion-aware techniques and datasets significantly enhances video captioning for complex human actions, advancing the field of motion-focused captioning.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

Result: The authors provide latency insights for ViTs and demonstrate that their dataset enables sufficiently accurate prediction of inference latencies for new ViT models in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the usability of their dataset and insights for improving and predicting the performance of ViT architectures on mobile devices, aiding the deployment of efficient models in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in machine learning techniques on mobile

quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision
transformers (ViTs) on mobile devices. Through a comparison with 102 real-world

TL;DR: This work focuses on training Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) using SAR images, addressing issues arising due to synthetic data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome the problem of lack of real labeled SAR measurements by using synthetic datasets generated by different SAR simulation paradigms.

Method: The authors demonstrate the effects of simulation paradigms and propose combining two complementary SAR simulators (MOCEM and Salsa) for synthetic dataset generation, training models with ADASCA Deep Learning approach.

Result: An ATR model achieved almost 88% accuracy when tested on MSTAR measurements, indicating improved performance using combined simulator datasets.

Conclusion: The combined use of MOCEM and Salsa simulators with ADASCA approach enhances the representativity of synthetic datasets, which improves ATR model accuracy on real SAR measurements.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning framework for point-level uncertainty evaluation in Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds, addressing the limitations of traditional backward uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of traditional uncertainty modeling methods, which require costly high-precision reference data, inspired the need for an alternative scalable approach.

Method: The study uses a machine learning-based framework using Random Forest and XGBoost models trained on spatially partitioned datasets to predict point-level uncertainty based on local geometric features.

Result: Experimental results show the models achieve high performance with ROC-AUC values above 0.87. Geometric features like elevation variation, point density, and structural complexity are key predictors of uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and adaptable method for uncertainty evaluation in large-scale MLS point clouds, enhancing future quality control and error analysis applications.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework integrating eye-tracking and facial features for accurate Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, achieving 95.11% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by utilizing multimodal approaches, particularly integrating eye-tracking and facial features, which are key indicators of cognitive function.

Method: A multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework was developed, featuring a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions and a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for capturing directional facial features. A multimodal dataset was constructed using synchronized facial video and eye-tracking data.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 95.11% accuracy in distinguishing Alzheimer's patients from healthy individuals, outperforming traditional fusion methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific attributes, demonstrating significant potential for robust Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimization framework (ESCA) for accelerating high-fidelity Codec Avatar (PCA) models on resource-constrained VR devices using efficient post-training quantization and custom hardware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of high computational demands imposed by photorealistic Codec Avatar models, which hinder real-time performance on limited-resource VR head-mounted devices.

Method: The authors propose PTQ (post-training quantization) for enabling low-precision execution and develop a custom hardware accelerator integrated into VR devices' system-on-chip. They combine these elements into a full-stack framework called ESCA.

Result: ESCA shows significant improvements: +0.39 FovVideoVDP quality score over the best 4-bit baseline, 3.36× latency reduction, and supports real-time rendering rates of 100 frames per second.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-fidelity Codec Avatars on resource-limited VR platforms, enhancing immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [104] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of vision models for graph understanding, showing they outperform GNNs in tasks requiring global structural perception and scale invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emphasize bottom-up message passing, conflicting with human visual perception that intuitively understands global structures. This paper aims to address this discrepancy by exploring the capabilities of vision models in graph understanding.

Method: The authors compare vision models with GNNs on traditional benchmarks and introduce a new benchmark, GraphAbstract, to test models' abilities to perceive global graph properties like organization, symmetry, and connectivity.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks demanding holistic understanding of graphs, such as recognizing global patterns and generalizing across graph scales. GNNs struggle with these tasks, particularly as graph size increases.

Conclusion: Vision models demonstrate strong capabilities in graph structural understanding, particularly for tasks requiring topological awareness. This opens avenues for improved graph foundation models based on holistic visual perception.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents RSGSLM, a method combining graph-based semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labeling to enhance multi-view data classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of lacking clear graph structures in images and the complexity of multi-view data, which limit the efficiency of current semi-supervised and graph-based learning techniques.

Method: The proposed method integrates linear feature transformation, multi-view graph fusion, pseudo-labeling for dynamic GCN loss improvement, weight adjustments for topological balance near class boundaries, and an unsupervised smoothing loss.

Result: Experimental results show that RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods on multi-view benchmark image datasets.

Conclusion: RSGSLM is an effective and computationally efficient method for addressing the challenges of graph-based semi-supervised learning in multi-view data contexts.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PISA-Bench, a high-quality multilingual benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs), derived from educational tests, and uncovers challenges faced by models, especially small ones, in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking VLMs faces limitations due to reliance on synthetic data, monolingual datasets, and a lack of multilingual human-verified examples, which restricts their evaluative power and applicability.

Method: The authors created PISA-Bench by extracting human-authored content from PISA tests, translating it into six languages, categorizing question types, and comprising instructions, questions, answers, and images for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show low performance, especially smaller models (<20B parameters), with degradation in multilingual datasets and struggling on spatial/geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench fills a critical gap as a robust multilingual resource, highlighting weaknesses in current models, and aims to drive further VLM research in multilingual and multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: To tackle computational and data bottlenecks limiting the deployment of Vision-Language-Action models for embodied intelligence.

Method: The paper organizes efforts within a unified taxonomy including Efficient Model Design, Efficient Training, and Efficient Data Collection, critically reviewing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The survey summarizes representative applications, identifies challenges, and provides a roadmap for future research.

Conclusion: This work serves as a foundational guide for the research community and proposes efficient approaches to advance VLAs despite resource limitations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [108] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates conflict adaptation in vision-language models (VLMs) using a sequential Stroop task, identifying behavior similar to human cognitive control and specific neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore whether vision-language models exhibit characteristics of human cognitive control, specifically focusing on conflict adaptation and its neural representations.

Method: A sequential Stroop task was used to test 13 VLMs, while sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were employed to analyze task-relevant representations within InternVL 3.5 4B.

Result: 12 out of 13 VLMs displayed behavior consistent with conflict adaptation. Specific supernodes linked to task-relevant processes were identified, one of which modulates conflict and significantly impacts Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs can exhibit human-like conflict adaptation, and their representational basis can be dissected using SAEs. This suggests parallels between neural mechanisms in humans and artificial systems.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DualCap, a model enriching image captioning by integrating visual prompts from image-to-image retrieval, addressing semantic gaps in prior methods relying on text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight image captioning models rely solely on text prompts, leading to a semantic gap and inadequate enhancement of visual features for complex scenes.

Method: DualCap uses dual retrieval: image-to-text for text prompts and image-to-image for visual prompts. It extracts keywords from captions of visually similar images and integrates these textual features with image features via a feature fusion network.

Result: DualCap shows competitive performance across experiments while utilizing fewer parameters compared to existing visual-prompting methods.

Conclusion: Enriching visual representation with visual prompts enhances image captioning efficiency and accuracy, making DualCap a lightweight and effective solution.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a three-stage deep learning framework to improve fish freshness assessment using visual features, achieving notable accuracy improvements on a specialized dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent traditional sensory methods for fish freshness evaluation, and improve reliability and accuracy using deep learning.

Method: The study employs five state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to extract visual features. Multi-level features train classical machine learning classifiers, while feature selection methods refine the predictive model for better accuracy.

Result: Experiments show that combining Swin-Tiny features, Extra Trees classifier, and LGBM-based feature selection achieves 85.99% accuracy, surpassing previous studies on a fish freshness dataset by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines deep learning and traditional methods, demonstrating strong generalizability and reliability in visual fish freshness evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video fake news detection benchmarks focus solely on accuracy without offering a detailed analysis of the detection process, making it a black box. The paper aims to address this limitation by providing a holistic assessment method.

Method: The authors developed MVFNDB, a detailed benchmark with 10 tasks and 9730 human-annotated questions to analyze MLLMs’ abilities in perception, understanding, and reasoning. The paper also introduces MVFND-CoT, a framework combining creator-added content and original footage for enhanced reasoning.

Result: The study highlights how integrating varied video features influences detection accuracy. It provides insights into video processing techniques and how well model capabilities align with video input features.

Conclusion: MVFNDB will serve as a key foundation for advancing and evaluating MLLMs in the field of video fake news detection, addressing current gaps in benchmark assessments.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-round safety editing framework for text-to-image models, addressing limitations in current inference-time methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety methods for T2I models face challenges such as inefficiency, over-refusal, and balancing safety with utility.

Method: The authors propose a model-agnostic framework with MR-SafeEdit and SafeEditor, using a post-hoc safety editing paradigm to refine unsafe content in text-to-image generation.

Result: SafeEditor demonstrates better performance by reducing over-refusal and achieving a balanced safety-utility trade-off compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient and effective safety alignment for T2I models, enhancing their application while reducing safety risks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid network model, MCIHN, for improving multimodal emotion recognition by addressing challenges like inter-modality differences and unimodal characterization. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate its superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of emotion recognition across different modalities and the difficulty in effectively characterizing unimodal emotional information for improved human-computer interaction.

Method: The proposed MCIHN employs adversarial autoencoders to extract discriminative emotion features for each modality and uses a Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model to reduce inter-modality discrepancies. It then utilizes a Feature Fusion module for multimodal integration.

Result: Experiments conducted on SIMS and MOSI datasets show that the MCIHN model achieves superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MCIHN successfully addresses challenges in multimodal emotion recognition and sets a new benchmark in accuracy, enhancing the potential for future human-computer interaction systems.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about

*Anne Gagneux,Ségolène Martin,Rémi Gribonval,Mathurin Massias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines flow matching models through a denoising framework to understand and assess the quality of their generative processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the factors influencing the quality of flow matching's generative process, an area that remains poorly understood.

Method: The approach involves establishing connections between flow matching and denoisers, proposing empirical comparisons, and introducing controlled perturbations like noise and drift to study sample generation.

Result: The study identifies distinct dynamical phases of the generative process and provides precise insights into when denoisers succeed or fail during generative stages.

Conclusion: Understanding the interaction of noise and dynamics in flow matching can lead to improved generative performance and offers deeper insights into the functioning of denoisers in various stages.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

*Sidharth Rai,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Benjamin Vail,Keziban Yalçın Dokumacı,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes reframing fruit maturity estimation as a continuous probabilistic task, utilizing a modified RT-DETRv2 model with a probabilistic head, resulting in improved accuracy and biological relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the process of estimating fruit and vegetable maturity for agricultural automation, replacing traditional discrete classifications with more biologically plausible continuous assessments.

Method: A novel probabilistic head is introduced to the RT-DETRv2 model, enabling it to predict continuous maturity distributions and uncertainty for detected objects.

Result: The approach maintains exceptional detection performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.6% on a large fruit dataset, delivering finer and more uncertainly-aware assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic approach advances modern agricultural automation by providing richer, more accurate, and uncertainty-informed assessment of fruit maturity, aiding robotic decision-making like selective harvesting.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy to achieve efficient and accurate recognition of Brazilian Sign Language using lightweight landmark detection methods and simple imputation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance inefficiencies caused by heavy computational demands of conventional landmark extraction tools (like OpenPose) while preserving or enhancing recognition accuracy.

Method: The research replaced OpenPose with a lighter tool, MediaPipe, and employed landmark subset selection strategies combined with spline-based imputation to optimize recognition performance.

Result: The proposed methods achieved recognition performance comparable to state-of-the-art techniques but significantly improved processing speed by more than 5 times.

Conclusion: Efficient and scalable sign language recognition systems can be achieved through careful landmark selection and lightweight detection approaches, ensuring both accuracy and time efficiency.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses urban traffic congestion by presenting a vehicle detection methodology using DBSCAN based on camera feed analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to increasing traffic delays and inefficiencies in urban cities, there is a need for methods to optimize traffic flow effectively.

Method: The method involves background computation through pixel averaging in sequential camera frames, followed by vehicle detection using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

Result: The methodology demonstrates a computationally efficient and practical solution for vehicle detection without requiring significant infrastructure changes.

Conclusion: The presented approach is scalable and applicable to real-world systems, providing a key component toward a comprehensive traffic optimization framework.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VividCam, a training paradigm for text-to-video generative models that relies on synthetic data to learn complex camera motions, addressing the challenge of limited training videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generative models are limited in handling unconventional camera motions due to the scarcity of training videos with such motions.

Method: The proposed approach uses synthetic videos with disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning, mitigating domain shifts caused by artificial appearances in synthetic data.

Result: VividCam effectively learns precise and complex camera motions even from simple synthetic data, such as low-poly 3D scenes rendered by engines like Unity.

Conclusion: VividCam represents a significant advancement in enabling generative models to synthesize artistic videos with unique camera motions using simple synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of multi-view transformers, which hampers improvement and safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors developed an approach to probe and visualize 3D representations using residual connections in multi-view transformer layers and applied it to analyze DUSt3R.

Result: The study illuminates the evolving latent state in DUSt3R, clarifies layer roles, and reveals its refinement of correspondences via reconstructed geometry.

Conclusion: The analysis contributes to understanding multi-view transformer models like DUSt3R, enabling potential improvements and safer applications.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-SAM is a model-agnostic framework enhancing multimodal learning by balancing modality contributions, decomposing loss landscapes, and optimizing weight updates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning often suffers from dominant modalities overshadowing others, reducing generalization effectiveness.

Method: M-SAM consists of three iterations: using Shapley values to identify dominant modality, decomposing the loss landscape for robustness, and updating weights with modulated gradients.

Result: Experiments on four diverse datasets demonstrate M-SAM's superiority over state-of-the-art optimization methods in balancing and improving multimodal learning.

Conclusion: M-SAM improves multimodal learning by ensuring robust learning for dominant modalities while enhancing contributions from others, successfully exploring complementary features to boost model performance.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of overfitting in Wi-Fi sensing models, which hampers their ability to generalize to new data, particularly for applications in healthcare, space occupancy, and gesture control.

Method: The study proposes a hybrid architecture named IBIS, which combines Inception-BiLSTM and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to enhance model generalization and establish robust classification boundaries.

Result: When applied to Doppler-derived data, the IBIS method achieves nearly 99% accuracy in movement recognition with evidence of improved performance metrics and accuracy through confusion matrices.

Conclusion: IBIS effectively addresses the overfitting problem in Wi-Fi sensing, demonstrating robust generalization and high accuracy, making it a promising solution for practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new model called FT-ARM, a fine-tuned multimodal large language model, to improve accuracy and interpretability in classifying pressure ulcer (PU) classifications (Stages I-IV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pressure ulcers are a serious healthcare issue, and accurate classification of their severity is crucial for effective treatment. Current methods involve subjective interpretations, leading to variability among clinicians. Existing AI approaches offer limited interpretability, creating a need for a more reliable, transparent automated system.

Method: The researchers developed FT-ARM, which integrates a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic self-reflection mechanism. It iteratively refines predictions by combining analysis of visual features with encoded clinical knowledge from text data. It was tested on a Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID).

Result: FT-ARM achieved 85% accuracy in PU stage classification (Stages I-IV), outperforming previous CNN models by 4%. It is also capable of live inference and generates clinically grounded natural-language explanations for improved transparency and trust.

Conclusion: FT-ARM advances the field of automated medical diagnosis by offering more accurate, consistent, interpretable, and deployable models for PU severity classification, potentially improving patient care with better clinical applicability than earlier models.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Motivation: To tackle challenges in ALPR such as environmental conditions, high vehicle speed, and low-resolution images, which hinder its application in traffic control, parking, and law enforcement.

Method: The method employs YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition with semi-supervised learning. Grounding DINO generates pseudo-labels to reduce manual annotation in combination with human-verified data for model training.

Result: Achieved a recall rate of 94% on the CENPARMI dataset and 91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. Character error rates for both datasets were also reported to further evaluate performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method using YOLOv8 and a semi-supervised framework effectively improves the accuracy and efficiency of ALPR while reducing manual intervention in dataset preparation.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a clinically viable approach for CAD systems by effectively fusing imaging and patient data, setting a new paradigm in breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with

and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs of large-scale pretraining hinder researchers from training vision-language models from scratch.

Method: Proposes 'Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP)', which dynamically merges visual encoder tokens adaptively in deeper layers.

Result: DRIP reduces GFLOPs significantly on ImageNet and CLIP pretraining while maintaining classification and zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: DRIP enhances pretraining efficiency and demonstrates the technique's application potential, even extending its use to large-scale biological datasets.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks and custom datasets validate significant improvements in accuracy and coherence for object recognition, activity detection, and scene captioning.

Conclusion: Cross-modal alignment and language grounding are effective in generalizing zero-shot scene understanding in diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a per-subject-tuning-free (PSTF) method for precise facial attribute control and identity preservation in image generation, leveraging StyleGAN2 and a novel cross-attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generation methods either require technical expertise and extensive data for tuning, or fail to achieve fine-grained control over facial attributes in PSTF frameworks.

Method: The approach combines a face recognition model for identity extraction mapped onto StyleGAN2's latent space using the e4e encoder, enhanced by a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module.

Result: Their model, trained on the FFHQ dataset, generates high-quality personalized images with precise facial attribute control, without needing additional tuning or individual-specific data.

Conclusion: This method efficiently addresses limitations of PSTF approaches, offering an accessible and adaptable solution for personalized facial image synthesis, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bio-inspired imaging system combining a spherical monocentric lens and reconstruction algorithms to achieve high-quality RGB and depth imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity RGBD imaging is challenging due to issues with compact optical designs and limitations of software-based depth estimation methods.

Method: A novel spherical monocentric lens design paired with a dual-head, multi-scale neural network jointly reconstructs All-in-Focus images and depth maps from coded captures.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing depth estimation and image restoration methods, achieving high accuracy and fidelity metrics.

Conclusion: The integration of bio-inspired optics and reconstruction algorithms is an effective approach for compact RGBD imaging, showcasing optimal performance in both depth precision and image clarity.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will

### [132] [Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)
*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VDRP, enhancing zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection by addressing visual diversity challenges and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve zero-shot HOI detection by resolving visual complexities, including intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Method: Proposes visual diversity-aware prompt learning and region-specific concept retrieval using pretrained vision-language models.

Result: VDRP outperforms existing methods on the HICO-DET benchmark across multiple zero-shot evaluation settings.

Conclusion: VDRP effectively enhances HOI detection by addressing visual diversity and entanglement challenges, offering state-of-the-art benchmark outcomes.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPADE, a monocular depth estimation approach, to enhance underwater vehicle spatial awareness, enabling efficient and accurate inspections using dense, metric scale depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater infrastructure encounters frequent inspection challenges due to harsh conditions, perceptual limitations, and operational constraints of current methods.

Method: Introducing SPADE, a monocular depth estimation pipeline combining pre-trained relative depth estimators and sparse depth priors, refined with Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks for depth accuracy.

Result: SPADE achieves higher accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, running efficiently at over 15 FPS, making it suitable for practical embedded applications.

Conclusion: SPADE significantly enhances underwater inspection capabilities by improving depth estimation accuracy and efficiency, supporting future autonomous underwater interventions.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel technique combining Atlanta-world models and implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting is proposed to achieve efficient and detailed 3D reconstruction for indoor and urban environments, addressing issues like low-texture regions and discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve 3D reconstruction accuracy and efficiency in indoor and urban environments, which suffer from low-texture regions and limitations of existing methods like Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields.

Method: The method integrates an Atlanta-world model for addressing low-texture reconstruction and introduces a novel implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting with semantic GS representation and structure plane regularization for detailed and smooth reconstructions.

Result: This approach demonstrated superior surface reconstruction quality in both indoor and urban settings, surpassing state-of-the-art methods according to experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively achieves smooth, high-frequency detail preservation and efficient 3D reconstructions, overcoming challenges in prior techniques.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

### [135] [Region-CAM: Towards Accurate Object Regions in Class Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised Learning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25134)
*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a novel method improving upon Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to address key limitations, ensuring better object region coverage and boundary alignment for weakly supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods often highlight only the most discriminative object regions, failing to cover entire objects or align accurately with boundaries. This limitation reduces performance in tasks like Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands high pixel-level accuracy.

Method: Region-CAM introduces semantic information maps (SIMs) and semantic information propagation (SIP) in classification model stages to generate activation maps. The approach utilizes both gradients and features to highlight broader object regions and ensure alignment with object boundaries.

Result: Region-CAM improves mIoU significantly on datasets like PASCAL VOC (13.61% and 13.13% improvements for training and validation) and MS COCO (16.23% enhancement over original CAM). It also achieves better Top-1 Localization accuracy on ILSVRC2012, outperforming LayerCAM by 4.5%.

Conclusion: Region-CAM effectively addresses the limitations of conventional CAM by delivering superior region coverage and boundary alignment. The method significantly boosts performance in weakly supervised tasks, validating its advantage over prior approaches like LayerCAM.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DINO-YOLO, a hybrid model combining YOLOv12 and DINOv3 vision transformers for efficient object detection in data-constrained civil engineering scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art detection performance while maintaining real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Civil engineering applications require accurate object detection but often lack substantial annotated data, limiting the efficacy of traditional models.

Method: The authors combine features from DINOv3 self-supervised transformers with YOLOv12 detection models at strategic points (input preprocessing and mid-backbone enhancement) and perform systematic ablation studies to optimize performance.

Result: DINO-YOLO significantly improves detection accuracy across diverse datasets (Tunnel Segment Crack +12.4%, Construction PPE +13.7%, KITTI +88.6%) with acceptable inference overhead, achieving real-time processing speeds.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO advances object detection in civil engineering datasets under 10K images while balancing accuracy with efficiency, enabling practical field deployment and enhancing construction safety and infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReGap, a method to enhance the detection of AI-generated images by leveraging dynamic reconstruction error using controlled perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring authenticity of images is crucial as AI-generated images become prevalent, but existing detection methods lack reliability and interpretability.

Method: Proposes ReGap, a training-free approach that introduces structured perturbations and measures reconstruction error changes dynamically.

Result: ReGap improves detection accuracy, is robust to post-processing, and generalizes well in varied conditions, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ReGap addresses limitations in AI-image detection methods by improving error separation, enhancing accuracy, and providing robustness across scenarios.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current methods that rely on offline-collected multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry for scene understanding.

Method: EA3D dynamically processes streaming video frames using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders, embeds knowledge in Gaussian feature maps, updates them incrementally, and employs joint optimization for enhanced reconstruction and understanding.

Result: EA3D shows strong performance across diverse benchmarks and tasks such as rendering, segmentation, bounding box estimation, semantic occupancy prediction, and mesh generation.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, unified method for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and open-world scene understanding, supporting various downstream applications.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

*Gautam A. Viruthagiri,Arnuv Tandon,Gerald G. Fuller,Vinny Chandran Suja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision transformer-based method for reconstructing thin film thickness profiles from interferograms, simplifying and improving real-time liquid film measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenges in reconstructing liquid film thickness profiles from interference patterns, which face difficulties such as phase periodicity, noise, and artifacts, limiting its clinical use in ophthalmology.

Method: The authors present a vision transformer-based approach trained on a hybrid dataset combining synthetic and experimental tear film data, enabling real-time reconstructions from dynamic interferograms.

Result: The model delivers state-of-the-art performance by resolving phase ambiguities and handling noise and motion artifacts effectively, achieving consistent film thickness reconstruction in real-time using standard hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances automated, real-time diagnostics for tear film thickness, facilitating continuous monitoring and diagnosis of ophthalmic conditions like dry eye disease.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

*Wenhao Zheng,Chenwei Sun,Wenbo Zhang,Jiancheng Lv,Xianggen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN), a framework that advances multi-modal parametric CAD sequence generation by addressing long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity. Evaluations show improved performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of sophisticated generative modeling techniques for multi-modal data like parametric CAD sequences, due to challenges such as long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity, has limited advancements in this domain.

Method: The authors propose TGBFN, a novel framework leveraging unified continuous and differentiable parameter space, along with a guided Bayesian flow mechanism, to address the complexities in generating CAD sequences under quantitative constraints.

Result: The evaluation utilized a newly constructed CAD dataset and demonstrated that TGBFN outperforms existing methods in generating high-fidelity CAD sequences under single-condition and multi-condition constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed TGBFN framework achieves state-of-the-art results in quantitatively constrained multi-modal parametric CAD generation, overcoming existing challenges while establishing a new benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

*Kejing Xia,Jidong Jia,Ke Jin,Yucai Bai,Li Sun,Dacheng Tao,Youjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The proposed D2GS framework enables LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction with enhanced accuracy, leveraging dense metric depth predictions and innovative refinement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction approaches require accurate LiDAR data, which is difficult to obtain due to challenges like spatiotemporal calibration and spatial misalignment with other sensors.

Method: D2GS replaces LiDAR geometry priors by creating dense point clouds through multi-view metric depth predictions, refining them with Progressive Pruning, Depth Enhancer using diffusion priors, and enhancing ground-plane geometry.

Result: D2GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in urban scene reconstruction, achieving better geometry even compared to methods using true LiDAR data, as validated on the Waymo dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction is feasible using advanced depth estimation and refinement techniques, providing a practical alternative to LiDAR-reliant methods.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) to address issues with class imbalance and fixed parameter classifiers in semantic segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional semantic segmentation classifiers use fixed parameters that fail to adapt to individual image characteristics and class imbalances within datasets.

Method: The authors propose ECAC, which dynamically adjusts its classifier using global (dataset-level) and local (image-level) contextual information. It incorporates a memory bank to store dataset-level class context and utilizes a teacher-student network paradigm for knowledge transfer and adjustment.

Result: ECAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Conclusion: Dynamically adaptive classifiers like ECAC improve the robustness and accuracy of semantic segmentation by addressing individual image context and dataset-level class imbalances.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

*Yingjie Gao,Yanan Zhang,Zhi Cai,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates dependency on source data and closed-set limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current test-time adaptive object detection methods which rely on source-derived statistical characteristics and assume identical category spaces between source and target domains.

Method: The paper proposes a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework, using text and visual prompt tuning, a Test-time Warm-start strategy for visual prompts, and an Instance Dynamic Memory module with strategies for enhancing predictions and hallucinating images.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: This method enables effective domain adaptation in real-world scenarios for object detection, overcoming source data dependency and adapting to cross-domain and cross-category data.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

### [146] [U-CAN: Unsupervised Point Cloud Denoising with Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25210)
*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces U-CAN, an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving performance comparable to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of noisy point clouds affecting downstream tasks like surface reconstruction, and to eliminate the need for large-scale manually-labeled data for supervised denoising.

Method: The authors propose U-CAN, which leverages a neural network for multi-step denoising using a noise-to-noise matching scheme, employing a novel loss function for reasoning across noisy observations and a constraint on denoised geometry consistency.

Result: U-CAN significantly improves over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and achieves comparable results to supervised methods in tasks like point cloud denoising and upsampling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in addressing point cloud noise without requiring ground-truth data and has broader applicability to domains like 2D image denoising.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Net is introduced as a novel framework to improve surface normal estimation in photometric stereo by better feature extraction and interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo models struggle with capturing multi-stage features and promoting their interaction, leading to poor performance in complex areas such as wrinkles and edges.

Method: MSF-Net utilizes a selective update strategy for extracting multi-stage features and incorporates a feature fusion module to enhance feature interplay.

Result: MSF-Net achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation on the DiLiGenT benchmark.

Conclusion: The new MSF-Net framework dramatically improves surface normal estimation by addressing limitations in feature extraction and interaction of previous models.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

TL;DR: A new framework for Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in medical image segmentation is proposed, using hard sample selection and denoised patch mixing for better target distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ignoring sample difficulty and noisy supervision under domain shifts in SFDA for medical image segmentation.

Method: Introduced a progressive adaptation framework involving entropy-similarity partitioning for reliable sample selection, Monte Carlo-based denoising masks for pseudo-label refinement, and patch mixing strategies for transferring reliable semantics.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, with improvements in segmentation accuracy, particularly in boundary delineation, measured by Dice and ASSD scores.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation and denoised supervision are crucial for robust medical image segmentation under domain shift in SFDA.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved rectified flow model leveraging real images in the training process, significantly reducing dependency on large quantities of generated data while enhancing image generation quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges faced by rectified flow generative models, including high computational costs due to reliance on large generative pairs and the bias caused by relying solely on generated image pairs during training.

Method: The proposed method incorporates real images into the rectified flow training process to reduce dependency on large sets of generated data and ensure efficient reflow using smaller datasets. This maintains smooth ODE paths by leveraging real data.

Result: The proposed approach achieved improved FID scores on CIFAR-10 compared to the original method, with better results in one-step generation and full-step simulations while only requiring a smaller number of generative pairs.

Conclusion: Incorporating real images in the training process leads to enhanced robustness of ODE learning, reduced bias toward generated data, and more efficient and effective generative modeling in rectified flow-based models.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

### [150] [Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25234)
*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative method to generate realistic and expressive 3D facial animations driven by speech and emotion using blendshapes and datasets, addressing a lack of expressive 3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to generate emotionally expressive and realistic 3D talking faces arises from the growing demand for high-quality AI-generated facial animations, coupled with the challenge of obtaining emotional 3D datasets.

Method: The method models facial animation using speech and emotion as additive factors. It uses two datasets—VOCAset with neutral expressions and Florence4D with emotion-based expression sequences—and employs blendshape learning and a sparsity constraint loss for disentanglement.

Result: The proposed approach generates talking faces with specified emotional expressions while maintaining precise lip synchronization. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the model's performance and emotional expressivity.

Conclusion: This study successfully creates a system for expressive and realistic talking face animations, enabling superior emotion depiction without sacrificing lip-sync quality. It highlights advancements in AI-driven facial animation solutions.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepShield is a framework for robust deepfake detection, excelling in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations by combining local and global analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of deep generative models for manipulating face videos poses security and ethical challenges. Current detection methods fail to generalize effectively across diverse manipulation techniques.

Method: DeepShield features two core components: Local Patch Guidance (LPG) for fine-grained artifact modeling, and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) for domain feature augmentation, both enhancing detection adaptability.

Result: DeepShield surpasses state-of-the-art detectors in robustness, showcasing superior performance in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The integration of local patch sensitivity with global feature diversification in DeepShield effectively strengthens deepfake detection against unseen forgery techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning models for classifying trees outside forests using high-resolution aerial imagery in Germany, achieving good accuracy with FT-UNetFormer standing out.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on trees outside forests have limitations in ecological interpretation due to single-class approaches or rigid rule-based thresholds, prompting the need for adaptable deep learning techniques.

Method: Deep learning approaches including CNNs, vision transformers, and hybrid models are tested across six architectures to classify woody vegetation categories using a new dataset and aerial imagery.

Result: FT-UNetFormer demonstrated the best classification performance with high IoU and F1 scores, though challenges remain in mapping complex structures like patches and individual trees.

Conclusion: Regionally diverse training data are critical for reliable large-scale mapping, and the models exhibit potential in enhancing TOF classification and ecological understanding.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distillation framework using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object detectors without increasing inference overhead, achieving improved detection speeds and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for high-speed real-time object detection degrade feature representation, limiting performance and practicality for on-device usage. Addressing stable and effective semantic transfer from VFMs to constrained detectors motivated this work.

Method: The paper proposes a framework with a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) for high-level representation integration and a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy to dynamically control semantic transfer intensity based on gradient norm ratios.

Result: The framework improves lightweight object detectors consistently and achieves state-of-the-art performance across DETR-based models with AP scores of 49.7-57.0 at speeds of 78-273 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed RT-DETRv4 model family demonstrates the practical utility for high-speed real-time object detection, delivering notable performance enhancements without additional deployment or inference overhead.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

TL;DR: LangHOPS introduces a novel framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation, utilizing a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate language-guided hierarchical detection and segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods in hierarchical object-part instance segmentation that rely on heuristic or visual grouping, by utilizing a language-enhanced framework for better understanding and segmentation.

Method: LangHOPS combines multimodal large language models into the object-part parsing pipeline, using language grounding for object-part hierarchies and integrating multi-granularity concept linkages. It evaluates the system using scenarios like in-domain, cross-dataset, and zero-shot segmentation.

Result: LangHOPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins: 5.5% AP in-domain, 4.8% AP cross-dataset on PartImageNet, and 2.5% mIoU on unseen object parts in ADE20K for zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: The study showcases the effectiveness of language-grounded hierarchies and MLLM-driven refinement for object-part segmentation, offering a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM), a novel framework addressing source-free domain adaptation by generating and refining pseudo-target data using unlabeled target data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) face difficulties due to domain discrepancies, unreliable pseudo-labels, or degraded performance when generating pseudo-source data.

Method: DPTM utilizes unlabeled target data to generate and refine a pseudo-target domain through a trust and non-trust sample division, semantic transformation, latent diffusion models, and iterative refinement.

Result: Experimental results show DPTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark SFDA datasets, improving by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large domain gaps.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively mitigates the limitations of existing SFDA methods, highlighting its reliability and capability to address large domain disparities while achieving significant performance boosts.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ is a unified framework addressing gaze object detection and gaze following without relying on head-related priors, offering enhanced performance with novel mechanisms and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods separate gaze object detection and gaze following tasks while depending heavily on head-related prior knowledge, limiting optimization and practical usability.

Method: GaTector+ employs a feature extractor combining specific-general-specific design, integrates head detection, uses head-based attention for feature fusion, introduces attention supervision for improving gaze heatmap learning, and proposes a novel evaluation metric (mSoC).

Result: GaTector+ demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets for both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies gaze-related tasks without relying on head-related priors during inference, providing practical and optimized solutions for gaze interpretation.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight and plug-in approach for improving few-shot object detection (FSOD), addressing base-class bias and unstable calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in FSOD, such as base-class bias and unstable calibration, particularly when only a few novel samples are available.

Method: Introduces PDA, a plug-in metric head for models like DeFRCN, which uses prototype-based alignment and EMA-updated support-only prototypes in a learnable projection space. PDA ensures protocol compliance through frozen prototypes during inference and combines metric similarities with detector logits using multi-modality matching and temperature-scaled fusion.

Result: On VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks, PDA consistently enhances novel-class detection performance with minimal trade-off on base-class performance and low computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA effectively resolves core FSOD challenges, offering improved novel-class performance without harming base-class accuracy, and is computationally efficient, making it a promising addition to FSOD models.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

### [159] [MMEdge: Accelerating On-device Multimodal Inference via Pipelined Sensing and Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25327)
*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a novel framework for real-time, resource-efficient, multimodal inference on edge devices using pipelined computing, adaptive configuration, and speculative mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-time inference involving complex inter-modality dependencies and resource constraints in applications like autonomous driving or mobile health.

Method: MMEdge uses a pipelined sensing and encoding approach, temporal aggregation to capture dynamics, adaptive configuration for optimizing resources per modality, and speculative skipping for faster inference.

Result: MMEdge demonstrates significant reductions in latency and maintained task accuracy when tested on public datasets and deployed on a UAV testbed under dynamic resource conditions.

Conclusion: The MMEdge framework successfully enables efficient, adaptive, and accurate multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

### [160] [StreamingCoT: A Dataset for Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25332)
*Yuhang Hu,Zhenyu Yang,Shihan Wang,Shengsheng Qian,Bin Wen,Fan Yang,Tingting Gao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces StreamingCoT, a dataset aimed at enhancing temporally evolving reasoning in streaming video QA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets fail to address temporal evolution of answers and lack explicit reasoning annotations, which hampers interpretability and logical deduction capabilities.

Method: StreamingCoT implements dynamic hierarchical annotation for dense per-second descriptions, constructs temporally-dependent segments, and generates reasoning chains using semantic alignment and large language models validated by humans.

Result: The dataset enables improved temporal reasoning, spatiotemporal understanding, and multimodal inference in streaming video tasks.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT lays a foundation for advancing complex video understanding and reasoning capabilities in specialized applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be
accessed at https://github.com/Fleeting-hyh/StreamingCoT.

### [161] [Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25345)
*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition using active learning reformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance 3D action recognition with limited annotated skeletal sequences and reduce costly annotations, while improving the accuracy by intelligently selecting informative samples.

Method: The paper forms active learning for semi-supervised 3D action recognition as a Markov Decision Process. It uses hyperbolic space representation to enhance state-action pair capacity and introduces a meta tuning strategy for real-world adaptability.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: This approach addresses the challenge of selecting informative samples for annotation, improving efficiency and recognition outcomes in semi-supervised 3D action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

*Ayman Abaid,Gianpiero Guidone,Sara Alsubai,Foziyah Alquahtani,Talha Iqbal,Ruth Sharif,Hesham Elzomor,Emiliano Bianchini,Naeif Almagal,Michael G. Madden,Faisal Sharif,Ihsan Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a radiomics-based pipeline leveraging pseudo-labeling and pretrained models to classify coronary calcium scores using non-contrast CCTA scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease through reliable classification of calcium scores in non-contrast coronary CT scans.

Method: The pipeline uses pseudo-labeling to generate training labels, pretrained foundation models (CT-FM and RadImageNet) for feature extraction, and radiomics-based methods to classify scans into zero vs non-zero calcium scores.

Result: Radiomics-based models outperform CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models, achieving 84% classification accuracy on non-contrast CCTA datasets (p<0.05).

Conclusion: The radiomics pipeline proves effective for calcium score classification without needing expert annotations, outperforming CNN-derived features in accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

### [163] [Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt Tuning of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25372)
*M Yashwanth,Sharannya Ghosh,Aditay Tripathi,Anirban Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEP-FedPT, a federated learning framework using Vision Transformers for adaptive prompt tuning, aiming for both generalization and personalization while surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance federated learning efficiency in adapting large models to downstream tasks, addressing challenges of generalization and personalization on heterogeneous data.

Method: They designed PEP-FedPT with Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP), combining globally shared and class-specific prompts, personalized at the sample level via global and client class prototypes, using federated averaging.

Result: PEP-FedPT outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in evaluations on multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance under diverse data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT provides an efficient and generalizable framework for federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers, striking a balance between generalization and personalization.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

*Bill Psomas,George Retsinas,Nikos Efthymiadis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Yannis Avrithis,Petros Maragos,Ondrej Chum,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) due to inadequate datasets. It introduces i-CIR, a focused instance-level evaluation dataset, and proposes BASIC, a training-free retrieval method using pre-trained vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Composed Image Retrieval suffers from limited progress due to the lack of high-quality training and evaluation datasets. The authors aim to fill this gap by proposing an advanced evaluation dataset and improving retrieval methods.

Method: The authors introduce i-CIR, a compact, instance-level evaluation dataset with challenging retrieval tasks. They also propose BASIC, a training-free approach using late fusion of query-image and query-text similarities leveraging pre-trained vision-language models.

Result: The BASIC method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the proposed i-CIR dataset and existing CIR datasets.

Conclusion: i-CIR improves evaluation and training realism in CIR. BASIC offers a robust, training-free solution, setting new benchmarks for CIR research using pre-trained models.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

### [165] [More than a Moment: Towards Coherent Sequences of Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25440)
*Eshika Khandelwal,Junyu Xie,Tengda Han,Max Bain,Arsha Nagrani,Andrew Zisserman,Gül Varol,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method for generating coherent Audio Descriptions (ADs) for visually impaired audiences using auto-regressive selection and multiple candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing automatic AD methods, which often produce repetitive and incoherent descriptions by generating ADs independently.

Method: CoherentAD first generates multiple candidate ADs for each interval, followed by auto-regressive selection to create a coherent sequence. It also introduces a sequence-level metric called StoryRecall to measure narrative coherence and additional metrics to check redundancy.

Result: The method generates more coherent and informative AD sequences, demonstrating improved narrative understanding compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: CoherentAD successfully addresses the issues of incoherence and repetition in automatic AD generation, establishing a novel framework for creating narrative-rich AD sequences.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

*Doan-Van-Anh Ly,Thi-Thu-Hien Pham,Thanh-Hai Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates liver tumor segmentation in CT images using UNet-based architectures, finding that ResNet-based models with CBAM achieve the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate liver structure segmentation in CT images is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, including tumor detection.

Method: The study evaluates UNet-based architectures extended with ResNet, Transformer, and Mamba backbones (using pretrained weights), and incorporates attention mechanisms like CBAM for enhanced segmentation quality.

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved the highest Dice score (0.755), IoU (0.662), precision in boundary delineation (HD95: 77.911), overall accuracy (0.925), and specificity (0.926).

Conclusion: Combining classical ResNet architectures with attention mechanisms like CBAM is highly competitive, offering robust performance in liver tumor detection and segmentation for clinical applications.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RegionE, a framework for accelerating instruction-based image editing (IIE) tasks by region-aware generation without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IIE models use a uniform generation process for the entire image, ignoring differences in complexity and redundancy between edited and unedited regions.

Method: RegionE includes Adaptive Region Partition, Region-Aware Generation, and Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache, which focus on efficient denoising and computational optimization for specific regions.

Result: RegionE applied to several state-of-the-art IIE models achieved acceleration factors ranging from 2.06 to 2.57 while maintaining high semantic and perceptual fidelity.

Conclusion: RegionE provides faster and highly accurate image editing by utilizing region-specific approaches, significantly improving efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autoregressive image generation models produce high-quality images but are slow; this paper proposes Hawk, a new method to accelerate image generation using spatial structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation deliver high-quality outputs but are limited by the slow token-by-token decoding process.

Method: The paper introduces Hawk, which uses the spatial structure inherent in images for speculative decoding, improving alignment between draft and target models.

Result: Hawk achieves a notable 1.71x speedup over conventional AR models while maintaining image fidelity and diversity in text-to-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: Harnessing spatial structures in image generation can significantly improve the efficiency of autoregressive models without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of systematic reviews and benchmarks for multimodal spatial reasoning models.

Method: The paper categorizes existing progress in spatial reasoning tasks, focusing on architecture, explainability, and emerging modalities.

Result: The review establishes a foundation for multimodal spatial reasoning by summarizing tasks, advancements, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: This survey highlights the importance of multimodal spatial reasoning and provides benchmarks and resources for further development.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: FreeArt3D introduces a training-free framework for generating articulated 3D objects using pre-trained static 3D diffusion models, optimizing geometry, texture, and articulation parameters in minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling articulated 3D objects are limited either by requiring dense-view supervision or focusing on coarse geometry lacking textured detail. There is a need for fast, versatile, and high-quality generation of such objects.

Method: FreeArt3D repurposes pre-trained static 3D diffusion models, like Trellis, as shape priors. It extends Score Distillation Sampling into the 3D-to-4D domain to incorporate articulation as a generative factor, optimizing geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without additional training.

Result: FreeArt3D achieves high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts kinematic structures, and generalizes across diverse objects. It significantly outperforms prior methods in quality and versatility, completing process within minutes.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D demonstrates the feasibility of generating textured and articulated 3D objects efficiently without task-specific training, advancing capabilities in robotics, AR/VR, and animation.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a framework for VFX video generation using in-context learning, surpassing current resource-intensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating visual effects in digital media is a challenge for generative AI due to scalability and generalization constraints.

Method: VFXMaster uses in-context conditioning and attention masking along with one-shot effect adaptation to achieve unified and generalizable VFX generation.

Result: VFXMaster effectively replicates diverse visual effects, generalizes to unseen categories, and demonstrates efficiency in tough scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for VFX creation with unified models, and the authors aim to foster research by providing open-source resources.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

### [172] [Radar DataTree: A FAIR and Cloud-Native Framework for Scalable Weather Radar Archives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24943)
*Alfonso Ladino-Rincon,Stephen W. Nesbitt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Radar DataTree introduces a framework for organizing, optimizing, and processing radar weather data while adhering to FAIR principles, facilitating reproducibility and large-scale research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar data are available publicly but remain fragmented, vendor-specific, and underutilized. There is a need for better alignment with FAIR principles to enhance research reproducibility and computational efficiency.

Method: The study leverages the FM-301/CfRadial 2.1 standard, implements a metadata-rich hierarchical structure using xarray DataTree, and serializes data with Zarr. It uses Icechunk for storage, enabling scalable, parallel computation.

Result: The framework achieved significant performance improvements in workflows like Quasi-Vertical Profile (QVP) and precipitation accumulation. Tools and datasets are openly released via Raw2Zarr.

Conclusion: Radar DataTree enhances radar data usability through an open-source, cloud-optimized architecture, offering a scalable solution for geoscience research and AI-ready weather data frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Radar DataTree, the first dataset-level framework that extends
the WMO FM-301 standard from individual radar volume scans to time-resolved,
analysis-ready archives. Weather radar data are among the most scientifically
valuable yet structurally underutilized Earth observation datasets. Despite
widespread public availability, radar archives remain fragmented,
vendor-specific, and poorly aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) principles, hindering large-scale research,
reproducibility, and cloud-native computation. Radar DataTree addresses these
limitations with a scalable, open-source architecture that transforms
operational radar archives into FAIR-compliant, cloud-optimized datasets. Built
on the FM-301/CfRadial 2.1 standard and implemented using xarray DataTree,
Radar DataTree organizes radar volume scans as hierarchical, metadata-rich
structures and serializes them to Zarr for scalable analysis. Coupled with
Icechunk for ACID-compliant storage and versioning, this architecture enables
efficient, parallel computation across thousands of radar scans with minimal
preprocessing. We demonstrate significant performance gains in case studies
including Quasi-Vertical Profile (QVP) and precipitation accumulation
workflows, and release all tools and datasets openly via the Raw2Zarr
repository. This work contributes a reproducible and extensible foundation for
radar data stewardship, high-performance geoscience, and AI-ready weather
infrastructure.

### [173] [Multi-Resolution Model Fusion for Accelerating the Convolutional Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25170)
*Kewei Wang,Claire Songhyun Lee,Sunwoo Lee,Vishu Gupta,Jan Balewski,Alex Sim,Peter Nugent,Ankit Agrawal,Alok Choudhary,Kesheng Wu,Wei-keng Liao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-Resolution Model Fusion (MRMF), which reduces neural network training time by using lower-resolution data and models before refinement with high-resolution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost of training neural networks on large, high-dimensional datasets can be prohibitive, necessitating efficient training methodologies.

Method: The authors propose a Multi-Resolution Model Fusion (MRMF) approach, where models are first trained on reduced-resolution data and then refined using original high-resolution data to ensure accuracy.

Result: The MRMF method demonstrated a training time reduction of up to 47% for CosmoFlow and 44% for Neuron Inverter applications, without any loss in model accuracy.

Conclusion: MRMF is an effective approach to significantly lower training time while maintaining model accuracy, particularly in applications with large datasets.

Abstract: Neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in scientific research, but
training the models is often very time-consuming. Particularly when the
training data samples are large high-dimensional arrays, efficient training
methodologies that can reduce the computational costs are crucial. To reduce
the training cost, we propose a Multi-Resolution Model Fusion (MRMF) method
that combines models trained on reduced-resolution data and then refined with
data in the original resolution. We demonstrate that these reduced-resolution
models and datasets could be generated quickly. More importantly, the proposed
approach reduces the training time by speeding up the model convergence in each
fusion stage before switching to the final stage of finetuning with data in its
original resolution. This strategy ensures the final model retains
high-resolution insights while benefiting from the computational efficiency of
lower-resolution training. Our experiment results demonstrate that the
multi-resolution model fusion method can significantly reduce end-to-end
training time while maintaining the same model accuracy. Evaluated using two
real-world scientific applications, CosmoFlow and Neuron Inverter, the proposed
method improves the training time by up to 47% and 44%, respectively, as
compared to the original resolution training, while the model accuracy is not
affected.

### [174] [MoEntwine: Unleashing the Potential of Wafer-scale Chips for Large-scale Expert Parallel Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25258)
*Xinru Tang,Jingxiang Hou,Dingcheng Jiang,Taiquan Wei,Jiaxin Liu,Jinyi Deng,Huizheng Wang,Qize Yang,Haoran Shang,Chao Li,Yang Hu,Shouyi Yin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces strategies to optimize mixture-of-experts (MoE) models' performance on wafer-scale chips, addressing challenges in communication and disk migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of GPU clusters for MoE models and leverage the potential of wafer-scale chips with their unified high-performance network.

Method: Proposed Entwined Ring Mapping (ER-Mapping) to balance communication pressure and Non-invasive Balancer (NI-Balancer) for reducing expert migration overhead.

Result: ER-Mapping reduced communication by 62%, while NI-Balancer improved MoE computation by 54% and communication efficiency by 22%.

Conclusion: Wafer-scale chips with ER-Mapping and NI-Balancer offer 39% higher per-device MoE performance compared to state-of-the-art GPU systems like NVL72 supernode, demonstrating better scalability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale up, mixture-of-experts
(MoE) has become a common technology in SOTA models. MoE models rely on expert
parallelism (EP) to alleviate memory bottleneck, which introduces all-to-all
communication to dispatch and combine tokens across devices. However, in
widely-adopted GPU clusters, high-overhead cross-node communication makes
all-to-all expensive, hindering the adoption of EP. Recently, wafer-scale chips
(WSCs) have emerged as a platform integrating numerous devices on a wafer-sized
interposer. WSCs provide a unified high-performance network connecting all
devices, presenting a promising potential for hosting MoE models. Yet, their
network is restricted to a mesh topology, causing imbalanced communication
pressure and performance loss. Moreover, the lack of on-wafer disk leads to
high-overhead expert migration on the critical path.
  To fully unleash this potential, we first propose Entwined Ring Mapping
(ER-Mapping), which co-designs the mapping of attention and MoE layers to
balance communication pressure and achieve better performance. We find that
under ER-Mapping, the distribution of cold and hot links in the attention and
MoE layers is complementary. Therefore, to hide the migration overhead, we
propose the Non-invasive Balancer (NI-Balancer), which splits a complete expert
migration into multiple steps and alternately utilizes the cold links of both
layers. Evaluation shows ER-Mapping achieves communication reduction up to 62%.
NI-Balancer further delivers 54% and 22% improvements in MoE computation and
communication, respectively. Compared with the SOTA NVL72 supernode, the WSC
platform delivers an average 39% higher per-device MoE performance owing to its
scalability to larger EP.

### [175] [A Privacy-Preserving Ecosystem for Developing Machine Learning Algorithms Using Patient Data: Insights from the TUM.ai Makeathon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25277)
*Simon Süwer,Mai Khanh Mai,Christoph Klein,Nicola Götzenberger,Denis Dalić,Andreas Maier,Jan Baumbach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-stage secure AI training approach using a clinical knowledge graph (cKG) and federated learning to overcome GDPR restrictions, enabling safe use of sensitive medical data for AI model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of using sensitive clinical data for personalized medicine due to GDPR restrictions, particularly for small cohorts or rare diseases. High-quality structured data is required for predictive medical AI development.

Method: The method involves a four-stage secure AI training process: designing a model on a simulated cKG, integrating it into the FeatureCloud federated learning framework, training within a secure hospital environment under supervision or automation, and executing verified evaluation scripts to provide aggregated metrics without exposing sensitive data.

Result: The approach was successfully tested during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 challenge, where 50 students created models for patient classification and diagnosis without real data. This validated the privacy-preserving method.

Conclusion: Employing secure algorithms using federated frameworks, such as the FC framework, offers a scalable solution for privacy-preserving AI in healthcare, enabling personalized medicine while ensuring data protection.

Abstract: The integration of clinical data offers significant potential for the
development of personalized medicine. However, its use is severely restricted
by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts
with rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the
development of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel,
multi-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a
simulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to
represent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any
sensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC)
federated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client
configuration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes
place within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct
supervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by
the hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only
return aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance
feedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the
clinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a
cKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context
of real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated
during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner
Children's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient
classification and diagnosis without access to real data. Deploying secure
algorithms via federated frameworks, such as the FC framework, could be a
practical way of achieving privacy-preserving AI in healthcare.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper discusses effective scheduling techniques for complex data-intensive workloads on large-scale distributed resources, addressing challenges like data locality, QoS requirements, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of big data has resulted in complex and computationally demanding workloads processed on distributed systems, requiring effective scheduling to address challenges like data locality, time constraints, failure resilience, and energy efficiency.

Method: The paper classifies data-intensive workloads and summarizes common scheduling approaches for large-scale distributed systems, alongside presenting novel strategies and future research directions.

Result: A comprehensive review of scheduling techniques and a categorization of data-intensive workloads are provided, along with insights into emerging approaches.

Conclusion: Effective scheduling is crucial for handling data-intensive workloads in distributed systems, but the field faces several challenges and open areas for further study.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of big data, workloads tend to get more complex and
computationally demanding. Such applications are processed on distributed
interconnected resources that are becoming larger in scale and computational
capacity. Data-intensive applications may have different degrees of parallelism
and must effectively exploit data locality. Furthermore, they may impose
several Quality of Service requirements, such as time constraints and
resilience against failures, as well as other objectives, like energy
efficiency. These features of the workloads, as well as the inherent
characteristics of the computing resources required to process them, present
major challenges that require the employment of effective scheduling
techniques. In this chapter, a classification of data-intensive workloads is
proposed and an overview of the most commonly used approaches for their
scheduling in large-scale distributed systems is given. We present novel
strategies that have been proposed in the literature and shed light on open
challenges and future directions.

### [177] [Can Like Attract Like? A Study of Homonymous Gathering in Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25451)
*Stéphane Devismes,Yoann Dieudonné,Arnaud Labourel*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores the gathering problem in distributed mobile systems where agents aim to convene at the same node, focusing on deterministic solutions with agents having possibly non-unique labels. It provides a characterization of gatherable teams, a polynomial-time gathering algorithm, and optimally demonstrates its efficiency concerning common knowledge bits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses whether deterministic gathering is achievable for agents with potentially non-unique labels in networks, moving beyond the assumption of pairwise distinct IDs to enable broader applicability in practical settings.

Method: The authors characterize gatherable teams, design a synchronized deterministic gathering algorithm with poly$(n,\log\lambda)$ complexity, and optimize the dependency on shared common knowledge. They tackle termination detection for multi-agent teams, which was previously only resolved for two agents.

Result: The paper achieves the first deterministic poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time algorithm requiring no common knowledge for gathering with distinct labels and extends it to teams with shared labels by utilizing minimal bits of shared information.

Conclusion: The research advances distributed mobile system capabilities by enabling deterministic gathering for teams with shared labels, solving a longstanding challenge in termination detection, and optimizing efficiency in knowledge sharing and algorithm complexity.

Abstract: A team of mobile agents, starting from distinct nodes of a network, have to
meet at the same node and declare that they all met. Agents execute the same
algorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent
entering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the
network in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly
local. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed
mobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity,
i.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent
and the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions
typically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known
only to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee
deterministic gathering?
  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label.
A team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is
an algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give
a full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm
that gathers all of them in poly$(n,\log\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp.
$\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm
requires the agents to initially share only $O(\log \log \log \mu)$ bits of
common knowledge, where $\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We
show this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time
complexity.
  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time
algorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are
distinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any
team size faced a major challenge: termination detection. Our techniques to
address it may be of independent interest.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Holon Streaming is introduced to address scalability, latency, and failure issues in global aggregations within exactly-once stream processing systems by utilizing Windowed CRDTs for decentralized coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stream processing systems struggle with scalability and bottlenecks in global aggregations due to centralized approaches and static aggregation trees.

Method: The proposed system uses a deterministic programming model with Windowed CRDTs, a new abstraction for scalable and shared replicated state, enabling decentralized coordination and efficient failure recovery.

Result: Holon Streaming achieves a 5x lower latency and 2x higher throughput, along with an 11x latency reduction under failure scenarios compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: The implementation of Windowed CRDTs proves effective for scalability, latency reduction, and fault tolerance in global aggregations; showing the advantages of decentralized coordination.

Abstract: Scaling global aggregations is a challenge for exactly-once stream processing
systems. Current systems implement these either by computing the aggregation in
a single task instance, or by static aggregation trees, which limits
scalability and may become a bottleneck. Moreover, the end-to-end latency is
determined by the slowest path in the tree, and failures and reconfiguration
cause large latency spikes due to the centralized coordination. Towards these
issues, we present Holon Streaming, an exactly-once stream processing system
for global aggregations. Its deterministic programming model uses windowed
conflict-free replicated data types (Windowed CRDTs), a novel abstraction for
shared replicated state. Windowed CRDTs make computing global aggregations
scalable. Furthermore, their guarantees such as determinism and convergence
enable the design of efficient failure recovery algorithms by decentralized
coordination. Our evaluation shows a 5x lower latency and 2x higher throughput
than an existing stream processing system on global aggregation workloads, with
an 11x latency reduction under failure scenarios. The paper demonstrates the
effectiveness of decentralized coordination with determinism, and the utility
of Windowed CRDTs for global aggregations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of Fortytwo protocol using swarm inference for distributed AI with higher accuracy, resilience against attacks, and reliable decentralized AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of centralized AI systems including compute ceilings and diminishing returns by utilizing decentralized, swarm-based inference.

Method: Fortytwo leverages swarm intelligence and distributed pairwise ranking consensus using a reputation-weighted approach with a Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model.

Result: Achieved notable performance improvements such as 85.90% accuracy on GPQA Diamond compared to 68.69% via majority voting, improved resilience against attacks (e.g., minimal degradation against prompt-injection).

Conclusion: The paper establishes a pathway for decentralized AI systems providing higher quality inference, robustness, and security while democratizing AI access.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

TL;DR: This paper formally analyzes weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN to a ReLU CNN using structured data and gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms and regimes where weak-to-strong generalization occurs to refine the performance of stronger models.

Method: A formal analysis of gradient descent dynamics on structured data with label-dependent signals and noise, distinguishing data-scarce and data-abundant regimes.

Result: Weak-to-strong generalization mechanisms vary by regime: benign/harmful overfitting in data-scarce cases, and early label correction followed by degradation in data-abundant settings.

Conclusion: The paper highlights distinct patterns of generalization across regimes and the complexity of overfitting effects in training stronger models.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack detailed topographical information of fitness landscapes, making interpretation and comparison of machine learning-based fitness models challenging.

Method: GraphFLA computes 20 biologically relevant features from mutagenesis data to describe landscape topography across multiple modalities such as DNA, RNA, and protein.

Result: GraphFLA provided insights into the performance and influencing factors of fitness prediction models, using empirical data from over 5,300 landscapes and 2.2 million sequences.

Conclusion: GraphFLA improves the evaluation and comparison of fitness prediction models and offers significant resources, including combinatorially complete datasets, to the research community.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates IoT and AI to address environmental monitoring challenges using energy-efficient Tiny Machine Learning on microcontrollers, highlighting significant energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle pressing environmental challenges by creating effective, energy-efficient remote monitoring solutions using IoT devices in remote areas with limited power availability.

Method: The authors used compressed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on domain-specific datasets and evaluated them on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller, leveraging Tiny Machine Learning techniques.

Result: The study showed up to a fivefold reduction in energy consumption by performing on-device CNN inference and transmitting only results instead of raw data.

Conclusion: Incorporating Embedded Machine Learning into IoT nodes enables low-carbon, autonomous environmental monitoring in remote areas, balancing energy efficiency with performance.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

TL;DR: The paper addresses resource-efficient and robust inference for neural networks by combining algorithmic advancements and hardware innovation, focusing on compression, approximate Bayesian inference, and analog accelerators to enhance scalability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to overcome computational inefficiencies and improve the reliability of neural networks, especially on embedded and resource-constrained platforms, while maintaining robust predictions under distributional changes.

Method: It employs a dual strategy of algorithmic efficiency through model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, alongside hardware efficiency achieved via digital and analog accelerators. This includes automatic compression using sensitivity analysis, optimization of noisy hardware, analytic approximations for probabilistic inference, and utilization of controlled analog noise in hardware.

Result: The study achieves advancements in resource-efficient neural network inference, improved robustness for noisy accelerators, optimized embedded probabilistic inference, and introduces probabilistic photonic computing as a novel hardware-based inference approach.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that algorithm-hardware co-design can effectively merge efficiency and reliability, presenting innovation in trustworthy and energy-efficient machine-learning systems.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

### [184] [Aggregation Hides Out-of-Distribution Generalization Failures from Spurious Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24884)
*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmarks often show 'accuracy-on-the-line' between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. However, this correlation is misleading, as subsets reveal inverse relationships in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of 'accuracy-on-the-line' correlation and uncover instances where high ID accuracy leads to low OOD performance.

Method: The paper utilizes a gradient-based method called OODSelect to identify subsets of examples in established OOD benchmarks.

Result: OODSelect reveals subsets within benchmarks where the positive correlation breaks down, highlighting failure modes in OOD robustness.

Conclusion: Aggregate metrics mask critical weaknesses in OOD performance, and the study provides tools for more nuanced evaluation and further research.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further

### [185] [Dynamically Weighted Momentum with Adaptive Step Sizes for Efficient Deep Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25042)
*Zhifeng Wang,Longlong Li,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DWMGrad, a novel optimization algorithm for deep learning that builds on traditional methods but uses historical data for dynamic momentum and learning rate adjustments to address issues in non-convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper arises from the limitations of commonly used optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam in handling complex models, non-convex optimization challenges, and fluctuating learning efficiency.

Method: DWMGrad is proposed as a solution, which incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism based on historical data to flexibly update momentum and learning rates, addressing adaptive learning needs.

Result: Results from extensive experiments show that DWMGrad outperforms existing methods by achieving faster convergence rates and higher accuracies across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DWMGrad effectively addresses the challenges associated with optimization in deep learning and validates its efficiency and adaptability through experiments.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

### [186] [Adaptive EEG-based stroke diagnosis with a GRU-TCN classifier and deep Q-learning thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24889)
*Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu,Andrea Yang,Khartik Uppalapati,Aneesh Gudipati,Zhaoyang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an innovative EEG-based multitask classifier for rapid triage of stroke cases, achieving significant accuracy improvements through adaptive thresholding with a deep Q-network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a bedside-deployable, accurate tool for rapid stroke detection, leveraging underutilized EEG data to improve diagnostics at the first point of contact.

Method: The method involves converting EEG data to power spectral density features, employing a GRU-TCN-based classifier for simultaneous prediction of stroke type, lateralization, and severity, and using a deep Q-network for real-time threshold adaptation.

Result: The classifier achieved 89.3% accuracy for stroke type prediction, which improved to 98.0% with threshold adaptation, alongside high accuracy for severity (96.9%) and lateralization (96.7%). Robustness tests on an independent cohort confirmed efficacy.

Conclusion: Adaptive multitask EEG classifiers combined with real-time threshold tuning offer an effective and interpretable approach for stroke triage, with clinically preferred sensitivity and specificity trade-offs.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

### [187] [Position: Biology is the Challenge Physics-Informed ML Needs to Evolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25368)
*Julien Martinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML), an adaptation of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), designed to address the unique challenges of biological modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transition the success of PIML in physics-related domains to biology, while addressing the specific complexities and constraints inherent to biological systems.

Method: The authors propose BIML as a principled extension of PIML, incorporating probabilistic prior knowledge and focusing on four pillars: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.

Result: The paper emphasizes that BIML adapts PIML to biological challenges and highlights the role of Foundation and Large Language Models in bridging human expertise with computational methods.

Conclusion: BIML represents an evolution of PIML, aimed specifically at contributing to high-impact biological and societal challenges, and is supported by a roadmap to build and expand this framework.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

### [188] [Topic Analysis with Side Information: A Neural-Augmented LDA Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24918)
*Biyi Fang,Kripa Rajshekhar,Truong Vo,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Traditional LDA topic models struggle to incorporate auxiliary information. nnLDA is proposed as a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model to integrate side information dynamically, improving performance in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topic models often face limitations like not effectively integrating metadata, user attributes, or labels, restricting expressiveness and interpretability. This gap drives the development of nnLDA.

Method: nnLDA uses a neural prior mechanism to incorporate auxiliary features dynamically. A neural network generates prior topic proportions based on side information, and a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm jointly optimizes the neural and probabilistic components.

Result: nnLDA consistently outperforms traditional LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression across benchmark datasets in coherence, perplexity, and classification tasks.

Conclusion: Combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling enables better utilization of auxiliary information, enhancing overall model performance and applicability.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

### [189] [KAN-GCN: Combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Graph Convolution Network for an Accurate Ice Sheet Emulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24926)
*Zesheng Liu,YoungHyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAN-GCN, an advanced emulator for ice sheet modeling that enhances feature conditioning and nonlinear encoding via Kolmogorov-Arnold Network as a preprocess to Graph Convolutional Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve numerical ice sheet modeling efficiency and accuracy, especially in large transient scenario analysis.

Method: The method combines KAN as a feature-wise calibrator with GCNs, employing learnable warping and a mixing step to enhance feature encoding, tested on Pine Island Glacier melting-rate simulations.

Result: KAN-GCN outperforms GCN and MLP-GCN baselines across various architectures and mesh sizes, offering better throughput for coarse meshes with minimal overhead on fine meshes.

Conclusion: KAN-GCN offers a promising accuracy-efficiency trade-off for ice sheet modeling emulators, optimizing simulations with improved functionality over existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

### [190] [WBT-BGRL: A Non-Contrastive Weighted Bipartite Link Prediction Model for Inductive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24927)
*Joel Frank Huarayo Quispe,Lilian Berton,Didier Vega-Oliveros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WBT-BGRL, a non-contrastive weighted learning framework for link prediction in bipartite graphs, outperforming alternative methods in real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in bipartite link prediction, including inefficiencies in negative sampling by contrastive approaches and the limitations of exclusively positive-sample-based methods.

Method: Develop WBT-BGRL, a non-contrastive approach with a novel triplet loss weighting mechanism and dual GCN encoders for effective bipartite link prediction.

Result: WBT-BGRL demonstrates competitive performance on Industry and E-commerce datasets, particularly when weighting is applied during pretraining.

Conclusion: Weighted, non-contrastive methods like WBT-BGRL offer strong potential for inductive link prediction in bipartite graphs, showing improved efficiency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

### [191] [Localized Kernel Projection Outlyingness: A Two-Stage Approach for Multi-Modal Outlier Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24043)
*Akira Tamamori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-Stage LKPLO is a novel framework for outlier detection that overcomes the limitations of projection-based methods using a multi-stage architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional projection-based methods rely on fixed statistical metrics and assume single data structures, limiting their effectiveness for complex and multi-structured datasets.

Method: The framework incorporates a loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) with adaptive loss functions, applies global kernel PCA for data linearization, and uses local clustering for handling multi-modal distributions.

Result: Experimental results on 10 benchmark datasets show that Two-Stage LKPLO surpasses state-of-the-art methods, especially for multi-cluster and high-dimensional data. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of its hybrid stages.

Conclusion: Two-Stage LKPLO provides an effective solution for challenging outlier detection problems and highlights the value of multi-stage architectural designs.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

### [192] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recent findings reveal that many reasoning steps in LLMs' Chain-of-Thought (CoT) do not have a causal impact on the final prediction, and only a small subset truly contributes to the output. A new True Thinking Score (TTS) measures this step-wise causal influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the fidelity and efficiency of reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs), particularly their reliance on verbalized reasoning steps in the Chain-of-Thought process.

Method: The research introduces the True Thinking Score (TTS) to measure the step-wise causal influence of reasoning steps in CoT on LLM predictions. The study also identifies a latent TrueThinking direction within LLMs’ representation space, enabling targeted steering to influence reasoning steps and outcomes.

Result: The analysis finds that only a small fraction of CoT reasoning steps causally drive LLM predictions, with decorative-thinking steps often overshadowing true-thinking ones. Steering along the identified TrueThinking direction can enforce internal processing or bypass unfaithful CoT steps, altering predictions.

Conclusion: LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps that do not reflect genuine internal computations, indicating inefficiencies and trust issues with CoT. The TrueThinking framework provides potential for more faithful reasoning and improved monitoring of LLM behaviors.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

### [193] [Finding Culture-Sensitive Neurons in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24942)
*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vision-language models struggle with culturally grounded inputs. This study identifies and analyzes culture-sensitive neurons within the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vision-language models process culturally grounded information and improve their handling of diverse cultural inputs.

Method: Using the CVQA benchmark, they identify culture-selective neurons and analyze them through causal tests and propose the Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS) method.

Result: Experiments show that deactivating culture-sensitive neurons harms performance on culture-related questions disproportionately to others. CAS method identifies these neurons effectively.

Conclusion: Culture-sensitive neurons cluster in certain layers of vision-language models, indicating specific organizational structures for multimodal representations.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

*Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian,Zulfiya R. Gabidullina,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses optimizing computational resources for distributed machine learning by proposing a co-optimization algorithm that balances CPU resources and local ML training tasks, achieving improved convergence and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing demand for scalable, computationally efficient solutions in AI research, particularly in optimizing distributed computing resources for machine learning tasks.

Method: It formulates a co-optimization approach for data processing and CPU resource allocation. The method incorporates time-varying information-sharing networks, balanced weight consensus, and handles log-quantized data for efficient communication between nodes.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates over 50% improvement in cost optimality compared to existing CPU scheduling methods while ensuring convergence and stability verified through perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis.

Conclusion: The methodology successfully enhances computing resource optimization for distributed ML systems and establishes a more cost-effective solution than existing approaches, making it a promising tool in scalable AI research.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

*Noah Golowich,Allen Liu,Abhishek Shetty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and explores the low-dimensional structure in large language models using their logits, showcasing that they possess low approximate rank and leveraging this for novel generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and utilize large language models by exploring their inherent low-dimensional structures, using a model-agnostic approach.

Method: Empirical analysis to demonstrate low-rank structure in matrices from model logits followed by experiments leveraging this structure for response generation. On theory, an abstraction is developed and analyzed with provable learning guarantees.

Result: The study shows that large language models exhibit low-rank properties enabling response generation using linear combinations of unrelated prompts.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates how leveraging low-rank structures in language models gives insights into their behavior and opens up new avenues for response generation and theoretical representation analysis.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

*Mia Adler,Carrie Liang,Brian Peng,Oleg Presnyakov,Justin M. Baker,Jannelle Lauffer,Himani Sharma,Barry Merriman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rank-conditioned committee (RCC) framework for better separating uncertainties in antibody fitness landscapes and validates it with SARS-CoV-2 docking tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLDE pipelines struggle to handle conformational and epistemic uncertainties separately, which limits progress in antibody discovery.

Method: Develop a framework using ranked conformations to assign distinct deep neural network committees per rank to distinguish uncertainties.

Result: Experimental results on SARS-CoV-2 docking show noticeable improvements in accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The RCC framework is a promising scalable solution for therapeutic antibody discovery, especially in managing conformational uncertainties.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a game-theoretic feature selection framework to reduce computational costs in machine learning while maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the increasing computational costs in training machine learning models due to the presence of irrelevant features.

Method: The method models features as players in a cooperative game, evaluates their importance through interactions and contributions, and integrates sample selection, redundancy elimination, and optimized training.

Result: The proposed framework significantly reduces computation while retaining predictive accuracy, according to experimental results.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient way to address computational challenges in large-scale ML and is publicly available for use.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines distribution shifts during training and testing and finds that mismatched proportions can often improve test performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how mismatched training and test distributions can impact performance, particularly in ways that might be advantageous.

Method: The authors analyze training and testing on mixture distributions, investigating different proportions in theoretical scenarios.

Result: They demonstrate that distribution shift can be beneficial and identify optimal training proportions for improved performance under mismatched distributions.

Conclusion: Distribution shifts, even with unrelated components, can lead to improved test performance under specific circumstances.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

### [199] [LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983)
*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling method for offline reinforcement learning (RL), offering calibrated risk control during inference with improved performance on MuJoCo tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion policies for offline RL lack statistically valid risk control during sampling. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing an evidence-driven, calibrated risk-aware sampling mechanism.

Method: The method employs a sequential hypothesis test using log-likelihood ratios during denoising steps, combined with a logistic threshold controller calibrated to user-specified Type-I error levels. It integrates with existing Q-gradients and adheres to DDPM training structure while standardizing states and actions consistently.

Result: LRT-Diffusion demonstrated improved return and out-of-distribution (OOD) metrics compared to strong Q-guided baselines on D4RL MuJoCo tasks, while ensuring the desired Type-I error level alpha.

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion is a principled, inference-time modification that adds calibrated risk control to diffusion policies. It shows theoretical and practical improvements in managing risk and performance trade-offs for offline RL.

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

*Ria Jayanti,Tanish Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using machine learning for real-time seizure detection and prediction. It combines supervised learning for seizure detection with LSTM networks for prediction, evaluated on EEG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift epilepsy care from reactive seizure management to proactive treatment by predicting seizures before they occur.

Method: Supervised machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) for seizure detection, and LSTM deep learning for seizure prediction, using EEG data from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database.

Result: Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy and balanced recall (89.6%). LSTM models achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy. Random Forest and SVM showed high accuracy but failed on recall due to class imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of proactive seizure management, enabling patients to anticipate seizures and potentially reduce risks associated with unexpected attacks.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

### [201] [An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128)
*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using data augmentation (DA) beyond i.i.d. settings to improve causal inference, reducing confounding bias and enhancing predictive performance. It introduces IV-like regression to generalize across interventions and achieve better causal estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation (DA) is often employed for regularization in machine learning under i.i.d. conditions. However, in scenarios with hidden confounders, instrumental variables (IVs) for causal effect estimation may not always be available. The paper explores extending the utility of DA in situations lacking traditional IVs.

Method: The authors propose using DA as interventions on the treatment mechanism, introducing IV-like regression for situations with relaxed IV properties and parameterized DA in composition to test its effectiveness in worst-case scenarios. Methods are validated theoretically and with simulations and real-world data.

Result: Simulation experiments and theoretical demonstrations show that parameterized DA with relaxed IV properties aids in mitigating confounding biases and improves predictive and causal inference performance even in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Data augmentation can be used to replicate instrumental variable properties, reducing bias and improving generalization across interventions. The study emphasizes the potential of parameterized DA in broadening causal estimation strategies.

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

### [202] [Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24988)
*Hemanath Arumugam,Falong Fan,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new architecture combining a Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module with the Option-Critic framework to improve hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) by autonomously discovering meaningful subgoals and improving option termination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) faces challenges in autonomously identifying semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination criteria, which are critical for efficient decision-making in long-horizon tasks.

Method: This paper introduces a framework that integrates a Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module into the Option-Critic architecture. The CPD module is self-supervised, detects latent environmental changes, and employs auxiliary losses to optimize the model.

Result: Experiments show CPD-guided agents achieve faster convergence, increased cumulative rewards, and better option specialization in Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors through CPD segmentation enhances HRL, enabling more interpretable, efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

### [203] [What Really Matters in Matrix-Whitening Optimizers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25000)
*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates recent matrix-whitening optimizers, noting their superior performance over elementwise methods like Adam, and identifies variance adaptation as a key, overlooked factor driving these improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the key components and strategies in matrix-whitening optimizers that lead to notable performance improvements over traditional optimizers such as Adam.

Method: The paper systematically deconstructs matrix-whitening optimizers, compares their performance against other optimization methods, and conducts experiments to test the importance of spectral normalization and variance adaptation.

Result: Matrix-whitening optimizers outperformed elementwise ones, and the researchers highlighted the overlooked importance of variance adaptation in explaining performance gains. Adaptive versions of optimizers consistently showed superior results.

Conclusion: Variance adaptation is a critical feature enhancing the performance of matrix-whitening optimizers, with low-rank variance estimators being effective while minimizing memory costs.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

*Rahil Soroushmojdehi,Sina Javadzadeh,Mehrnaz Asadi,Terence D. Sanger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPIRE (Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder) is a deep model for disentangling shared and region-specific neural dynamics. It outperforms classical methods under nonlinear and temporal distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of separating shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity in multi-region neural data.

Method: The authors developed SPIRE, a multi-encoder autoencoder with alignment and disentanglement losses to factorize neural data into shared and private latent subspaces.

Result: SPIRE robustly recovers cross-regional neural structures and demonstrates effectiveness in synthetic benchmarks and DBS recordings, generalizing stimulation-specific dynamics across sites and frequencies.

Conclusion: SPIRE is established as a reliable and reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under external perturbations.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

*Sarmad Ahmad Khan,Simon Bernatz,Zahra Moslehi,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates how protocol and segmentation differences impact radiomics-based machine learning, showing protocol-invariant features improve robustness across MRI sequence shifts while dataset augmentation reduces errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of radiomics-based machine learning models to distribution shifts caused by imaging variations and improve their robustness and reliability in clinical settings.

Method: The study utilized a phantom of 16 fruits to assess the impact of distribution shifts caused by MRI protocol variations, segmentation approaches, and inter-observer variability. XGBoost classifiers were trained on robust and sequence-specific features, with performance measured on in-domain and out-of-domain conditions using metrics like F1-score and uncertainty calibration.

Result: Models trained on protocol-invariant features achieved F1-scores above 0.85 across distribution shifts, while general feature models showed 40% degradation under protocol variations. Data augmentation significantly improved uncertainty calibration by reducing ECE by 35%, and XGBoost demonstrated inherent reliability without significant calibration enhancements from temperature scaling.

Conclusion: Protocol-aware feature selection and structured phantom studies are effective approaches to designing robust radiomics models, ensuring resilience across real-world imaging protocol variations.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

### [206] [Graph Distance Based on Cause-Effect Estimands with Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25037)
*Zhufeng Li,Niki Kilbertus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph distance measure designed for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) with the aim of evaluating causal discovery methods effectively, particularly in the presence of latent confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery evaluations are challenging, particularly under latent confounding. There is a need for robust methods to measure progress in identifying causal relations.

Method: The authors propose a graph distance measure that quantifies differences in cause-effect estimands for treatment-outcome pairs using identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier.

Result: The proposed graph distance measure was analyzed under various graph perturbations and compared to existing metrics, demonstrating its potential effectiveness.

Conclusion: The suggested methodology provides a valuable tool for better evaluating causal graphs and understanding differences in causal estimations under latent confounding.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

*Mahmoud Hegazy,Michael I. Jordan,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable framework, 'utility calibration,' to measure multiclass classifier calibration errors based on user-specific utility functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the trustworthy evaluation of multiclass classifiers by addressing limitations in existing calibration metrics.

Method: The authors propose 'utility calibration,' a flexible framework that evaluates calibration error relative to user-defined utility functions.

Result: They illustrate that utility calibration unifies existing metrics, provides robust alternatives to current metrics, and extends calibration assessment beyond simplistic models.

Conclusion: Utility calibration establishes a comprehensive and scalable method for evaluating multiclass calibration, addressing the broader needs of end-user decision criteria.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempoPFN, a zero-shot time series forecasting model using linear RNNs trained on synthetic data, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in zero-shot time series forecasting, particularly long-horizon prediction inefficiencies and the lack of reproducibility among existing synthetic-only approaches.

Method: The authors develop the TempoPFN model with a GatedDeltaProduct architecture for efficient state-tracking and parallelizable training. They also create a diverse synthetic data pipeline as a training resource.

Result: TempoPFN achieves best-in-class performance on the Gift-Eval benchmark, surpassing models trained on real data and synthetic-only approaches. It is also more efficient due to its parallelizable architecture.

Conclusion: TempoPFN pushes the boundaries in zero-shot time series forecasting by combining an innovative model architecture with a robust synthetic training pipeline, and offers future opportunities for reproducibility with open-source contributions.

Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in
efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing
synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully
parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for
windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,
and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the
Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast
majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than
existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,

TL;DR: The paper proposes BOND, a method for estimating partial derivatives in network architectures using inaccessible computational graphs, improving performance without increasing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable estimation of partial derivatives in network structures with inaccessible computational graphs while improving accuracy and scalability.

Method: Developed BOND, a perturbative method that integrates black-box functions to estimate partial derivatives in models.

Result: BOND improves model performance by allowing fixed, non-trainable modules while keeping the number of trainable parameters constant.

Conclusion: Fixed, non-trainable modules backed by BOND have the potential to enhance model capacity and scalability, opening avenues for novel architecture explorations.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PESO, a LoRA-based continual learning method for recommendation tasks, designed to adapt to evolving user preferences while balancing preservation of past knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of large language models (LLMs) in continual learning in recommendation systems, particularly the need to adapt to evolving user preferences without being negatively impacted by outdated data.

Method: The proposed method, PESO, applies a proximal regularizer to LoRA, anchoring the current state to its most recent frozen version for flexible adaptation and preservation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates how the proximal design provides direction-focused guidance in the LoRA subspace.

Result: PESO significantly improves performance over existing LoRA-based continual learning methods in recommendation tasks, consistently outperforming them in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: PESO provides a balanced approach to continual learning in recommendation systems, enabling adaptability to current user interests while maintaining prior knowledge. This ensures better alignment with the dynamic nature of user preferences.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

*Chuxun Liu,Debo Cheng,Qingfeng Chen,Jiangzhang Gan,Jiuyong Li,Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairMIB, a framework for reducing biases in graph neural networks (GNNs) by decomposing graph data into multiple perspectives and employing advanced techniques like contrastive learning and information bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in GNNs can lead to discriminatory outcomes, and current methods fail to adequately address the complexity of biases from both node features and graph structure.

Method: FairMIB is a multi-view information bottleneck framework that uses techniques like contrastive learning, conditional information bottleneck objectives, and an adjacency correction mechanism to enhance fairness and maintain utility in GNNs.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance in balancing fairness and utility in GNNs.

Conclusion: FairMIB effectively mitigates biases in GNNs, improving fairness and utility by addressing distinct aspects of graph complexity and employing mutual information techniques.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the Sobolev IPM framework for graph metric spaces using Orlicz geometric structures, improving flexibility over $L^p$ norms and achieving computational efficiency with a novel regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of the existing Sobolev IPM method, which is constrained by $L^p$ geometric structures and unable to incorporate alternative structural priors.

Method: The study generalizes Sobolev IPM using Orlicz geometric structures and establishes a connection between Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm. The proposed GSI-M framework leverages this connection to reduce computation to a univariate optimization problem.

Result: The proposed GSI-M achieves significant computational efficiency, outpacing existing methods like Orlicz-Wasserstein. It also performs effectively in practical applications such as document classification and topological data analysis.

Conclusion: Generalized Sobolev IPM with Musielak regularization addresses the limitations of traditional $L^p$ structures, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and practical usability for problems defined on graph metrics.

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

*Naoki Kiyohara,Edward Johns,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) to model SDE transition laws using conditional normalizing flows, achieving faster and accurate sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the computational challenges and inefficiencies of traditional numerical solvers in sampling noisy and irregular time series modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

Method: The paper presents NSFs, a method that uses conditional normalizing flows with specific architectural constraints enabling direct learning of SDE transition laws and faster, one-shot sampling.

Result: NSFs demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude faster sampling while preserving distributional accuracy on both synthetic simulations and real-world tracking/video datasets.

Conclusion: NSFs provide a computationally efficient alternative for sampling SDEs, maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

### [214] [The Neural Differential Manifold: An Architecture with Explicit Geometric Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25113)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a geometry-informed neural network for enhanced generalization, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to create a neural network architecture that integrates geometric structure to improve optimization efficiency, generalization, robustness, and interpretability.

Method: The proposed NDM models neural networks as differentiable manifolds where layers act as coordinate charts. It uses three layers: Coordinate, Geometric, and Evolution Layers to parameterize geometry, regularize curvature, and use dual objectives for optimization.

Result: NDM aligns optimization with manifold geometry, enabling natural gradient descent and improved interpretability. It is theoretically advantageous for optimization, continual learning, and scientific applications.

Conclusion: NDM represents a shift in deep learning towards geometrically-structured, interpretable, and efficient models, though computational challenges remain.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear

including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual

modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

### [215] [A Unified Bilevel Model for Adversarial Learning and A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25121)
*Yutong Zheng,Qingna Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified bilevel model to better understand and measure the effect of adversarial attacks within clustering models, interpreting attacks as data perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks in machine learning lack clear interpretation and effective measures, especially for clustering models where the impact of data perturbation remains unclear.

Method: The authors develop a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and analyze adversarial attacks by examining the perturbation effects on data in clustering models.

Result: Findings reveal that small data perturbations keep clustering models robust, but larger perturbations lead to attacks, altering the clustering results. They also explore the $$-measure’s validity as a tool for assessing adversarial effects.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel model and $$-measure provide new insights into adversarial learning in clustering models, offering a framework for understanding and measuring attack impacts effectively.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

*Woojin Cho,Kookjin Lee,Noseong Park,Donsub Rim,Gerrit Welper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a data-driven method using neural networks for dimensionality reduction in hyperbolic wave propagation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient representation of hyperbolic wave propagation data for physics-based applications is challenging. This paper aims to provide a solution using advanced neural architectures.

Method: The authors design a specialized low rank neural representation (LRNR) within a hypernetwork framework, motivated by theoretical proofs supporting low-dimensional representation.

Result: The trained LRNRs naturally produce low rank tensor representations, enabling efficient decomposition of wave propagation into interpretable physical modes.

Conclusion: The LRNR architecture is effective for dimensionality reduction and supports efficient inference, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

*Yuen Chen,Yulun Wu,Samuel Sharpe,Igor Melnyk,Nam H. Nguyen,Furong Huang,C. Bayan Bruss,Rizal Fathony*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIDGE, a novel architecture combining sequence encoding and graph neural networks for joint learning. It outperforms existing approaches in friendship prediction and fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often have both sequence and relational aspects, which existing models tend to treat separately. The aim is to resolve this disconnect by integrating these modalities for better performance.

Method: BRIDGE combines a sequence encoder with a Graph Neural Network (GNN). It uses TOKENXATTN, a token-level cross-attention layer, for fine-grained message passing between neighboring sequences.

Result: BRIDGE surpasses GNNs, temporal graph models, and sequence-based architectures in ranking and classification metrics in friendship prediction and fraud detection tasks.

Conclusion: Joint learning of sequential and relational data significantly enhances prediction and classification tasks, and BRIDGE successfully achieves this with its unified architecture.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

### [218] [Lipschitz-aware Linearity Grafting for Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25130)
*Yongjin Han,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving a neural network's certified robustness by reducing approximation errors in calculating Lipschitz constants, introducing linearity grafting as an effective method to achieve tighter Lipschitz constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to certified robustness for neural networks face challenges due to approximation errors in calculating Lipschitz constants, limiting scalability and precision.

Method: The authors propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method to eliminate dominant approximation errors by grafting linear functions into non-linear activations.

Result: The method significantly tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Linearity grafting serves as an effective approach to overcoming approximation obstacles and improving certified robustness, even without certified training.

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

*Weimin Huang,Ryan Piansky,Bistra Dilkina,Daniel K. Molzahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an ML-guided framework to solve the computationally challenging Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem in wildfire risk management efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of managing wildfire risks caused by power lines while reducing load shedding. Traditional optimization methods for OPS are computationally demanding and require frequent, rapid resolution in operational situations.

Method: The authors develop and enhance ML-guided frameworks specifically for OPS, integrating domain knowledge about the number of energized and de-energized lines. This approach leverages shared structural patterns in instances of the OPS problem to improve solution efficiency.

Result: The proposed ML-guided method demonstrates faster and high-quality de-energization solutions compared to traditional optimization techniques when tested on a large-scale Californian synthetic power system.

Conclusion: ML-driven frameworks tailored for OPS problems can provide practical, rapid, and effective solutions, showcasing their potential utility in operational settings to mitigate wildfire risks more efficiently.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

### [220] [Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207)
*Yisong Fu,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Yujie Li,Zhulin An,Qi Wang,Yongjun Xu,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a selective learning strategy to improve deep learning models for time series forecasting by effectively handling overfitting caused by noise and anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting often face severe overfitting due to the influence of noise and anomalies in the data. Current methods treating all timesteps equally exacerbate this problem.

Method: The authors propose a selective learning strategy that uses a dual-mask mechanism to filter non-generalizable timesteps. The two masks are: (1) an uncertainty mask that leverages residual entropy to remove uncertain timesteps, and (2) an anomaly mask that employs residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps.

Result: Testing the method on eight real-world datasets showed significant improvements in predictive performance for state-of-the-art deep models, such as 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Conclusion: The proposed selective learning strategy effectively enhances the generalization performance of deep learning models in time series forecasting by focusing on reliable timesteps and mitigating overfitting.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

*Nikita Kachaev,Mikhail Kolosov,Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how action fine-tuning impacts Vision-Language Models (VLMs) used in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, revealing degradation in visual representations and proposing strategies to mitigate it for better OOD generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to investigate whether Vision-Language Models can retain their original vision-language capabilities after being adapted for action-based tasks in Vision-Language-Action systems.

Method: The authors analyze VLA representations using probing techniques, attention map analysis, targeted tasks, and compare VLA models with their base VLMs. They also propose strategies for aligning visual representations to mitigate degradation issues during adaptation.

Result: Naive action fine-tuning causes degradation in visual representations of VLA models. However, a proposed alignment method effectively mitigates this degradation and improves model generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper clarifies the trade-off between fine-tuning for action and preserving inherited Vision-Language Model capabilities, offering practical solutions to recover and enhance these capabilities with improved generalization.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning, introducing a method for handling multi-class scenarios (MPU) using adaptive loss weighting, ensuring unbiased risk estimation and enhancing stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotating reliable negative data is expensive or challenging in real-world applications, creating a need for methods to handle Positive-Unlabeled learning that ensure accuracy and stability, especially in multi-class settings.

Method: The authors propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU learning method based on adaptive loss weighting within the empirical risk minimization framework. Distinct, data-dependent weights are assigned to loss components to ensure unbiased risk estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight datasets with varying class priors and numbers of classes demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and stability compared to strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive loss weighting approach effectively handles multi-class PU learning and achieves unbiased risk estimation, offering an accurate and stable solution to missing negative labels in various applications.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

*Wenjie Zhou,Bohan Wang,Wei Chen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BSFA, a deep learning optimization framework enhancing stability and speeding up convergence by scaling updates differently in Dom-space and Bulk-space, achieving impressive speedup results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dichotomy in deep learning optimization where updates in dominant loss-space directions (Dom-space) are large but minimally effective, and updates in Bulk-space are smaller but drive learning.

Method: BSFA framework scales updates differently across Dom-space and Bulk-space using PCA-based estimations and block-wise strategies for efficient subspace estimation.

Result: BSFA achieves approximately twice the speedup in pre-training LLaMA on various datasets compared to the standard optimizer AdamW.

Conclusion: BSFA effectively accelerates training while enhancing stability, making it practical and scalable for large model training.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

TL;DR: The paper presents two techniques to enhance Bayesian network structure sampling efficiency, offering significant improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency of sampling Bayesian network structures, which is computationally expensive, especially while summing over parent sets.

Method: The authors propose two techniques: efficient implementation of arc modifications and preprocessing methods to prune parent sets for improved computational performance.

Result: The empirical study demonstrates substantial efficiency gains in sampling compared to previous methodologies.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques improve the efficiency of Bayesian network structure inference, making it more computationally viable for complex datasets.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBNorm, an Information Bottleneck-inspired normalization method for deep learning. It achieves better representation by balancing predictive information preservation and nuisance suppression compared to existing variance-centric normalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization techniques focus on stabilizing training by enforcing variance-centric properties but do not optimize how representations capture relevant task information. This paper aims to address that limitation.

Method: The proposed method, IBNorm, incorporates bounded compression operations inspired by the Information Bottleneck principle to improve the quality of embeddings while maintaining standard normalization stability.

Result: IBNorm achieves consistently higher performance than BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across diverse large-scale language (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision (ResNet, ViT) models. It also displays superior Information Bottleneck behavior according to mutual information analysis.

Conclusion: IBNorm provides more informative representations than variance-centric normalization methods while maintaining stability and compatibility. The theoretical and empirical findings demonstrate its advantages and promise widespread applicability in deep learning.

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models face instability and vulnerability issues like sensitivity to input changes and sharp optimization loss landscapes.

Method: The study leverages Lipschitz continuous networks, curvature regularization, and randomized smoothing to improve stability, generalization, and robustness.

Result: Developed efficient spectral norm computation, Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved certification methods, along with theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: A unified approach combining various methods enhances neural network stability and robustness, addressing key challenges in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

*Xizhe Wang,Xiaobin Song,Qingshan Jia,Hongbo Zhao,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics by hierarchically learning PDE components and their combinations, ensuring physical consistency and data efficiency while enabling interpretable discovery of unknown physical laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of deriving governing PDEs for complex spatiotemporal systems due to nonlinearity, high-order derivatives, and incomplete knowledge has motivated the development of more advanced physics-embedded data-driven methods.

Method: The paper presents a hierarchical physics-embedded framework with two levels: one for learning symbolic components of PDEs and another for combining them. It uses adaptive Fourier Neural Operators to handle non-local dependencies and high-order operators, integrating physical consistency.

Result: The proposed framework improves both prediction and discovery of physical laws from sparse, noisy data, while utilizing structural decomposition for interpretability and systematically embedding prior physical knowledge.

Conclusion: This work advances data-driven approaches by structurally embedding physical laws, enhancing efficiency, ensuring physical consistency, and enabling interpretable symbolic regression for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi Goal RL framework to learn a policy mixture that maximizes expected return while dispersing state distribution across rewarding states, addressing the gap in existing RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL algorithms may focus too narrowly on maximizing expected return for few reward sources, lacking mechanisms to ensure uniformly dispersed state distributions across goal states—a desired property in natural situations.

Method: The proposed algorithm optimizes a customized RL reward calculated at each iteration using sampled trajectories and offline RL techniques, enabling learning of a policy mixture with dispersed state distributions across goal states.

Result: The paper provides convergence guarantees for its algorithm, demonstrating efficient optimization for balancing expected return and dispersion, supported by experiments on synthetic MDPs and RL environments.

Conclusion: The developed algorithm successfully expands on existing RL methods by addressing the trade-off between maximizing return and dispersing state distributions over goal states, showing theoretical and experimental efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of designing expressive and computationally efficient linear layers for normalizing flows, which require fast computation of matrix inverses and Jacobian determinants.

Method: A novel invertible linear layer is proposed, which decomposes transformations into a product of circulant and diagonal matrices, reducing parameter complexity and leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform to optimize time complexity.

Result: The proposed method, termed Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), achieves competitive density estimation on natural image datasets, effectively models periodic data, and significantly reduces computation time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CDFlow serves as an efficient and scalable approach for generative modeling by maintaining expressive capabilities while significantly accelerating computational tasks.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in predicting information cascade popularity in social networks by proposing a time-ordered evaluation method, creating a rich dataset called Taoke, and introducing an efficient model CasTemp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for information cascade prediction suffer from temporal leakage, lack of practical datasets, and computational inefficiencies. This paper aims to provide a realistic evaluation setup, richer datasets, and an efficient modeling solution.

Method: The authors propose (1) a time-ordered data splitting strategy to prevent temporal leakage, (2) a new dataset (Taoke) with detailed promoter/product information and purchase conversions, and (3) a model (CasTemp) utilizing temporal walks, Jaccard-based neighbor selection, and GRU-based encoding with time-aware attention.

Result: CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets while being computationally efficient, and demonstrates effectiveness in predicting second-stage popularity conversions.

Conclusion: The study systematically addresses key limitations in information cascade prediction methods and offers effective solutions, providing a practical framework for real-world applications.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

*Adrien Weihs,Andrea Bertozzi,Matthew Thorpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes variational learning on random geometric hypergraphs, proposes a novel Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) method, and demonstrates its empirical effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited theoretical understanding of hypergraphs in semi-supervised learning and provide robust frameworks for modeling higher-order interactions.

Method: The authors performed an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational learning on random geometric hypergraphs and proposed HOHL, which uses powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness regularization.

Result: The analysis ensures conditions for hypergraph learning's well-posedness and shows convergence to a weighted p-Laplacian equation. HOHL converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm and demonstrates strong empirical performance on standard datasets.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of hypergraph learning's theoretical foundations and introduces an effective framework (HOHL) for practical learning tasks.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

### [232] [Parameter Averaging in Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25361)
*Rupesh Sapkota,Caglar Demir,Arnab Sharma,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes weighted averaging as a model merging technique in knowledge graph embedding models for link prediction and other tasks, eliminating the need for training multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and computational challenges in using ensemble learning for knowledge graph embedding models, particularly the high resource demands of training multiple models.

Method: The researchers introduced a weighted averaging model merging technique, maintaining a running average of model parameters during training and incorporating a mechanism to update parameters only when validation performance improves.

Result: The weighted averaging method demonstrated consistent performance improvements across link prediction tasks, literal-augmented models, and multi-hop query answering tasks in comparison to traditional benchmark ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: Weighted averaging in model merging offers a more computationally efficient and effective alternative to traditional ensemble learning for various knowledge graph embedding tasks, reducing overhead while boosting performance.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

### [233] [A Convexity-dependent Two-Phase Training Algorithm for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25366)
*Tomas Hrycej,Bernhard Bermeitinger,Massimo Pavone,Götz-Henrik Wiegand,Siegfried Handschuh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-phase optimization algorithm that alternates between Adam and Conjugate Gradient methods based on the convexity of the loss function to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the inefficiencies in handling loss functions that transition from non-convex to convex regions during optimization in machine learning tasks.

Method: A two-phase optimization framework is developed, which identifies the transition point from non-convexity to convexity by monitoring the gradient norm dependence on the loss function. Adam is applied for non-convex regions, and Conjugate Gradient is used for convex regions.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates that this convexity structure is common in real-world tasks, leading to improved convergence rates and better model accuracy in computational experiments.

Conclusion: The study successfully exploits the transition from non-convex to convex regions in loss functions through a two-phase algorithm, showing practical benefits in machine learning optimization.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

*Adrien Weihs,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces scalable architectures for learning both individual and collections of operators, achieving strong theoretical and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in approximating mappings between function spaces, which are crucial for scientific applications, but less explored than finite-dimensional mappings.

Method: The paper develops two architectures, MNO and MONet, for multiple operator representation, along with a balanced framework for learning independent operators. Universal approximation results and scaling laws for network size are derived.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate strong expressive power and efficiency on parametric PDE benchmarks, establishing theoretical scalability and practical utility for neural operator learning.

Conclusion: The study provides a solid foundation for neural operator learning, unifying theoretical and practical insights for representing operators efficiently across multiple problems.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPTOpt, a method utilizing fine-tuned LLMs for solving continuous, expensive black-box optimization tasks, achieving better performance than traditional optimizers without parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve sample efficiency in global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions by overcoming the limitations of classical methods like Bayesian Optimization and enhancing the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The authors fine-tuned large language models on synthetic datasets generated from diverse Bayesian Optimization parameterizations, enabling the LLM to generalize across various black-box optimization tasks.

Result: GPTOpt outperformed traditional optimization methods on a range of black-box optimization benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to handle these tasks effectively.

Conclusion: GPTOpt showcases the potential of LLMs to achieve advanced numerical reasoning and offers a tunable-free framework for global black-box optimization.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

*Florian A. Hölzl,Daniel Rueckert,Georgios Kaissis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA), a metric to track generalization and attribute performance to training samples, improving model analysis without a validation set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a validation metric that efficiently tracks generalization during training, identifies influential training samples, and works without reliance on a validation set.

Method: Proposes the Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA) metric, which measures alignment between per-sample gradients and model weights to monitor training dynamics and generalization.

Result: GWA is shown to predict optimal early stopping, facilitate model comparisons, and identify influential training samples. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness during training.

Conclusion: The GWA metric provides a validation set-independent approach for analyzing training dynamics and generalization, paving the way for enhanced model analysis and monitoring.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

*Luca Andolfi,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces prototypical neurosymbolic architectures to tackle reasoning shortcuts by combining prototypical learning and symbolic constraints, with demonstrated improvements in both synthetic and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neurosymbolic AI systems are prone to reasoning shortcuts, where spurious correlations lead to incorrect predictions. There was a need for a framework ensuring models learn accurate concepts for reliable reasoning, especially in low-data scenarios.

Method: The authors proposed prototypical neurosymbolic architectures that utilize prototypical learning theory. The model considers input similarity to a few labeled data points while enforcing symbolic constraints.

Result: Significant improvements were reported across synthetic and real-world tasks in low-supervision settings, validated through the rsbench benchmark suite.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates promise in addressing reasoning shortcuts and presents prototype grounding as a safer, more annotation-efficient neurosymbolic learning strategy.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

TL;DR: This paper applies machine learning to predict employee burnout risk, with SVM showing the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the impact of burnout on individual well-being and organizational performance by enabling early detection using computational methods.

Method: Three algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) were tested for burnout prediction using 30-fold cross-validation, and an interactive interface was built via Streamlit.

Result: Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and outperformed other models statistically.

Conclusion: Machine learning, particularly SVM, shows promise in predicting burnout risk, and the interactive interface supports practical, non-technical usability for organizations.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

*Amin Parchami-Araghi,Sukrut Rao,Jonas Fischer,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to concept-based explanations in deep networks, ensuring faithfulness to the model and quantitative consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A need for faithful and interpretable concept-based explanations of deep networks' functioning beyond existing post-hoc approaches, which often lack fidelity and make restrictive assumptions.

Method: Proposed a model with inherent mechanistic concept-explanations, enabling traceability of concepts across layers and their contributions to logits. Introduced a Concept-Consistency (C$^2$-Score) metric using foundation models.

Result: Demonstrated that the proposed concepts are quantitatively more consistent and user-interpretable while maintaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: The approach improves faithfulness, interpretability, and consistency of concept-based explanations, surpassing prior methods without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

*Yuan Cheng,Yu Huang,Zhe Xiong,Yingbin Liang,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel metric and framework to improve transformer-based models in uncovering graph structures in data, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding graph structures in real-world data is critical for applications across various scientific fields. While transformers have shown success in capturing graph dependencies, developing theoretical guarantees for complex graphs like DAGs remains a challenge.

Method: A kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI) metric based on $f$-divergence is introduced. This is combined with multi-head attention in transformers, allowing individual attention heads to focus on different parent-child relationships using distinct marginal transition kernels.

Result: The authors prove that training single-layer, multi-head transformers on $K$-parent DAGs converges to the global optimum in polynomial time. At convergence, the attention scores accurately reflect the ground truth adjacency matrix when using KL divergence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models complex DAGs, recovers graph structures, and achieves theoretical guarantees, with experimental validation supporting the approach.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) using a quantum circuit as the hidden state, offering competitive performance in sequence-learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the exponential memory capacity of quantum circuits for sequence-learning tasks while integrating classical control and maintaining physical consistency.

Method: A hybrid quantum-classical QRNN where a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as the hidden state, with classical feedforward control added for nonlinearity and mid-circuit readouts for partial observations.

Result: Evaluation demonstrated competitive performance against classical baselines on tasks like sentiment analysis, MNIST variants, memory tasks, language modeling, and machine translation.

Conclusion: The QRNN provides an innovative and effective integration of quantum operations for sequence-learning, showcasing scalability and high-capacity quantum memory with practical applications.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of oceanographic variables helps in climate change understanding, maritime optimization, and marine resource management. Traditional methods like numerical models have limitations in scalability and computational efficiency.

Method: Aurora, a deep learning atmospheric model, is fine-tuned for SST prediction using high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data. The authors utilize latitude-weighted error metrics, staged fine-tuning processes, and hyperparameter optimization.

Result: The model achieves a low RMSE of 0.119K and maintains a high anomaly correlation coefficient (~0.997). It captures large-scale SST structures but struggles with fine coastal detail.

Conclusion: Deep learning models pre-trained in other domains can be adapted for ocean forecasting. Enhancements include integrating more variables, improving spatial resolution, and using physics-informed neural networks to improve understanding and accuracy.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances classical PAC-Bayes to provide generalization guarantees for deterministic classifiers instead of stochastic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of classical PAC-Bayes, which only provides guarantees on expected risk for stochastic predictions, making it impractical for deterministic hypotheses in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework to derive guarantees for deterministic hypotheses from stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. They introduce a general oracle bound, numerical bound, and a specific application for majority voting.

Result: Their proposed approach demonstrates up to twice better generalization bounds for deterministic classifiers when compared to popular baselines.

Conclusion: This work extends PAC-Bayes to effectively handle deterministic classifiers, making it more applicable for practical deployment situations requiring single deterministic models.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes spectral-norm errors for low-rank pseudoinverses of noisy matrices and provides sharper perturbation bounds that track errors under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how noise affects low-rank pseudoinverse approximations, which are essential in scalable machine learning and scientific computing.

Method: The paper uses contour integral techniques on the non-entire function f(z) = 1/z to derive sharper non-asymptotic perturbation bounds under mild noise assumptions.

Result: The new bounds reduce prediction error by up to a factor of √n compared to classical bounds and closely match observed perturbation errors in experiments.

Conclusion: These results provide spectrum-aware guarantees for robust low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computational scenarios, improving classical bounds significantly.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) such as unstructured feedback and poor scalability, and reduces memory/computation overhead in training deep neural networks.

Method: Introduce a structured local learning framework using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), composite loss functions, and feedback matrix alignment to train neural network layers efficiently.

Result: Demonstrates comparable accuracy to backpropagation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, with reduced parameter overhead and effective low-rank learning.

Conclusion: The proposed low-rank learning approach is a scalable and effective alternative to traditional gradient-based training methods, addressing both memory and computational concerns.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

*Christopher Bülte,Yusuf Sale,Gitta Kutyniok,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a family of uncertainty quantification measures for regression tasks based on kernel scores, emphasizing their practical design and task-specific utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression tasks, especially in safety-critical areas, lack proper uncertainty quantification despite its importance; current research mostly focuses on classification.

Method: The paper introduces a framework built on proper scoring rules, specifically kernel scores, to measure total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainties. It provides design guidelines and links kernel characteristics to performance.

Result: Experiments validate the proposed measures, showing their effectiveness in tasks such as robustness and out-of-distribution detection, while highlighting trade-offs among different measures.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled approach for uncertainty quantification in regression tasks, with a focus on providing flexibility and tailored measures for specific applications.

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

*Mengzhao Chen,Meng Wu,Hui Jin,Zhihang Yuan,Jing Liu,Chaoyi Zhang,Yunshui Li,Jie Huang,Jin Ma,Zeyue Xue,Zhiheng Liu,Xingyan Bin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes floating-point (FP) and integer (INT) quantization formats, highlighting trade-offs and performance differences, suggesting INT formats like MXINT8 as efficient for AI accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified comparison between FP and INT quantization formats for guiding algorithm and hardware co-design in modern AI environments.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates FP and INT formats across varying granularities, leveraging fine-grained block-wise comparisons and introducing a symmetric clipping technique.

Result: Key findings show that FP excels at coarse quantization but INT outperforms FP in fine-grained formats like MXINT8. Techniques like Hadamard rotation improve INT formats further.

Conclusion: Fine-grained INT formats, especially MXINT8, provide better accuracy, power, and efficiency compared to FP formats, challenging current hardware design trends favoring FP.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the training stability and performance of GANs by introducing a BOLT-inspired modification to the WGAN framework.

Method: Introduced BOLT-GAN which uses a Lipschitz continuous discriminator to minimize a metric distance different from the Earth Mover distance.

Result: Outperforms WGAN on benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, LSUN Church-64) with 10-60% lower Frechet Inception Distance.

Conclusion: BOLT-GAN demonstrates improved training and stability in GANs, suggesting BOLT is a valuable principle for enhancing GAN models.

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedLap, a framework addressing federated learning with graph-structured data, focusing on privacy and scalability by using Laplacian smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for federated learning with graph-structured data face privacy risks or scalability issues due to sensitive data sharing or computational burdens.

Method: FedLap leverages Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and scalability.

Result: FedLap demonstrates competitive or superior performance on benchmark datasets compared to existing techniques. Privacy analysis confirms strong guarantees.

Conclusion: FedLap is the first federated learning scheme for interconnected subgraphs that balances privacy, scalability, and effective learning, proving its utility across experiments.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

### [250] [Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of noise and measurement errors on low-rank approximations in the spectral norm and delivers improved guarantees for differentially private PCA using a novel contour bootstrapping method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accurate utility guarantees in spectral norm analysis for low-rank matrix approximations, which are critical in settings like differentially private PCA.

Method: The paper derives new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices and applies a contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis to refine utility guarantees.

Result: Proposed bounds are sharp, showing improvement in estimating the spectral error (up to a factor of √n) and improving utility guarantees for differentially private PCA.

Conclusion: These contributions enhance the understanding of spectral norm perturbation and deliver practical utility improvements for privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

*Elia Torre,Michele Viscione,Lucas Pompe,Benjamin F Grewe,Valerio Mante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RNNs are used to emulate discrete latent dynamics found in natural behaviors, replicating HMM dynamics and revealing mechanisms for stochastic and spontaneous outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of previous RNN models in generating natural, stochastic, spontaneous behaviors and understanding how RNNs can model discrete latent states seen in HMMs.

Method: Training RNNs to replicate HMM emission statistics and analyzing their mechanisms, focusing on dynamics, connectivity, and neuronal motifs for probabilistic computation.

Result: Trained RNNs emulate HMM dynamics via structured connectivity and rotations in noise-driven orbits, utilizing deterministic transitions triggered by specialized 'kick neurons'.

Conclusion: RNNs can generalize and emulate discrete latent dynamics, suggesting compositional principles that make them capable of modeling natural stochastic behaviors.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

*Alessandro Lucchetti,Francesco Cadini,Marco Giglio,Luca Lomazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GNSS, a GNN framework optimized for dynamic structural simulations with improved accuracy and speed compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of focus on dynamic structural problems in GNN surrogate modeling while offering a competitive alternative to traditional finite element simulations.

Method: Developed the GNSS framework with three features: node kinematics in local frames, sign-aware regression loss, and wavelength-informed graph connectivity.

Result: GNSS outperformed existing GNNs and explicit finite element methods by accurately modeling a dynamic beam's behavior and generalizing to new conditions.

Conclusion: GNSS proves to be a high-speed and accurate tool for dynamic structural simulations, outperforming traditional methods and existing GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, combining convolutional operations with spiking neurons and GRU mechanisms for high-performance sequential processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in capturing fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data using previous spiking and GRU-based methods.

Method: The proposed architecture integrates convolutional operations to preserve local structure while leveraging spiking neurons and GRU gating mechanisms for robust sequential data processing.

Result: CS-GRU achieves around 4.35% improvement over state-of-the-art GRU variants, with over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% accuracy on MNIST, while being 69% more efficient compared to SpikGRU.

Conclusion: CS-GRU demonstrates superior performance and efficiency on temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, providing a promising solution for complex sequential data processing.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method (LieSolver) for solving PDEs using Lie symmetries to enforce exact solutions within the model, improving accuracy, computational efficiency, and error estimation compared to PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in solving initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs), such as computational inefficiency and lack of accuracy in traditional neural network-based methods.

Method: The method incorporates Lie symmetries to enforce the PDE by construction, integrates physical laws into the model via symmetry transformations, and uses initial/boundary data for learning solutions effectively.

Result: LieSolver is implemented for linear homogeneous PDEs, achieving faster and more accurate solutions than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), along with improved convergence and rigorous error estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances computational efficiency and predictive reliability for PDE-constrained problems, offering a robust approach to solving IBVPs.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLPrE, a scalable preprocessing and exploratory data analysis tool designed to handle diverse datasets for machine learning workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations in scalability and robustness of current tools for preprocessing and evaluating diverse data sources, critical for modern machine learning demands.

Method: The MLPrE tool uses SparkDataFrames for scalable data handling and a JSON format for describing data alteration steps, implementing 69 stages of processing and exploration.

Result: MLPrE effectively preprocesses and analyzes datasets, handling various fields independently, and demonstrates its capabilities with diverse datasets including UniProt dataset and wine quality data.

Conclusion: MLPrE is a generalizable and scalable tool filling a gap in preprocessing and data analysis for machine learning, enabling more efficient and simplified workflows.

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

TL;DR: The paper critiques conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches for medical imaging, highlighting their inability to handle contextual relationships, and showcases limitations via a synthetic classification task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of traditional MIL methods in medical imaging, which fail to account for contextual relationships, especially relevant in adjacent patches or slices.

Method: The paper designs a synthetic classification task and quantitatively evaluates traditional and newer correlated MIL methods against the optimal Bayes estimator for their ability to account for contextual relationships.

Result: Traditional off-the-shelf MIL approaches and newer methods are shown to struggle with generalization and fail to perform optimally in scenarios requiring contextual instance consideration.

Conclusion: Conventional MIL approaches and newer methods exhibit limitations in generalizing effectively for high-resolution medical imaging tasks where adjacent contextual features are critical.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDEN, a novel architecture extending the energy paradigm to model sequential memory effectively, offering exponential sequence memory capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static energy-based models like Hopfield networks in modeling sequential memory essential for transitions between memories.

Method: EDEN combines a static energy network with a modulatory population that evolves dynamics over multiple timescales, enabling precise memory transitions and high capacity.

Result: EDEN achieves exponential sequence memory capacity and exhibits dynamics resembling human brain activity during episodic memory tasks.

Conclusion: EDEN provides a unified framework for both static and sequential memory, offering scalable and interpretable solutions for temporal memory modeling in artificial and biological contexts.

Abstract: The energy paradigm, exemplified by Hopfield networks, offers a principled
framework for memory in neural systems by interpreting dynamics as descent on
an energy surface. While powerful for static associative memories, it falls
short in modeling sequential memory, where transitions between memories are
essential. We introduce the Exponential Dynamic Energy Network (EDEN), a novel
architecture that extends the energy paradigm to temporal domains by evolving
the energy function over multiple timescales. EDEN combines a static
high-capacity energy network with a slow, asymmetrically interacting modulatory
population, enabling robust and controlled memory transitions. We formally
derive short-timescale energy functions that govern local dynamics and use them
to analytically compute memory escape times, revealing a phase transition
between static and dynamic regimes. The analysis of capacity, defined as the
number of memories that can be stored with minimal error rate as a function of
the dimensions of the state space (number of feature neurons), for EDEN shows
that it achieves exponential sequence memory capacity $O(\gamma^N)$,
outperforming the linear capacity $O(N)$ of conventional models. Furthermore,
EDEN's dynamics resemble the activity of time and ramping cells observed in the
human brain during episodic memory tasks, grounding its biological relevance.
By unifying static and sequential memory within a dynamic energy framework,
EDEN offers a scalable and interpretable model for high-capacity temporal
memory in both artificial and biological systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage entropy production principles and symmetry constraints for creating high-performance, energy-efficient analog computing systems that can be realized through standard integrated circuit technology.

Method: The framework relies on a generalized maximum-entropy principle to model mesoscopic systems of interconnected analog elements, extended to non-equilibrium conditions. A fabricated proof-of-concept RF correlator using 22 nm SOI CMOS proved the approach.

Result: The fabricated RF correlator demonstrated compute efficiency exceeding 2 PetaOPS/W at 8-bit precision and 0.8 ExaOPS/W at 3-bit precision while operating at high data rates. The prototypes showcased applications like spectrum sensing and code-domain communications.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of entropy-based analog computing for achieving unprecedented energy efficiency and high-performance in edge applications via integrated circuit technology.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how the physics of entropy production, when
combined with symmetry constraints, can be used for implementing
high-performance and energy-efficient analog computing systems. At the core of
the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can
describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an
interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be
readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the
maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP)
distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as
the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational
throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to
non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a
proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated
in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency
greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W)
at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per
second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates
greater than 4 GS/s. Using the fabricated prototypes, we also showcase several
real-world RF applications at the edge, including spectrum sensing, and
code-domain communications.

mechanisms provide a flexible and adaptive approach to evolutionary
optimization, improving solution quality in many cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark suite for evaluating multi-objective optimization algorithms in Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) design, addressing a gap in real-world constrained problems for Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Synthetic Benchmark Problems (SBPs) for evaluating metaheuristic algorithms lack realism, especially for Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) linked to engineering applications such as BTMS design.

Method: A benchmark suite comprising real-world constrained problems for BTMS is developed using surrogate models based on thermal-fluid interactions from recent research.

Result: The benchmark suite effectively serves as a practical tool for testing optimization algorithms specifically tailored for energy storage thermal management.

Conclusion: The study creates a specialized benchmark suite to bridge the gap in evaluating constrained multi-objective optimization techniques for real-world engineering problems, with a focus on BTMS.

Abstract: Synthetic Benchmark Problems (SBPs) are commonly used to evaluate the
performance of metaheuristic algorithms. However, these SBPs often contain
various unrealistic properties, potentially leading to underestimation or
overestimation of algorithmic performance. While several benchmark suites
comprising real-world problems have been proposed for various types of
metaheuristics, a notable gap exists for Constrained Multi-objective
Optimization Problems (CMOPs) derived from practical engineering applications,
particularly in the domain of Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) design.
To address this gap, this study develops and presents a specialized benchmark
suite for multi-objective optimization in BTMS. This suite comprises a diverse
collection of real-world constrained problems, each defined via accurate
surrogate models based on recent research to efficiently represent complex
thermal-fluid interactions. The primary goal of this benchmark suite is to
provide a practical and relevant testing ground for evolutionary algorithms and
optimization methods focused on energy storage thermal management. Future work
will involve establishing comprehensive baseline results using state-of-the-art
algorithms, conducting comparative analyses, and developing a standardized
ranking scheme to facilitate robust performance assessment.

### [261] [The influence of the random numbers quality on the results in stochastic simulations and machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25269)
*Benjamin A. Antunes*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The study evaluates how the statistical quality of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) impacts performance in stochastic applications. Low-quality generators significantly degrade results, while mid-to-high-quality generators generally perform similarly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of pseudorandom number generator quality on the outcomes of stochastic computations in simulations and machine learning.

Method: The study tested seven PRNGs on four tasks: an epidemiological agent-based model, MNIST classification using Python/NumPy and C++, and reinforcement learning in CartPole. Each setup was repeated 30 times per generator, using fixed seeds.

Result: Low-quality PRNGs led to deviations in simulation dynamics, lower ML accuracy, and degraded reinforcement learning performance. Higher-quality PRNGs performed comparably across most tasks except RL, where the highest quality enhanced results.

Conclusion: Choosing PRNGs with sufficient statistical robustness mitigates sensitivity to PRNG family/design for most tasks. However, low-quality PRNGs introduce significant errors in stochastic computations.

Abstract: Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are ubiquitous in stochastic
simulations and machine learning (ML), where they drive sampling, parameter
initialization, regularization, and data shuffling. While widely used, the
potential impact of PRNG statistical quality on computational results remains
underexplored. In this study, we investigate whether differences in PRNG
quality, as measured by standard statistical test suites, can influence
outcomes in representative stochastic applications. Seven PRNGs were evaluated,
ranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known
statistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister,
PCG, and Philox. We applied these PRNGs to four distinct tasks: an
epidemiological agent-based model (ABM), two independent from-scratch MNIST
classification implementations (Python/NumPy and C++), and a reinforcement
learning (RL) CartPole environment. Each experiment was repeated 30 times per
generator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were
compared using appropriate statistical analyses. Results show that very poor
statistical quality, as in the ''bad'' LCG failing 125 TestU01 Crush tests,
produces significant deviations in ABM epidemic dynamics, reduces MNIST
classification accuracy, and severely degrades RL performance. In contrast,
mid-and good-quality LCGs-despite failing a limited number of Crush or BigCrush
tests-performed comparably to top-tier PRNGs in most tasks, with the RL
experiment being the primary exception where performance scaled with
statistical quality. Our findings indicate that, once a generator meets a
sufficient statistical robustness threshold, its family or design has
negligible impact on outcomes for most workloads, allowing selection to be
guided by performance and implementation considerations. However, the use of
low-quality PRNGs in sensitive stochastic computations can introduce
substantial and systematic errors.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Singularity Theory, a topological approach to concurrent program analysis, using algebraic topology to detect deadlocks and livelocks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like model checking have limitations regarding exhaustive state exploration for verifying concurrent programs.

Method: Models execution space as a branched topological space and uses algebraic topology tools like homotopy and homology groups to characterize and detect program singularities.

Result: Defines concurrent topological invariants for systematic detection and classification of deadlocks and livelocks.

Conclusion: Establishes a geometric and topological framework for concurrent program analysis, aiming to improve over traditional verification methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel paradigm for the analysis and verification of
concurrent programs -- the Singularity Theory. We model the execution space of
a concurrent program as a branched topological space, where program states are
points and state transitions are paths. Within this framework, we characterize
deadlocks as attractors and livelocks as non-contractible loops in the
execution space. By employing tools from algebraic topology, particularly
homotopy and homology groups, we define a series of concurrent topological
invariants to systematically detect and classify these concurrent
"singularities" without exhaustively traversing all states. This work aims to
establish a geometric and topological foundation for concurrent program
verification, transcending the limitations of traditional model checking.

### [263] [Have a thing? Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25369)
*Elliot Bobrow,Bryan Ford,Stefan Milenković*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GA is introduced as a new logical foundation enabling direct expression of general-recursive functions by handling nonterminating computations without inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical and intuitionistic logics struggle with reasoning about computation due to issues with general-recursive functions causing inconsistency.

Method: GA modifies inference rules so nonterminating computations denote 'bottom' (no value), allowing recursive functions to be dynamically typed or reverse-executed symbolically for termination proofs.

Result: Consistency of GA's quantifier-free fragment is proven in Isabelle/HOL, and quantifiers can be added safely without introducing inconsistencies.

Conclusion: GA demonstrates the potential to integrate arbitrary recursive definitions into formal systems while maintaining consistency.

Abstract: Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are
perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that
neither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of
arbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce
grounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation
for formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive
definitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that
express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e.,
"bottom") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive
functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing"
terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they
denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven
terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar
classical rules. A mechanically-checked consistency proof in Isabelle/HOL
exists for the basic quantifier-free fragment of GA. Quantifiers may be added
atop this foundation as ordinary computations, whose inference rules are thus
admissible and do not introduce new inconsistency risks. While GA is only a
first step towards richly-typed grounded deduction practical for everyday use
in manual or automated computational reasoning, it shows the promise that the
expressive freedom of arbitrary recursive definition can in principle be
incorporated into formal systems.

*Anil Yildiz,Sarah M. Thornton,Carl Hildebrandt,Sreeja Roy-Singh,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT enables efficient and scalable evaluation of scenario coverage for autonomous agents, using latent sensor representations instead of relying on expensive LVLMs or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scenario coverage methods for autonomous agents are expensive and inefficient, relying on human annotations or LVLMs.

Method: SCOUT is a lightweight surrogate model that uses latent sensor representations and is trained via a distillation process to approximate LVLM-generated labels.

Result: SCOUT achieves high accuracy in scenario coverage estimation while reducing computational cost, tested on autonomous navigation scenarios.

Conclusion: SCOUT is a practical tool for scalable coverage analysis, improving cost-efficiency and paving the way for better scenario evaluation in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a quadratic programming method using piece-wise quadratic Bezier curves for smooth robot path planning, demonstrating enhanced robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots need smooth, optimized, and safe paths for real-time navigation, but traditional methods face limitations in trajectory deviations, robustness, and practical scalability.

Method: The approach uses quadratic programming with piece-wise quadratic Bezier curves and safety margins to balance smoothness, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Result: Simulations show improved path quality, reduced trajectory deviations, and enhanced robustness compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively scales to real-time applications and improves mobile robot navigation performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient quadratic programming
(QP) approach for generating smooth, $C^1$ continuous paths for mobile robots
using piece-wise quadratic Bezier (PWB) curves. Our method explicitly
incorporates safety margins within a structured optimization framework,
balancing trajectory smoothness and robustness with manageable numerical
complexity suitable for real-time and embedded applications. Comparative
simulations demonstrate clear advantages over traditional piece-wise linear
(PWL) path planning methods, showing reduced trajectory deviations, enhanced
robustness, and improved overall path quality. These benefits are validated
through simulations using a Pure-Pursuit controller in representative
scenarios, highlighting the practical effectiveness and scalability of our
approach for safe navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in real-time quality assurance in additive manufacturing by integrating robotics and intelligent systems.

Method: Development of a closed-loop thermal control mechanism and in-situ defect correction system using a robot arm and vision system. Motion control is achieved through ROS2, and defects are autonomously corrected using computer vision.

Result: Experimental validation showed successful defect mitigation during printing, maintaining quality in real-time without interruptions.

Conclusion: The system combines thermal regulation, robotic motion control, and defect correction to create a scalable manufacturing framework suitable for various industries.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated robotic fused deposition modeling additive
manufacturing system featuring closed-loop thermal control and intelligent
in-situ defect correction using a 6-degree of freedom robotic arm and an Oak-D
camera. The robot arm end effector was modified to mount an E3D hotend
thermally regulated by an IoT microcontroller, enabling precise temperature
control through real-time feedback. Filament extrusion system was synchronized
with robotic motion, coordinated via ROS2, ensuring consistent deposition along
complex trajectories. A vision system based on OpenCV detects layer-wise
defects position, commanding autonomous re-extrusion at identified sites.
Experimental validation demonstrated successful defect mitigation in printing
operations. The integrated system effectively addresses challenges real-time
quality assurance. Inverse kinematics were used for motion planning, while
homography transformations corrected camera perspectives for accurate defect
localization. The intelligent system successfully mitigated surface anomalies
without interrupting the print process. By combining real-time thermal
regulation, motion control, and intelligent defect detection & correction, this
architecture establishes a scalable and adaptive robotic additive manufacturing
framework suitable for aerospace, biomedical, and industrial applications.

*Hayato Idei,Tamon Miyake,Tetsuya Ogata,Yuichi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network inspired by predictive processing, capable of performing caregiving tasks without task-specific feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for autonomous caregiving robots has increased due to aging societies, but current systems are task-specific and lack the ability to generalize across various scenarios.

Method: A neural network model based on the hierarchical predictive processing theory and free-energy principle was developed to handle high-dimensional sensory inputs and perform caregiving tasks.

Result: The model successfully learned caregiving tasks without task-specific engineering, demonstrated hierarchical latent dynamics, robustness to sensory degradation, and asymmetric interference in multitask learning.

Conclusion: Predictive processing provides a scalable computational principle for developing robust and flexible caregiving robots, with implications for understanding adaptability in the human brain.

Abstract: The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care
robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on
handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse
scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the
human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which
underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory
signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal
recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the
free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional
visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was
able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and
flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We
demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent
dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,
and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through
visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in
multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on
repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest
reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.
Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish
predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,
pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while
offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible
adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.

### [268] [Non-Invasive Calibration Of A Stewart Platform By Photogrammetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25072)
*Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new calibration method for Stewart platforms using forward kinematics and photogrammetry demonstrated improved pose accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating Stewart platforms effectively is challenging due to their complex kinematics and multiple solutions in forward kinematics.

Method: The authors developed a non-invasive calibration method using Denavit-Hartenberg convention, photogrammetry for pose measurement, and Least-Squared compensation strategies.

Result: All three compensation strategies showed noticeable improvements in the platform's pose accuracy using experimentally collected data.

Conclusion: The calibration method is effective and has potential for further improvements in precision and efficiency of Stewart platforms.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and
efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward
kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally
generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving
platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths
connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the
difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.
The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using
Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1
developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based
calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational
upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used
their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted
three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve
the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution
digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving
platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any
additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the
hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves
multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position
and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The
Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations
are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.
Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable
enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further
improvements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper reviews recent advancements in achieving assignment-free collaboration in robot swarms for efficient shape formation and other applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emulate swarm intelligence observed in nature for enhancing collaboration efficiency and robustness in robot swarms, addressing challenges in scalability and algorithm design.

Method: The paper introduces the 'mean-shift exploration' strategy as a theoretical approach to overcome inefficiencies in large-scale swarm collaboration.

Result: The mean-shift exploration strategy improves swarm collaboration efficiency significantly, particularly with increasing swarm sizes.

Conclusion: The strategy showcases practical applications such as precise shape formation, area coverage, and maneuvering formation, relevant to industrial sectors like smart warehousing, exploration, and transportation.

Abstract: Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are
commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more
efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in
engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms
that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played
an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot
swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and
robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a
tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot
swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component
is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which
improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.
Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale
increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the
mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area
coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding
industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo
transportation.

*Jiahong Chen,Jing Wang,Long Chen,Chuwei Cai,Jinghui Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Nano-scale Vision-Language Action (NanoVLA) improves robotic manipulation on edge devices by being lightweight with advanced features, providing faster inference and similar or better accuracy compared to heavy VLA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Vision-Language-Action models are computationally demanding, hindering deployment on constrained devices like embedded systems and mobile robots.

Method: NanoVLA innovates with vision-language decoupling, long-short action chunking, and dynamic routing, optimizing inference and adapting to task complexity for edge deployment.

Result: Experiments confirm up to 52x faster inference, 98% fewer parameters, and maintained or improved task accuracy compared to traditional VLA models.

Conclusion: NanoVLA enables efficient, high-precision robotic manipulation on resource-constrained devices, bridging the gap between performance and practical deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders
into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin
Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in
real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are
critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action
(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high
performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)
vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language
inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling
caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action
chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing
real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns
lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing
inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as
real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster
inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,
with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy
and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy
preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances
cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic
manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OrderMind is a manipulation ordering framework using a spatial-aware model to handle cluttered environments effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often neglect spatial relationships among objects, resulting in inefficiencies in manipulating cluttered environments.

Method: OrderMind introduces a novel architecture combining a spatial context encoder, temporal priority module, and k-Nearest Neighbors graph for real-time spatial modeling. A spatial prior labeling method guides a vision-language model for plausible order learning.

Result: OrderMind significantly outperforms existing methods in effectiveness and efficiency, as validated by extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: OrderMind's spatial-aware framework successfully addresses manipulation challenges in cluttered environments, offering robust real-time performance.

Abstract: Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial
dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause
collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial
relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these
limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation
ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on
spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a
temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using
k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout
and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support
accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and
semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior
labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable
manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation
Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and
efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SoraNav, a UAV navigation framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with geometry-aware decision-making to improve navigation in both 2.5D and 3D environments, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for UAV navigation, especially in small-scale 3D environments where existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) methods for ground robots struggle to adapt.

Method: The authors developed SoraNav, an adaptive framework that integrates zero-shot reasoning from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with geometry-aware decision-making. The system uses geometric priors for better spatial grounding and implements a hybrid strategy that switches between VLM reasoning and geometry-based exploration to improve navigation efficiency.

Result: SoraNav demonstrated a 25.7% increase in Success Rate (SR) and a 17% improvement in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) in 2.5D scenarios. In 3D scenarios, it showed a 29.5% SR improvement and an 18.5% SPL improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: The integration of VLM reasoning with geometry-aware decision-making in SoraNav enhances UAV navigation capabilities, particularly in complex 3D environments, providing a significant performance boost.

Abstract: Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for
complex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite
recent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly
for UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation
(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to
generalize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The
emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,
enables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,
these models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to
navigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive
UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with
geometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image
annotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A
hybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM
reasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant
revisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital
twin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental
results show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by
25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it
improves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.

Conclusion: Publicly accessible dataset aims to advance traffic management, infrastructure improvement, and smart transportation research.

Abstract: It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance
safety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various
built-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess
road quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of
high-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created
by a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation
sensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information
System (GIS) data with weather information and video footage of road
conditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of road issues with
geographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road
conditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,
rotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial
context provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide
funding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure
development, road safety, and urban planning. Additionally, the dataset will be
publicly accessible to promote further research and innovation in smart
transportation systems.

*Jee Won Lee,Hansol Lim,Sooyeun Yang,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid vision-based control framework combining lightweight methods and deep learning to maintain robust target tracking under occlusions in robot manipulation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in robust target tracking in vision-based robot manipulation systems, particularly under partial or full occlusions.

Method: A hybrid visual tracking pipeline with: (1) fast global template matching, (2) deep-feature refinement using early VGG layers, (3) lightweight residual regression for local adjustments, and (4) a GRU-based predictor for extrapolation during occlusion. Outputs integrate directly into 30Hz servo control loops.

Result: The system achieves robust tracking with less than 2px error under conditions of up to 90% occlusion, validated on handheld video sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines advanced perception with real-time servo control, providing robust low-latency tracking vital for reliable robot vision applications.

Abstract: Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),
have been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent
challenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full
occlusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking
but are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches
often require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these
gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced
perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher
constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module
operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);
then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by
texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a

*Hao Huang,Geeta Chandra Raju Bethala,Shuaihang Yuan,Congcong Wen,Anthony Tzes,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for training humanoid motion policies using one non-walking target motion and walking motions, reducing the need for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid motion training methods are data-intensive and labor-intensive, requiring many samples per motion category.

Method: They use order-preserving optimal transport to compute distances between sequences, interpolate via geodesics, optimize configurations, and apply reinforcement learning for policy training.

Result: Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap dataset show the proposed method outperforms baselines with better performance metrics.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces dataset collection efforts and achieves high-quality humanoid motion training with minimal samples.

Abstract: Whole-body humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics,
integrating balance, coordination, and adaptability to enable human-like
behaviors. However, existing methods typically require multiple training
samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human
motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a
single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking
motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to
compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by
interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons,
which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to
the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy
training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap
dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines,
achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulties of handling containers with liquid using robots, specifically optimizing for minimal liquid spillage in trajectory planning and control.

Method: The paper incorporates sloshing dynamics into the dynamic model and utilizes a direct multiple shooting approach to solve the optimization control problem.

Result: The proposed method plans an optimal trajectory that minimizes liquid spillage while transporting the liquid-filled container along a prescribed path in the shortest time.

Conclusion: This approach enables robotic manipulators to handle liquid-filled containers more effectively, improving precision and reducing spillage during transport tasks.

Abstract: Handling loosely placed objects with robotic manipulators is a difficult task
from the point of view of trajectory planning and control. This becomes even
more challenging when the object to be handled is a container filled with
liquid. This paper addresses the task of transporting a liquid-filled cup
placed on a tray along a prescribed path in shortest time. The objective is to
minimize swapping, thus avoiding spillage of the fluid. To this end, the
sloshing dynamics is incorporated into the dynamic model used within the
optimal control problem formulation. The optimization problem is solved using a
direct multiple shooting approach.

*Wang zhi,Yuyan Liu,Liu Liu,Li Zhang,Ruixuan Lu,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SynHLMA is a framework for generating hand grasp and manipulation sequences for articulated objects based on language instructions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating precise and context-aware hand-object interaction sequences, especially considering object functionality and deformation during manipulation.

Method: The paper introduces a framework called SynHLMA, combining discrete hand-object interaction representation, natural language embeddings, and a joint-aware loss to synchronize manipulation sequences with language instructions.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior results in generation, prediction, and interpolation of hand-object interaction sequences, shown through evaluation on the newly developed HAOI-lang dataset.

Conclusion: SynHLMA advances the understanding and synthesis of hand-object manipulations, with potential applications in robotics and embodied AI, and its datasets and codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.

*Yusuke Tsunoda,Seiya Yamamoto,Kazuki Ito,Runze Xiao,Keisuke Naniwa,Koichi Osuka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a centipede-inspired robot designed for both land and water navigation using a unified control scheme, focusing on leg structure to achieve efficient locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in designing multi-environment gaits and controllers for robots, particularly aiming to simplify transitions between land and water.

Method: Developed a centipede-type robot with flexible joints and various leg structures, testing locomotion on land and water while evaluating slip rate and energy consumption.

Result: Experimental results identified an effective leg structure capable of navigating both environments seamlessly under a unified control system.

Conclusion: A unified design approach using a suitable leg structure enables efficient navigation across both terrestrial and aquatic environments.

Abstract: Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain
environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility,
and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating
between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy
employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait
for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits
for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller
switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research
develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and
terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the
implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's
body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible
joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg
structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper
evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three
developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy
consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the
existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic
and terrestrial environments under identical control.

*Jakob Ziegler,Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores a method for gait assistance using a lower body exoskeleton that combines transparency and motion assistance, demonstrating promising preliminary results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for effective gait assistance in robotic exoskeletons by integrating modes for natural motion and support.

Method: Combines transparency (minimal interaction forces using gear backlash) and motion assistance (torque guiding legs based on adaptive oscillators for learning locomotion signals).

Result: Experiments on gait assistance demonstrated successful implementation with encouraging outcomes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows potential for enhancing exoskeleton technology, paving the way for advanced gait assistance systems.

Abstract: In this paper, an approach for gait assistance with a lower body exoskeleton
is described. Two concepts, transparency and motion assistance, are combined.
The transparent mode, where the system is following the user's free motion with
a minimum of perceived interaction forces, is realized by exploiting the gear
backlash of the actuation units. During walking a superimposed assistance mode
applies an additional torque guiding the legs to their estimated future
position. The concept of adaptive oscillators is utilized to learn the
quasi-periodic signals typical for locomotion. First experiments showed
promising results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective, compact, and mechanically robust alternative to traditional calibration methods like laser trackers or motion capture systems.

Method: Utilizes a calibration plate with known distances between points and relative measurements for error parameter determination. Methods include least squares and constrained optimization.

Result: Experiments showcased promising results with accuracy comparable to laser tracker calibration, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration method offers a practical and efficient solution for robot calibration, applicable to various robotics systems beyond gantry machines.

Abstract: In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced,
which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its
measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the
calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the
system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker
or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically
robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to
its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical
description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters
are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least
squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The
functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to
promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The
modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry
machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.

*Kei Ikemura,Yifei Dong,David Blanco-Mulero,Alberta Longhini,Li Chen,Florian T. Pokorny*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-based reinforcement learning method for gently manipulating deformable, fragile objects using stress-penalized rewards, achieving notable reductions in damage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating fragile and deformable objects without causing damage is challenging due to stress sensitivities. Existing solutions often rely on complex models and setups which lack scalability.

Method: The method integrates a vision-based reinforcement learning framework with stress-penalized rewards. Learning is boosted using offline demonstrations and curriculum design, progressing from rigid proxies to deformable objects.

Result: The approach demonstrated reduced stress on fragile objects (by 36.5%) while achieving task goals. Policies learned in simulation transferred effectively to real-world scenarios in a zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: The learned policies improve damage-aware, gentle manipulation effectiveness, showcasing significant potential in robotic handling of delicate objects.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects presents significant
challenges, as excessive stress can lead to irreversible damage to the object.
While existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors
and grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address
this problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that
incorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object
explicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline
demonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies
to deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and
real-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be
transferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as
picking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit
a damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness
by decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving
the task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.

### [283] [Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25422)
*Chaz Cornwall,Jeremy P. Bos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formation planner for multi-robot systems to minimize discrepancies between maintaining a predefined formation shape and reducing the original cost functions, demonstrating significant cost reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static shapes in multi-robot formation control often fail to minimize original costs, especially when environment details change.

Method: The paper introduces a two-step optimization approach to achieve desired relative robot positions, using weighted surrogate cost functions and Lyapunov-derived controllers.

Result: Simulation results show that the proposed method reduces individual costs by over 75% and multi-cost functions simultaneously by 20-40%.

Conclusion: Using formation planning with adaptive weights enhances performance in cost optimization for multi-robot systems compared to static shape abstractions.

Abstract: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by
encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing
complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining
the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or
Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.
When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a
static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose
a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost
function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation
planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative
robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear
and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.
We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do
not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized
using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are
realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's
direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for
military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,
we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When
minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation
planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning
provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that
closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape
abstraction.

TL;DR: This paper presents a Newton-Euler formulation for underwater vehicles with internal moving masses, validated through simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve modeling of underwater vehicles equipped with internal actuators by leveraging the Newton-Euler approach.

Method: The authors extend the maneuvering model for underwater vehicles using a body-frame description and kinematic equations, incorporating Coriolis-centripetal effects and hydrostatics.

Result: The Newton-Euler model is validated through simulation and compared to the Hamiltonian formulation.

Conclusion: The model provides an effective alternative to traditional approaches for underwater vehicle dynamics, ensuring detailed representation and validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of
motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator.
Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the
manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen
(1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and
included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the
coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal
effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived
using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through
simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass
actuator formulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores octopus arm-like motions and their whip-like dynamics in water, determining the role of passive dynamics and surrounding medium in replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand the efficient control mechanisms behind the octopus's highly deformable arm movements, considering their resemblance to whip-like dynamics.

Method: The study involved platform-based whipping tests in water and air, with variation in material stiffness and driving speed, and compared the resulting data to the biological movement of octopuses.

Result: The tests showed that Ecoflex Gel 2 at specific settings replicated some octopus arm dynamics, but differed in key aspects such as bend-point velocity and its behavior in water vs. air.

Conclusion: Octopus reaching movement relies on more than passive dynamics and is influenced heavily by the surrounding medium; this research advances the understanding of its kinematic principles and offers avenues for hydrodynamic research.

Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing
attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous
studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying
principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether
whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features
observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.
Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while
systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based
quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor
speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus
reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than
exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus
reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of
propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding
medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new
perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential
platform for future hydrodynamic research.

*Muyang Yan,Miras Mengdibayev,Ardon Floros,Weihang Guo,Lydia E. Kavraki,Zachary Kingston*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes VIZ-COAST, a method for using Vision-Language Models to predict and reduce refinement failures in task and motion planning (TAMP), leading to reduced planning times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In TAMP, task planning relies on abstractions that may not always be downwardly refinable into continuous motion. This can result in failures during motion planning and require costly replanning. Existing approaches reduce infeasibility but often only address issues post-failure, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduced VIZ-COAST, a technique that employs large pretrained Vision-Language Models to perform spatial reasoning and proactively detect potential task refinement issues. This removes refinement failures before they occur during planning.

Result: Experiments in two challenging TAMP domains demonstrate that VIZ-COAST significantly reduces planning time and, in some cases, eliminates refinement failures altogether. It also generalizes well to diverse domain instances.

Conclusion: VIZ-COAST improves TAMP by leveraging Vision-Language Models for spatial reasoning to preemptively address refinement issues, leading to more efficient and reliable planning.

Abstract: In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an
abstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics
problems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the
downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a
domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may
ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in
slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement
issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches
only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search
effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the
common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to
identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix
these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains
show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and
domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,
eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse
range of instances from the broader domain.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel hierarchical framework for bimanual manipulation by integrating skill planning and scheduling, featuring RL-trained primitive skills and a Transformer-based planner, achieving higher success rates and better coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of long-horizon, contact-rich bimanual manipulation, which requires effective coordination between arms beyond sequential decision-making approaches.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical framework that integrates skill planning and scheduling. It employs a library of primitive skills trained via Reinforcement Learning and a Transformer-based planner trained on a dataset of skill compositions to predict discrete skill schedules and continuous parameters.

Result: The proposed method surpasses end-to-end RL approaches in success rates for complex tasks and outperforms sequential-only planners in efficiency and coordination.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework enables improved performance in bimanual manipulation through simultaneous skill scheduling and parameter optimization, demonstrating the value of integrating skill planning and scheduling.

Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant
challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel
execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we
introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated
skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential
decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built
upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a
Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a
high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills
as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves
higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL
approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional
sequential-only planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MAPF research focuses only on collisions and travel time, neglecting energy consumption. This paper aims to fill that gap while optimizing path planning for AGVs.

Method: A new collision avoidance strategy is introduced and two multi-objective algorithms—NSGA and ALNS—are developed for task assignment.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing approaches in collision avoidance and task assignment, achieving better energy efficiency alongside travel time reduction.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that considering energy consumption can enhance MAPF for AGVs, with improved collision avoidance and task assignment.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most
research focusing on minimizing collisions and travel time. This paper also
considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles
(AGVs). It addresses two main challenges: i) resolving collisions between AGVs
and ii) assigning tasks to AGVs. We propose a new collision avoidance strategy
that takes both energy use and travel time into account. For task assignment,
we present two multi-objective algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm (NSGA) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). Comparative
evaluations show that these proposed methods perform better than existing
approaches in both collision avoidance and task assignment.

TL;DR: This paper modifies a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action model to enhance human-robot collaboration through improved perception, intent prediction, and action processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting for dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: The approach includes FiLM-based task-aware perception, auxiliary intent prediction, and refined action-space post-processing using delta actions and PCA-reduced hand joints.

Result: Delta actions exhibit stable behavior, with four principal components explaining ~96% of hand-joint variance. Ablation studies identify action post-processing as the primary performance driver.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time human-robot collaboration with efficient action processing, but trainer overfitting to specific demonstrators limits generalization.

Abstract: We adapt a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model (Open-VLA) for
dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting. Our
approach adds (i) FiLM conditioning to visual backbones for task-aware
perception, (ii) an auxiliary intent head that predicts collaborator hand pose
and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing that predicts compact
deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full
commands. Using a multi-view, teleoperated Franka and Mimic-hand dataset
augmented with MediaPipe hand poses, we demonstrate that delta actions are
well-behaved and that four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint
variance. Ablations identify action post-processing as the primary performance
driver; auxiliary intent helps, FiLM is mixed, and a directional motion loss is
detrimental. A real-time stack (~0.3 s latency on one RTX 4090) composes
"pick-up" and "pass" into a long-horizon behavior. We surface "trainer
overfitting" to specific demonstrators as the key limitation.

Motivation: To address the lack of datasets focusing on soft object manipulation and varying pressure conditions in robot learning.

Method: A dataset was collected via teleoperation using a humanoid robot with dexterous hands, capturing multi-modal interactions under diverse pressure conditions.

Result: The dataset provided allows researchers to explore advanced optimization strategies and the complexity of tactile signals in robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: This dataset will drive future innovations in robot learning models focusing on contact-rich manipulation of soft objects.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation has become increasingly important in robot

equipped with dexterous hands, capturing multi-modal interactions under varying

*Ciera McFarland,Margaret McGuinness*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a predictive model for the collapse of soft, vine-inspired robots, validated through experiments, enabling improved 3D navigation in confined spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of collapse in vine-inspired growing robots navigating gaps in confined environments.

Method: The authors developed a collapse model using shape information and tail tension to predict robot collapses, validated through experiments across various robot configurations and orientations.

Result: The model successfully predicted collapse trends and was tested for different orientations. It demonstrated the necessity of inflation for successful gap-crossing.

Conclusion: This model provides insights into collapse behavior, improving the design and navigation parameters for soft robots in open and complex environments.

Abstract: Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in
confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may
collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work,
we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length
of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension.
We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true
shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those
experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator
at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it
occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a
robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The
robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which
our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and
series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it
could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the
robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters
it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.

### [292] [GET-USE: Learning Generalized Tool Usage for Bimanual Mobile Manipulation via Simulated Embodiment Extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25754)
*Bohan Wu,Paul de La Sayette,Li Fei-Fei,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeT-USE introduces a method enabling robots to select and adapt tools for tasks, outperforming prior techniques by 30-60% in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots lack the ability to generalize tool usage, hindering their problem-solving versatility, especially when optimal tools are unavailable.

Method: GeT-USE first learns optimal tool geometries by extending robot embodiment in simulation, then transfers this strategy to real-world visuomotor policies.

Result: GeT-USE improves success rates in vision-based, real robot tool-usage tasks by 30-60%, using a bimanual manipulation system.

Conclusion: Simulated exploration of robot embodiment and learned geometric strategies effectively enhance real-world tool-usage capabilities in robots.

Abstract: The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a
missing piece in robots' intelligence today to boost their versatility and
problem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods
focused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a
task to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these
methods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with
the correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,
grasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,
especially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a
two-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by
learning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then
transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key
insight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building
new end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool
geometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can
then be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and
using the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22
degrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation
tool-usage tasks.

*Kush Hari,Ziyang Chen,Hansoul Kim,Ken Goldberg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces STITCH 2.0, a robotic system for surgical suturing, showcasing improvements in needle tracking, thread management, and wound closure rates, outperforming its predecessor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The wide variation in suturing skill among surgeons and the challenges with existing robotic suturing systems necessitate the development of a more precise and efficient system.

Method: This study develops STITCH 2.0 with seven major upgrades, including enhanced EKF needle pose estimation, innovative thread management techniques, and automated 3D suture alignment.

Result: Experimental trials exhibit an average of 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures per trial, significantly surpassing the performance of the previous system. Allowing human intervention increases sutures to six and achieves a 100% wound closure rate.

Conclusion: STITCH 2.0 demonstrates notable advancements in robotic surgical suturing, offering increased accuracy, efficiency, and wound closure capabilities, paving the way for enhanced robot-assisted surgeries.

Abstract: Surgical suturing is a high-precision task that impacts patient healing and
scarring. Suturing skill varies widely between surgeons, highlighting the need
for robot assistance. Previous robot suturing works, such as STITCH 1.0 [1],
struggle to fully close wounds due to inaccurate needle tracking and poor
thread management. To address these challenges, we present STITCH 2.0, an
elevated augmented dexterity pipeline with seven improvements including:
improved EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an
automated 3D suture alignment algorithm. Experimental results over 15 trials
find that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures
per trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the
previous baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0
averages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:

*Aofan Liu,Shiyuan Song,Haoxuan Li,Cehao Yang,Yiyan Qi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes RepoAlign-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level code retrieval based on change request scenarios, and ReflectCode, a new model architecture for this. The model shows significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern codebases are becoming increasingly complex, necessitating advanced retrieval systems capable of handling cross-component change intents, which conventional function-level search systems lack.

Method: The authors developed RepoAlign-Bench, a benchmark with 52k annotated instances, and ReflectCode, a dual-tower architecture that integrates syntactic patterns, function dependencies, and semantic intents via large language model-guided reflection.

Result: ReflectCode outperformed state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 12.2% improvement in Top-5 Accuracy and 7.1% in Recall.

Conclusion: ReflectCode and RepoAlign-Bench pave the way for holistic and context-aware code retrieval systems, addressing an existing gap in repository-level reasoning for complex change intents.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern codebases has intensified the need for
retrieval systems capable of interpreting cross-component change intents, a
capability fundamentally absent in conventional function-level search
paradigms. While recent studies have improved the alignment between natural
language queries and code snippets, retrieving contextually relevant code for
specific change requests remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce RepoAlign-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate repository-level code retrieval under change request driven scenarios,
encompassing 52k annotated instances. This benchmark shifts the retrieval
paradigm from function-centric matching to holistic repository-level reasoning.
Furthermore, we propose ReflectCode, an adversarial reflection augmented
dual-tower architecture featuring disentangled code_encoder and doc_encoder
components. ReflectCode dynamically integrates syntactic patterns, function
dependencies, and semantic expansion intents through large language model
guided reflection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ReflectCode
achieves 12.2% improvement in Top-5 Accuracy and 7.1% in Recall over
state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new direction for context-aware code
retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current AI tools in software engineering, such as cognitive overload, inefficient tool integrations, and constrained AI copilot capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes Compiler.next, a dynamic, search-based compiler system that transforms human-written intents into optimal software by optimizing parameters like prompts, cost, accuracy, and latency.

Result: Compiler.next provides a novel architecture for automating software development, with a focus on scalability, adaptability, and reliability, making software creation more accessible to non-experts.

Conclusion: Compiler.next establishes the potential to revolutionize software engineering through automated, AI-driven systems, lowering the technical barrier and enabling faster innovation in software development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-assisted software engineering has brought
transformative potential to the field of software engineering, but existing
tools and paradigms remain limited by cognitive overload, inefficient tool
integration, and the narrow capabilities of AI copilots. In response, we
propose Compiler.next, a novel search-based compiler designed to enable the
seamless evolution of AI-native software systems as part of the emerging
Software Engineering 3.0 era. Unlike traditional static compilers,
Compiler.next takes human-written intents and automatically generates working
software by searching for an optimal solution. This process involves dynamic
optimization of cognitive architectures and their constituents (e.g., prompts,
foundation model configurations, and system parameters) while finding the
optimal trade-off between several objectives, such as accuracy, cost, and
latency. This paper outlines the architecture of Compiler.next and positions it
as a cornerstone in democratizing software development by lowering the
technical barrier for non-experts, enabling scalable, adaptable, and reliable
AI-powered software. We present a roadmap to address the core challenges in
intent compilation, including developing quality programming constructs,
effective search heuristics, reproducibility, and interoperability between
compilers. Our vision lays the groundwork for fully automated, search-driven
software development, fostering faster innovation and more efficient AI-driven
systems.

*Vincenzo Scotti,Jan Keim,Tobias Hey,Andreas Metzger,Anne Koziolek,Raffaela Mirandola*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper suggests the creation of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called LLM Scripting Language (LSL) to improve the reliability, robustness, and trustworthiness of AI applications powered by Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but prone to generating unreliable and hallucinated content, which limits their use in automating workflows despite their potential.

Method: The authors propose developing an LLM Scripting Language (LSL) that specifies, verifies, and validates interactions with LLMs, helping enforce structure and control over generated outputs.

Result: This paper outlines a vision for LSL that integrates verification, validation, and explainability into LLM-powered systems to overcome issues of fragmentation and unreliability.

Conclusion: LSL could make interactions with LLMs programmable, reliable, and decoupled from their training or implementation, providing a pathway for more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: We are witnessing a bloom of AI-powered software driven by Large Language
Models (LLMs). Although the applications of these LLMs are impressive and
seemingly countless, their unreliability hinders adoption. In fact, the
tendency of LLMs to produce faulty or hallucinated content makes them
unsuitable for automating workflows and pipelines. In this regard, Software
Engineering (SE) provides valuable support, offering a wide range of formal
tools to specify, verify, and validate software behaviour. Such SE tools can be
applied to define constraints over LLM outputs and, consequently, offer
stronger guarantees on the generated content. In this paper, we argue that the
development of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for scripting interactions with
LLMs using an LLM Scripting Language (LSL) may be key to improve AI-based
applications. Currently, LLMs and LLM-based software still lack reliability,
robustness, and trustworthiness, and the tools or frameworks to cope with these
issues suffer from fragmentation. In this paper, we present our vision of LSL.
With LSL, we aim to address the limitations above by exploring ways to control
LLM outputs, enforce structure in interactions, and integrate these aspects
with verification, validation, and explainability. Our goal is to make LLM
interaction programmable and decoupled from training or implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in verifying complex data structure modules and address challenges posed by LLMs in handling Verus-specific annotations.

Method: The framework uses a planner module for abstraction generation and includes syntax guidance in prompts alongside a repair stage for correcting errors.

Result: VeriStruct successfully verified 10 out of 11 modules, achieving 99.2% accuracy across 129 functions.

Conclusion: VeriStruct is a significant step forward in automated AI-driven formal verification for complex data structures.

Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated
verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in
Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic
generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To
address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax
and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within
prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors.
In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on
ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in
total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic
AI-assisted formal verification.

*Mateen Ahmed Abbasi,Petri Ihantola,Tommi Mikkonen,Niko Mäkitalo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses AI's role in transforming Requirements Engineering (RE) using tools like LLMs and generative AI, proposing the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM) for ethical and efficient RE processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RE processes are manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone, necessitating AI-driven solutions to enhance efficiency and address complexities.

Method: The Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM) integrates AI-driven analysis and human oversight. The study employs a multi-phase methodology: preparing datasets, fine-tuning AI models, and designing workflows.

Result: The study introduces the HARE-SM conceptual framework and an early-stage prototype, paving the way for AI applications in RE.

Conclusion: The framework promotes ethical AI integration in RE, highlighting transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation while setting a research and design direction for collaborative RE environments.

Abstract: The future of Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly driven by
artificial intelligence (AI), reshaping how we elicit, analyze, and validate
requirements. Traditional RE is based on labor-intensive manual processes prone
to errors and complexity. AI-powered approaches, specifically large language
models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI, offer
transformative solutions and reduce inefficiencies. However, the use of AI in
RE also brings challenges like algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, and
ethical concerns related to automation. To address these issues, this study
introduces the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM), a conceptual framework that
integrates AI-driven analysis with human oversight to improve requirements
elicitation, analysis, and validation. The model emphasizes ethical AI use
through transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation. We outline a
multi-phase research methodology focused on preparing RE datasets, fine-tuning
AI models, and designing collaborative human-AI workflows. This preliminary
study presents the conceptual framework and early-stage prototype
implementation, establishing a research agenda and practical design direction
for applying intelligent data science techniques to semi-structured and

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BeTaL introduces a framework for dynamic benchmark design using LLMs to enhance evaluation processes, addressing the limitations of static and dynamic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for cost-efficient and evolving evaluation methods to assess model capabilities, as static benchmarks become saturated and dynamic benchmarks are expensive to update.

Method: BeTaL employs parameterization of benchmark design choices and uses LLMs to navigate the parameter space to create benchmarks with desired properties like difficulty and realism.

Result: BeTaL created two new benchmarks, extended a popular benchmark, and achieved benchmarks closer to desired difficulty levels, with deviations reduced by 2-4x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: BeTaL offers an effective way to automate dynamic benchmarking processes, improving alignment with evaluation goals and enhancing model assessment efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid progress and widespread deployment of LLMs and LLM-powered agents
has outpaced our ability to evaluate them. Hand-crafted, static benchmarks are
the primary tool for assessing model capabilities, but these quickly become
saturated. In contrast, dynamic benchmarks evolve alongside the models they
evaluate, but are expensive to create and continuously update. To address these
challenges, we develop BeTaL (Benchmark Tuning with an LLM-in-the-loop), a
framework that leverages environment design principles to automate the process
of dynamic benchmark design. BeTaL works by parameterizing key design choices
in base benchmark templates and uses LLMs to reason through the resulting
parameter space to obtain target properties (such as difficulty and realism) in
a cost-efficient manner. We validate this approach on its ability to create
benchmarks with desired difficulty levels. Using BeTaL, we create two new
benchmarks and extend a popular agentic benchmark $\tau$-bench. Extensive
evaluation on these three tasks and multiple target difficulty levels shows
that BeTaL produces benchmarks much closer to the desired difficulty, with
average deviations ranging from 5.3% to 13.2% -- a 2-4x improvement over the
baselines.

*Robin Maisch,Larissa Schmid,Timur Sağlam,Nils Niehues*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code plagiarism detection systems struggle against sophisticated obfuscation techniques like refactoring-based attacks. This paper introduces a framework utilizing code property graphs and graph transformations to enhance detection resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in identifying plagiarized code amidst increasingly advanced obfuscation techniques such as refactoring-based attacks in programming education.

Method: The framework employs code property graphs and graph transformations to counteract obfuscation approaches, testing real-world submissions against algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation techniques.

Result: The evaluation showed a notable improvement in the detection capabilities of the framework over existing systems against both algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation.

Conclusion: The framework provides enhanced detection resilience to sophisticated obfuscation, offering promise for improving plagiarism detection systems in programming education.

Abstract: Plagiarism detection in programming education faces growing challenges due to
increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques, particularly automated
refactoring-based attacks. While code plagiarism detection systems used in
education practice are resilient against basic obfuscation, they struggle
against structural modifications that preserve program behavior, especially
caused by refactoring-based obfuscation. This paper presents a novel and
extensible framework that enhances state-of-the-art detectors by leveraging
code property graphs and graph transformations to counteract refactoring-based
obfuscation. Our comprehensive evaluation of real-world student submissions,
obfuscated using both algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation attacks,
demonstrates a significant improvement in detecting plagiarized code.

*Minghai Lu,Zhe Zhou,Danning Xie,Songlin Jia,Benjamin Delaware,Tianyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adapt, a framework using LLMs to dynamically refine proofs in theorem proving, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling formal verification is difficult due to the manual effort and expertise required. LLMs offer potential but often generate incorrect proofs needing refinement.

Method: Adapt uses an LLM-guided decision-maker to select suitable refinement strategies dynamically based on proof context and assistant state.

Result: Evaluated across benchmarks, Adapt outperformed baselines by proving 16.63% and 18.58% more theorems. It demonstrated generalizability across multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: Adapt enhances proof generation by leveraging dynamic strategy selection, improving theorem proving efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Formal verification via theorem proving enables the expressive specification
and rigorous proof of software correctness, but it is difficult to scale due to
the significant manual effort and expertise required. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show potential in proof generation, they frequently produce
incorrect proofs on the first attempt and require additional strategies for
iterative refinement. However, existing approaches employ fixed refinement
strategies and cannot dynamically choose an effective strategy based on the
particular issues in a generated proof, which limits their performance. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Adapt, a novel proof refinement
framework that leverages an LLM-guided decision-maker to dynamically select a
suitable refinement strategy according to the state of the proof assistant and
available context of an incorrect proof. We evaluate Adapt on two benchmarks
against four existing methods and find that it significantly outperforms the
best baseline on both by proving 16.63% and 18.58% more theorems, respectively.
Furthermore, we demonstrate Adapt's generalizability by evaluating it across
five different LLMs. We also conduct ablation studies to measure the
contribution of each component and compare the trade-offs of alternative
decision-maker designs.

*Katsuki Yamagishi,Norihiro Yoshida,Erina Makihara,Katsuro Inoue*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces dcFix, a method for detecting and repairing REST API misuses using a Large Language Model (LLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging REST API misuses is challenging due to unclear error messages and a trial-and-error process during development.

Method: dcFix detects non-conforming code fragments in client programs, integrates them with API specifications into prompts, and utilizes a LLM to correct the code.

Result: dcFix achieves high accuracy in detecting misuses and surpasses baseline methods in performance.

Conclusion: dcFix offers an effective approach to automatically identify and repair REST API misuses, improving the debugging process.

Abstract: Many cloud services provide REST API accessible to client applications.
However, developers often identify specification violations only during
testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective
diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study
proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API
misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code
fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts,
and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our
evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms
the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code
fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.

*Shuochuan Li,Zan Wang,Xiaoning Du,Zhuo Wu,Jiuqiao Yu,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-intent code comment generation and introduces KUMIC, a framework utilizing Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning for more accurate intent-specific comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic code comments fail to cater to diverse needs of professionals, emphasizing the necessity for multi-intent comment generation, especially given the growing reliance on Large Language Models.

Method: KUMIC uses Chain-of-Thought and retrieval mechanisms to optimize code-comment relationships, enhancing in-context learning for generating intent-specific comments.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed existing baselines significantly in multiple metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SBERT.

Conclusion: KUMIC effectively improves multi-intent comment generation capabilities and sets a new benchmark for leveraging LLMs in code-comment tasks.

Abstract: Code comment generation aims to produce a generic overview of a code snippet,
helping developers understand and maintain code. However, generic summaries
alone are insufficient to meet the diverse needs of practitioners; for example,
developers expect the implementation insights to be presented in an untangled
manner, while users seek clear usage instructions. This highlights the
necessity of multi-intent comment generation. With the widespread adoption of
Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been
leveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation. Despite
their successes, state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches often struggle to
construct correct relationships among intents, code, and comments within a
smaller number of demonstration examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a
framework named KUMIC for multi-intent comment generation. Built upon
in-context learning, KUMIC leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to optimize
knowledge utilization for LLMs to generate intent-specific comments.
Specifically, KUMIC first designs a retrieval mechanism to obtain similar
demonstration examples, which exhibit high code-comment consistency. Then,
KUMIC leverages CoT to guide LLMs to focus on statements facilitating the
derivation of code comments aligned with specific intents. In this context,
KUMIC constructs a mapping knowledge chain, linking code to intent-specific
statements to comments, which enables LLMs to follow similar reasoning steps
when generating the desired comments. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate KUMIC, and the results demonstrate that KUMIC outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 14.49\%, 22.41\%, 20.72\%, and 12.94\% in terms
of BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SBERT, respectively.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TECS/Rust-OE, a scalable and memory-safe framework for embedded system design in IoT, addressing performance issues caused by excessive thread exclusion controls in the original TECS/Rust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in embedded systems like enhanced reliability and performance optimization, especially for IoT applications, by improving the TECS/Rust framework.

Method: TECS/Rust-OE utilizes real-time OS exclusive control and call flow mechanisms to optimize performance and ensure memory safety. Rust code is automatically generated based on component descriptions.

Result: The evaluations show reduced overhead due to optimized exclusion controls and demonstrate high reusability of the generated code.

Conclusion: The proposed TECS/Rust-OE framework successfully balances system performance and reliability, offering a scalable solution for complex IoT applications.

Abstract: The diversification of functionalities and the development of the IoT are
making embedded systems larger and more complex in structure. Ensuring system
reliability, especially in terms of security, necessitates selecting an
appropriate programming language. As part of existing research, TECS/Rust has
been proposed as a framework that combines Rust and component-based development
(CBD) to enable scalable system design and enhanced reliability. This framework
represents system structures using static mutable variables, but excessive
exclusive controls applied to ensure thread safety have led to performance
degradation. This paper proposes TECS/Rust-OE, a memory-safe CBD framework
utilizing call flows to address these limitations. The proposed Rust code
leverages real-time OS exclusive control mechanisms, optimizing performance
without compromising reusability. Rust code is automatically generated based on
component descriptions. Evaluations demonstrate reduced overhead due to
optimized exclusion control and high reusability of the generated code.

*Nao Yoshimura,Hiroshi Oyama,Takuya Azumi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TECS/Rust, a Rust-based framework for component-based development in embedded systems, enhancing memory safety and reducing programming vulnerabilities compared to C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of C in component-based development for embedded systems, such as memory vulnerabilities, while maintaining system efficiency and functionality.

Method: The authors developed TECS/Rust, integrating Rust's memory-safe features into the TECS framework. Automating Rust code generation and enabling integration with real-time operating systems were key components of this method.

Result: Evaluation found TECS/Rust generates a substantial portion of required code, with minimal execution overhead compared to traditional non-framework approaches.

Conclusion: TECS/Rust enhances memory safety in embedded systems without compromising efficiency, promoting safer and scalable development processes.

Abstract: As embedded systems grow in complexity and scale due to increased functional
diversity, component-based development (CBD) emerges as a solution to
streamline their architecture and enhance functionality reuse. CBD typically
utilizes the C programming language for its direct hardware access and
low-level operations, despite its susceptibility to memory-related issues. To
address these concerns, this paper proposes TECS/Rust, a Rust-based framework
specifically designed for TECS, which is a component framework for embedded
systems. It leverages Rust's compile-time memory-safe features, such as
lifetime and borrowing, to mitigate memory vulnerabilities common with C. The
proposed framework not only ensures memory safety but also maintains the
flexibility of CBD, automates Rust code generation for CBD components, and
supports efficient integration with real-time operating systems. An evaluation
of the amount of generated code indicates that the code generated by this paper
framework accounts for a large percentage of the actual code. Compared to code
developed without the proposed framework, the difference in execution time is
minimal, indicating that the overhead introduced by the proposed framework is
negligible.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the effectiveness of Property-based Testing (PBT) compared to Example-based Testing (EBT) in finding edge cases in LLM-generated code, suggesting a combination of both methods improves bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in code generation, ensuring the reliability of their outputs is crucial, especially in capturing defects and edge cases often missed by traditional Example-based Testing.

Method: The researchers compared PBT and EBT approaches using the Claude-4-sonnet model to analyze 16 HumanEval problems, particularly focusing on cases where standard code solutions failed extended tests.

Result: Both testing methods independently detected bugs at a 68.75% rate, but a combined approach improved the detection rate to 81.25%. Each method showed complementary strengths in identifying specific issues.

Conclusion: The complementary nature of PBT and EBT can be leveraged in a hybrid testing approach to enhance reliability and guidance in LLM-generated code testing strategies.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate code in software
development, ensuring the quality of LLM-generated code has become important.
Traditional testing approaches using Example-based Testing (EBT) often miss
edge cases -- defects that occur at boundary values, special input patterns, or
extreme conditions. This research investigates the characteristics of
LLM-generated Property-based Testing (PBT) compared to EBT for exploring edge
cases. We analyze 16 HumanEval problems where standard solutions failed on
extended test cases, generating both PBT and EBT test codes using
Claude-4-sonnet. Our experimental results reveal that while each method
individually achieved a 68.75\% bug detection rate, combining both approaches
improved detection to 81.25\%. The analysis demonstrates complementary
characteristics: PBT effectively detects performance issues and edge cases
through extensive input space exploration, while EBT effectively detects
specific boundary conditions and special patterns. These findings suggest that
a hybrid approach leveraging both testing methods can improve the reliability
of LLM-generated code, providing guidance for test generation strategies in
LLM-based code generation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Prometheus combines AI capabilities with modular software engineering principles to facilitate automated code verification, improving effectiveness compared to traditional baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification often requires specialized expertise, making it significantly more expensive and challenging compared to regular implementation. The study aimed to integrate AI to reduce costs and improve efficiency in formal verification.

Method: Prometheus breaks down complex program logic into smaller verifiable units using modular structuring. AI assists in verification, and users provide natural language guidance for steering proofs when automation is insufficient.

Result: Prometheus was able to verify 86% of tasks in the dataset, outperforming the baseline rate of 68%. Performance notably improved with higher specification complexity and integration of proof outlines.

Conclusion: By introducing modular restructuring and AI-assisted verification, Prometheus significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of formal code verification, offering a practical approach for tackling complex verification challenges.

Abstract: Formal verification is increasingly recognized as a critical foundation for
building reliable software systems. However, the need for specialized expertise
to write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn
annotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than
implementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical
proofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the
formal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a
novel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with
current AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering
principles (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing
complex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable
components. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof
of the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is
non-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through
structured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.
When automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural
language guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation
demonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code
substantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual
components. This approach successfully verifies 86% of tasks in our curated
dataset, compared to 68% for the baseline. Gains are more pronounced with
increasing specification complexity, improving from 30% to 69%, and when
integrating proof outlines for complex programs, from 25% to 87%.

*Ali Asgari,Annibale Panichella,Pouria Derakhshanfar,Mitchell Olsthoorn*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies challenges faced by developers in building AI agents by analyzing discussions on Stack Overflow, uncovering 77 specific technical issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are promising systems extending LLMs, yet developers face unexplored challenges in building, deploying, and maintaining these systems.

Method: The study analyzes Stack Overflow discussions using taxonomy construction, tag expansion, filtering, topic modeling (LDA-MALLET), and manual validation.

Result: Seven major recurring areas with 77 distinct challenges were identified, covering runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration complexity, and evaluation reliability.

Conclusion: Findings offer actionable insights for improving agent reliability and providing better developer support through guidance for practitioners, researchers, and educators.

Abstract: AI agents have rapidly gained popularity across research and industry as
systems that extend large language models with additional capabilities to plan,
use tools, remember, and act toward specific goals. Yet despite their promise,
developers face persistent and often underexplored challenges when building,
deploying, and maintaining these emerging systems. To identify these
challenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's
largest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and
answers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges
through tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and
manually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven
major areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges
related to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration
complexity, and evaluation reliability. We further quantify topic popularity
and difficulty to identify which issues are most common and hardest to resolve,
map the tools and programming languages used in agent development, and track
their evolution from 2021 to 2025 in relation to major AI model and framework
releases. Finally, we present the implications of our results, offering
concrete guidance for practitioners, researchers, and educators on agent
reliability and developer support.

*Florian Angermeir,Maximilian Amougou,Mark Kreitz,Andreas Bauer,Matthias Linhuber,Davide Fucci,Fabiola Moyón C.,Daniel Mendez,Tony Gorschek*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reproducibility of empirical studies involving Large Language Models (LLMs) published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. It finds that reproducibility issues are prevalent and suggests improvements in study design and artefact evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing interest in LLMs and the challenges in conducting reproducible research with these models, which are critical for academic credibility and practical application.

Method: The authors examined 86 articles focused on LLMs from ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. They assessed the reproducibility of 18 studies that provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models, attempting to replicate the results.

Result: Out of 18 attempted replications, only five studies were deemed fit for reproduction, and none were fully reproducible. Two studies were partially reproducible, while three were not reproducible at all.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the need for enhanced evaluation of research artefacts and improvements in study designs to ensure future LLM research is reproducible.

Abstract: Large Language Models have gained remarkable interest in industry and
academia. The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the
number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone
78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs.
Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions
on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and
practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on
LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current
research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede
reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We
contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide
insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on
how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles
describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86
articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted
to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for
reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the
results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did
not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for
stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs
to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.

*Ayse Irmak Ercevik,Aidan Dakhama,Melane Navaratnarajah,Yazhuo Cao,Leo Fernandes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GreenAFL is an energy-aware fuzzing framework aimed at reducing the environmental impact of software testing by incorporating power consumption into traditional fuzzing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational resource consumption and significant carbon footprint associated with existing grey-box fuzzing tools by introducing energy-efficient approaches.

Method: GreenAFL modifies traditional fuzzing workflows by introducing energy-aware corpus minimisation and energy-guided heuristics to reduce environmental impact while retaining testing coverage.

Result: The study demonstrated that GreenAFL achieves high coverage and significantly lower energy usage with its energy-focused modifications compared to vanilla AFL++.

Conclusion: Energy-aware modifications in fuzzing, such as those in GreenAFL, can effectively balance environmental impact and software testing performance, showing promise for greener testing solutions.

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a key search-based technique for software testing, but
continuous fuzzing campaigns consume substantial computational resources and
generate significant carbon footprints. Existing grey-box fuzzing approaches
like AFL++ focus primarily on coverage maximisation, without considering the
energy costs of exploring different execution paths. This paper presents
GreenAFL, an energy-aware framework that incorporates power consumption into
the fuzzing heuristics to reduce the environmental impact of automated testing
whilst maintaining coverage. GreenAFL introduces two key modifications to
traditional fuzzing workflows: energy-aware corpus minimisation considering
power consumption when reducing initial corpora, and energy-guided heuristics
that direct mutation towards high-coverage, low-energy inputs. We conduct an
ablation study comparing vanilla AFL++, energy-based corpus minimisation, and
energy-based heuristics to evaluate the individual contributions of each
component. Results show that highest coverage, and lowest energy usage is
achieved whenever at least one of our modifications is used.

### [311] [A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692)
*Tim Strnad,Blaž Bertalanič,Carolina Fortuna*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents LOCALIZE, a framework for radio localization ML experiments that emphasizes reproducibility, low-effort workflows, and extensibility, while addressing existing gaps in experiment workflows. It demonstrates practical utility with speed and scalability benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in making machine learning-based localization experiments reproducible, accessible, and extensible. Existing tools often fail to address the need for low coding effort, reproducibility by default, and extensibility in the workflows.

Method: LOCALIZE is introduced as a low-code, configuration-first framework for radio localization. It uses human-readable configurations, a workflow orchestrator, and artifact versioning, offering preconfigured datasets and clear extension points to minimize integration efforts.

Result: Through experiments, LOCALIZE shows reduced authoring effort while maintaining runtime and memory efficiency. It also demonstrates scalability for increasing training data sizes with minimal orchestration overheads.

Conclusion: LOCALIZE proves to be effective in making machine learning-based localization studies practical and reproducible, fostering more efficient, scalable, and extensible experimentation.

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization
services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should
make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,
without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers
face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low
coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default including
versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs,
and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models,
metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing
tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization
workflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,
configuration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are
declared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs
standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,
such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. The
preconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup and boilerplate,
speeding up model development and evaluation. The design, with clear extension
points, allows experts to add components without reworking the infrastructure.
In a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter
notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while
maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a
Bluetooth Low Energy dataset, we show that scaling across training data (1x to
10x) keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows. Overall, the
framework makes reproducible machine-learning-based localization
experimentation practical, accessible, and extensible.

*Jiayi Kuang,Yinghui Li,Xin Zhang,Yangning Li,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Ying Shen,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Enconda-bench, a benchmark focusing on diagnosing environment configuration capabilities in large language model-based agents, highlighting their process-level abilities during setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual effort and lack of high-quality datasets make environment configuration a bottleneck in software engineering using large language model-based agents.

Method: The benchmark uses automatically crafted tasks with README errors validated in Docker environments, assessing the agents' capabilities in planning, diagnosing, correcting, and finalizing configuration processes.

Result: Agents show good diagnostic abilities but struggle in corrective actions, limiting their overall end-to-end configuration success rates.

Conclusion: Enconda-bench advances capability assessment by focusing on internal processes rather than just aggregate success rates, providing insights to improve software engineering agents.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment
for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving
software engineering agents.

### [313] [An in-silico integration of neurodevelopmental and dopaminergic views of schizophrenia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24741)
*Xena Al-Hejji,Santina Duarte,Jose Guillermo Gomez Castro,Edgar Bermudez Contreras,Eric Chalmers*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep reinforcement learning model simulating schizophrenia by exploring excitation/inhibition imbalance and its effect on behavior, proposing that this, alongside neural noise, contributes to schizophrenia symptoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complex causes of schizophrenia, such as dopamine system dysfunction and abnormal neurodevelopment (excitation/inhibition imbalance), and simulating these mechanisms through computational modeling.

Method: Suppressed positive connections within an artificial neural network to mimic excitation/inhibition imbalance, and then introduced noise to observe its behavioral impact.

Result: The excitation/inhibition imbalance alone caused no behavioral change, but compensatory responses increased noise sensitivity, leading to schizophrenia-like behaviors.

Conclusion: Both E/I imbalance and neural noise could underlie key symptoms of schizophrenia, potentially bridging dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental explanations of the disorder's pathology.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have the potential to provide
new insights into psychiatric disorders. Here we create a DRL model of
schizophrenia: a complex psychotic disorder characterized by anhedonia,
avoidance, temporal discounting, catatonia, and hallucinations. Schizophrenia's
causes are not well understood: dopaminergic theories emphasize dopamine system
dysfunction, while neurodevelopmental theories emphasize abnormal connectivity,
including excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance in the brain. In this study, we
suppressed positive (excitatory) connections within an artificial neural
network to simulate E/I imbalance. Interestingly, this is insufficient to
create behavioral changes; the network simply compensates for the imbalance.
But in doing so it becomes more sensitive to noise. Injecting noise into the
network then creates a range of schizophrenic-like behaviours. These findings
point to an interesting potential pathology of schizophrenia: E/I imbalance
leads to a compensatory response by the network to increase the excitability of
neurons, which increases susceptibility to noise. This suggests that the
combination of E/I imbalance and neural noise may be key in the emergence of
schizophrenic symptoms. We further notice altered response to reward prediction
error in our model, and thus propose that E/I imbalance plus noise can account
for both schizophrenia symptoms and dopamine system dysfunction: potentially
unifying dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia
pathology.

*Pierre Gosselin,Aïleen Lotz*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a field-theoretic approach to describe dynamics in neuronal systems, integrating activity, connectivity, and hierarchical structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a coherent theoretical framework that explains the complex dynamics of collective neuronal states and their hierarchical interactions.

Method: The authors propose and analyze a field-theoretic formalism, incorporating activity levels, connectivity, internal frequencies, and activation classes within a dynamical system.

Result: The framework enables the study of stability, transitions between collective states, and the cascade of hierarchical structures within neuronal assemblies.

Conclusion: This unified nonlinear model advances understanding of emergent neuronal architectures and their interactions, facilitating the study of dynamic connectivity in hierarchical brain systems.

Abstract: We present a unified field-theoretic framework for the dynamics of activity
and connectivity in interacting neuronal systems. Building upon previous works,
where a field approach to activity--connectivity dynamics, formation of
collective states and effective fields of collective states were successively
introduced, the present paper synthesizes and extends these results toward a
general description of multiple hierarchical collective structures. Starting
with the dynamical system representing collective states in terms of
connections, activity levels, and internal frequencies, we analyze its
stability, emphasizing the possibility of transitions between configurations.
Then, turning to the field formalism of collective states, we extend this
framework to include substructures (subobjects) participating in larger
assemblies while retaining intrinsic properties. We define activation classes
describing compatible or independent activity patterns between objects and
subobjects, and study stability conditions arising from their alignment or
mismatch. The global system is described as the collection of landscapes of
coexisting and interacting collective states, each characterized both by
continuous (activity, frequency) and discrete (class) variables. A
corresponding field formalism is developed, with an action functional
incorporating both internal dynamics and interaction terms. This nonlinear
field model captures cascading transitions between collective states and the
formation of composite structures, providing a coherent theoretical basis for
emergent neuronal assemblies and their mutual couplings.

### [315] [Effect of an auditory static distractor on the perception of an auditory moving target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25119)
*Noa Kemp,Cynthia Tarlao,Catherine Guastavino,B. Suresh Krishna*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of revolving sounds beyond a certain speed, worsened by the presence of a static distractor sound. The effect depends on spectral overlap relevant to front-back discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the ability to track moving sounds is affected by static distractor sounds, which is important for real-life auditory perception in complex environments.

Method: The study examined the impact of distractor sounds on the upper limit of motion direction discrimination, using spectral manipulation to identify energetic masking effects.

Result: Distractor sounds reduced the upper limit of motion discrimination, mainly through spectral overlap causing energetic masking, rather than informational masking.

Conclusion: Distractors with spectral overlap impair tracking of moving sounds, providing insights into auditory motion perception amidst competing sounds.

Abstract: It is known that listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of
motion of a revolving sound (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) beyond a critical
velocity ("the upper limit"), primarily due to degraded front-back
discrimination. Little is known about how this ability is affected by
simultaneously present distractor sounds, despite the real-life importance of
tracking moving sounds in the presence of distractors. We hypothesized that the
presence of a static distractor sound would impair the perception of moving
target sounds and reduce the upper limit, and show that this is indeed the
case. A distractor on the right was as effective as a distractor at the front
in reducing the upper limit despite the importance of resolving front-back
confusions. By manipulating the spectral content of both the target and
distractor, we found that the upper limit was reduced if and only if the
distractor spectrally overlaps with the target in the frequency range relevant
for front/back discrimination; energetic masking thus explains the upper limit
reduction by the distractor. We did not find any evidence for informational
masking by the distractor. Our findings form the first steps towards a better
understanding of the tracking of multiple sounds in the presence of
distractors.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Introduces UnKGCP, a new framework for uncertain knowledge graph embedding (UnKGE) methods, which generates prediction intervals to capture predictive uncertainty with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UnKGE methods lack the ability to quantify predictive uncertainty, which is critical for high-stakes applications requiring confidence in predictions.

Method: The authors propose UnKGCP, based on the conformal prediction framework with a novel nonconformity measure and an efficient interval construction procedure.

Result: UnKGCP produces prediction intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true score with a user-specified confidence level and reflects predictive uncertainty. Experiments validate its sharpness and effectiveness across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: UnKGCP enhances UnKGE methods by reliably quantifying predictive uncertainty, making the framework suitable for applications where confidence in predictions is important.

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graph embedding (UnKGE) methods learn vector
representations that capture both structural and uncertainty information to
predict scores of unseen triples. However, existing methods produce only point
estimates, without quantifying predictive uncertainty-limiting their
reliability in high-stakes applications where understanding confidence in
predictions is crucial. To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{UnKGCP},
a framework that generates prediction intervals guaranteed to contain the true
score with a user-specified level of confidence. The length of the intervals
reflects the model's predictive uncertainty. \textsc{UnKGCP} builds on the
conformal prediction framework but introduces a novel nonconformity measure
tailored to UnKGE methods and an efficient procedure for interval construction.
We provide theoretical guarantees for the intervals and empirically verify
these guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks across diverse
UnKGE methods further demonstrate that the intervals are sharp and effectively
capture predictive uncertainty.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TreeHFD is introduced to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition of tree ensembles, addressing practical challenges in explainability for dependent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of tree ensembles and improve their explainability, especially in scenarios involving critical decisions.

Method: Introduced the TreeHFD algorithm to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition under dependent variables, ensuring orthogonality and sparsity.

Result: TreeHFD demonstrates convergence, orthogonality, sparsity, and causal variable selection, with high performance validated in various datasets.

Conclusion: TreeHFD provides a reliable method for decomposing tree ensembles, enabling better understanding and connection to established methods like TreeSHAP.

Abstract: Tree ensembles have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictive performance
across a wide range of problems involving tabular data. Nevertheless, the
black-box nature of tree ensembles is a strong limitation, especially for
applications with critical decisions at stake. The Hoeffding or ANOVA
functional decomposition is a powerful explainability method, as it breaks down
black-box models into a unique sum of lower-dimensional functions, provided
that input variables are independent. In standard learning settings, input
variables are often dependent, and the Hoeffding decomposition is generalized
through hierarchical orthogonality constraints. Such generalization leads to
unique and sparse decompositions with well-defined main effects and
interactions. However, the practical estimation of this decomposition from a
data sample is still an open problem. Therefore, we introduce the TreeHFD
algorithm to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition of a tree ensemble from a
data sample. We show the convergence of TreeHFD, along with the main properties
of orthogonality, sparsity, and causal variable selection. The high performance
of TreeHFD is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real data,
using our treehfd Python package (https://github.com/ThalesGroup/treehfd).
Besides, we empirically show that the widely used TreeSHAP method, based on
Shapley values, is strongly connected to the Hoeffding decomposition.

*Rafael Oliveira,Daniel M. Steinberg,Edwin V. Bonilla*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy using generative models for efficient batch Bayesian Optimization (BO), particularly in high-dimensional or complex design spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address challenges in scaling Bayesian Optimization for large batches, non-continuous design spaces, and high-dimensional problems.

Method: The method trains generative models to sample solution candidates based on a proposal distribution proportional to expected utility values, replacing the need for surrogate models.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments indicate that generative models trained this way converge towards global optima and perform successfully in challenging optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes direct preference optimization techniques and demonstrates potential for enhancing batch BO in complex scenarios without relying on surrogate models.

Abstract: We present a general strategy for turning generative models into candidate
solution samplers for batch Bayesian optimization (BO). The use of generative
models for BO enables large batch scaling as generative sampling, optimization
of non-continuous design spaces, and high-dimensional and combinatorial design.
Inspired by the success of direct preference optimization (DPO), we show that
one can train a generative model with noisy, simple utility values directly
computed from observations to then form proposal distributions whose densities
are proportional to the expected utility, i.e., BO's acquisition function
values. Furthermore, this approach is generalizable beyond preference-based
feedback to general types of reward signals and loss functions. This
perspective avoids the construction of surrogate (regression or classification)
models, common in previous methods that have used generative models for
black-box optimization. Theoretically, we show that the generative models
within the BO process approximately follow a sequence of distributions which
asymptotically concentrate at the global optima under certain conditions. We
also demonstrate this effect through experiments on challenging optimization
problems involving large batches in high dimensions.

*Maik Overmars,Jasper Goseling,Richard Boucherie*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the convergence of off-policy TD(0) with linear function approximation in reversible Markov chains, offering improved results without modifying the algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the issue of algorithm divergence arising from combining off-policy learning and function approximation in Markov chains, and simplify existing solutions which rely on importance sampling.

Method: The authors analyze the standard off-policy TD(0) algorithm under the condition of reversible Markov chains, leveraging stochastic approximation frameworks to derive explicit convergence guarantees.

Result: Convergence guarantees are established under mild reversibility assumptions and a bounded discount factor, achieving projected Bellman error of zero with probability one.

Conclusion: The findings improve upon prior literature, demonstrating that off-policy TD(0) is convergent under practical conditions for reversible Markov chains without algorithm modifications, and the process is illustrated using random walks.

Abstract: We study the convergence of off-policy TD(0) with linear function
approximation when used to approximate the expected discounted reward in a
Markov chain. It is well known that the combination of off-policy learning and
function approximation can lead to divergence of the algorithm. Existing
results for this setting modify the algorithm, for instance by reweighing the
updates using importance sampling. This establishes convergence at the expense
of additional complexity. In contrast, our approach is to analyse the standard
algorithm, but to restrict our attention to the class of reversible Markov
chains. We demonstrate convergence under this mild reversibility condition on
the structure of the chain, which in many applications can be assumed using
domain knowledge. In particular, we establish a convergence guarantee under an
upper bound on the discount factor in terms of the difference between the
on-policy and off-policy process. This improves upon known results in the
literature that state that convergence holds for a sufficiently small discount
factor by establishing an explicit bound. Convergence is with probability one
and achieves projected Bellman error equal to zero. To obtain these results, we
adapt the stochastic approximation framework that was used by Tsitsiklis and
Van Roy [1997 for the on-policy case, to the off-policy case. We illustrate our
results using different types of reversible Markov chains, such as
one-dimensional random walks and random walks on a weighted graph.

*Clemens Schächter,Maren Hackenberg,Michelle Pfaffenlehner,Félix B. Tambe-Ndonfack,Thorsten Schmidt,Astrid Pechmann,Janbernd Kirschner,Jan Hasenauser,Harald Binder*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to analyze longitudinal data from rare disease trials, addressing challenges caused by disjoint measurement instruments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare diseases often involve limited treatment options, necessitating statistical methods to evaluate treatment effects in trials with small sample sizes, complicated by changing measurement instruments over time.

Method: The paper utilizes variational autoencoder architectures to embed observations into a shared latent space, combined with mixed-effects regression models for temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch analysis.

Result: The method was applied to spinal muscular atrophy data, enabling alignment of motor performance items from different instruments and quantifying treatment switch effects.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles small data challenges in rare disease trials, demonstrating its potential in longitudinal analyses and treatment effect quantification.

Abstract: Many rare diseases offer limited established treatment options, leading
patients to switch therapies when new medications emerge. To analyze the impact
of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare
disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This,
however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the
observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age
ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the
application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression.
We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned
low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across
instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder
architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time
point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured
through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To
enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach
that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression
and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact
of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our
approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments
for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed
item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for
model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The
results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for
addressing small data challenges.

*Hugo Lavenant,Giacomo Zanella*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) for discrete data, focusing on their computational efficiency and sampling accuracy trade-offs. It introduces general error bounds regardless of sequence length and proposes optimized schedules for token generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computation and accuracy trade-offs in generative models for discrete data, particularly exploring the sampling bias and efficiency within newly proposed Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs).

Method: The authors derive general error bounds based on the average tokens generated per iteration, not sequence length. They propose optimized non-constant schedule sizes for token generation, grounded in data distribution profiles, and avoid classical derivations based on reversed diffusion processes.

Result: Results highlight that MDMs' performance can be supported by theoretical error bounds, which are independent of data dimensionality. Optimal schedules for generation processes based on information profiles offer insights into improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MDMs provide a favorable balance between computational efficiency and sampling accuracy. The proposed framework and analysis allow principled optimization of the generation schedules, enhancing MDM performance and transparency.

Abstract: Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked
Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to
reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the
price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting
computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative
entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per
iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence
length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the
gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of
unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal
schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data
distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We
define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical
derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and
transparent proofs.

### [322] [Monitoring the calibration of probability forecasts with an application to concept drift detection involving image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25573)
*Christopher T. Franck,Anne R. Driscoll,Zoe Szajnfarber,William H. Woodall*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cumulative sum-based monitoring method to detect calibration issues in machine learning classification models over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of methods for continually monitoring machine learning models' calibration as they operate over time, particularly for detecting context changes.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic cumulative sum (CUSUM)-based method that monitors probability predictions and event outcomes without requiring access to the machine learning model itself.

Result: This approach provides early detection of miscalibration and concept drift occurrences, strengthening operational reliability in image classification performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is versatile and applicable to any scenario requiring ongoing calibration monitoring of machine learning probability predictions, enhancing model reliability in dynamic contexts.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for image classification have led to impressive
advances in that field. For example, convolutional neural networks are able to
achieve remarkable image classification accuracy across a wide range of
applications in industry, defense, and other areas. While these machine
learning models boast impressive accuracy, a related concern is how to assess
and maintain calibration in the predictions these models make. A classification
model is said to be well calibrated if its predicted probabilities correspond
with the rates events actually occur. While there are many available methods to
assess machine learning calibration and recalibrate faulty predictions, less
effort has been spent on developing approaches that continually monitor
predictive models for potential loss of calibration as time passes. We propose
a cumulative sum-based approach with dynamic limits that enable detection of
miscalibration in both traditional process monitoring and concept drift
applications. This enables early detection of operational context changes that
impact image classification performance in the field. The proposed chart can be
used broadly in any situation where the user needs to monitor probability
predictions over time for potential lapses in calibration. Importantly, our
method operates on probability predictions and event outcomes and does not
require under-the-hood access to the machine learning model.

*Samet Demir,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes in-context learning (ICL) in Transformers with nonlinear MLP heads on tasks drawn from multiple data sources, extending theoretical insights to realistic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing theoretical analyses on ICL by exploring more realistic architectures and heterogeneous data/task distributions.

Method: The authors use a two-layer MLP analysis, leveraging high-dimensional asymptotics, Gaussian universality, and orthogonal polynomials to evaluate ICL performance and the benefits of nonlinear architectures.

Result: Nonlinear MLPs enhance ICL performance on nonlinear tasks compared to baseline linear models, reveal data mixing dynamics, and identify properties of high-quality data sources for improved learning.

Conclusion: Transformers with nonlinear MLPs improve ICL on complex tasks. Insights into architecture and data characteristics provide theoretical and practical advancements in ICL applications.

Abstract: Pretrained Transformers demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, enabling them to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without
parameter updates. However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified
architectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), data models (e.g., linear regression with
isotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to
realistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with
nonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with
heterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where
the MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single
gradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional
asymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to
structured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of
Gaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that
nonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear
tasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data
mixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low
noise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when
the task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated
empirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data
distributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving
multilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different
source. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings
extend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical
foundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the
role of architecture and data in ICL.

### [324] [E-Scores for (In)Correctness Assessment of Generative Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25770)
*Guneet S. Dhillon,Javier González,Teodora Pandeva,Alicia Curth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces e-values as an improvement over p-values for assessing the correctness of generative models' outputs, ensuring validity even when tolerance levels are chosen post-hoc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods (based on p-values) in evaluating generative models' correctness while avoiding issues like p-hacking.

Method: The authors use the conformal prediction framework along with e-values to provide statistical guarantees and flexibility in post-hoc error tolerance level decisions.

Result: The proposed method enables more robust correctness assessment of LLM outputs, demonstrated through experiments on mathematical factuality and property constraints.

Conclusion: E-values provide a principled mechanism for assessing incorrectness in generative models, ensuring statistical validity and practical adaptability.

Abstract: While generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), are
ubiquitous in today's world, principled mechanisms to assess their
(in)correctness are limited. Using the conformal prediction framework, previous
works construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an
incorrect response, or error, is capped at a desired user-defined tolerance
level. However, since these methods are based on p-values, they are susceptible
to p-hacking, i.e., choosing the tolerance level post-hoc can invalidate the
guarantees. We therefore leverage e-values to complement generative model
outputs with e-scores as a measure of incorrectness. In addition to achieving
the same statistical guarantees as before, e-scores provide users flexibility
in adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the e-scores
themselves, by upper bounding a post-hoc notion of error called size
distortion. We experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in assessing LLM
outputs for different correctness types: mathematical factuality and property
constraints satisfaction.

### [325] [CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24805)
*Alexandre St-Georges,Gabriel Richard,Maxime Toussaint,Christian Thibaudeau,Etienne Auger,Étienne Croteau,Stephen Cunnane,Roger Lecomte,Jean-Baptiste Michaud*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The study develops a method using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic CT images from non-attenuation-corrected PET scans, enhancing PET quantification accuracy without additional CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of photon attenuation in PET imaging which leads to inaccurate quantification and potential misdiagnosis. Traditional CT-based corrections involve drawbacks like extra radiation exposure, spatial mismatches, and high costs.

Method: The authors propose using DDPMs to generate synthetic CT images based on non-attenuation-corrected PET data. This method employs three orthogonal views and ensemble voting to improve imaging quality and consistency.

Result: Their method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 ± 10.4 HU for synthetic CT images and an average reconstruction error of 1.48 ± 0.68% in regions of interest, demonstrating superior accuracy and reduced artifacts compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The DDPM-based approach provides a safer, cost-effective, and accurate alternative for attenuation correction in PET imaging, eliminating the need for additional CT scans.

Abstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential
for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue
encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution
of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching
detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal
degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to
differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to
misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed
Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon
attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to
extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial
misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment
infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an
alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation
reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can
generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in
order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from
non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble
voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and
improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans
acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method
achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an
average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when
comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated
pseudo-CT versus the true CT.

TL;DR: This paper introduces scMRDR, a scalable and flexible generative framework for unpaired multi-omics single-cell data integration, performing well on key tasks and scaling to large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating unpaired multi-omics single-cell data, particularly limitations in scalability and flexibility of existing approaches.

Method: The paper employs a $$-VAE architecture for disentangling modality-shared and modality-specific components of latent representations, enhanced with isometric regularization, adversarial objectives, and masked reconstruction loss.

Result: The proposed framework exhibits strong performance in batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation while scaling effectively to large datasets and supporting integration of multiple omics.

Conclusion: scMRDR offers a robust and scalable solution for integrating large-scale multi-omics data, facilitating advancements in biological discovery.

Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of
diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics
single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair
information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise
coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we
introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell
Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired
multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent
representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a
well-designed $\beta$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric
regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial
objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss
strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method
achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch
correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially,
it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more
than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale
multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that enables multi-agent systems to safely navigate dynamic environments while considering social awareness and achieving time-sensitive tasks.

Method: Utilized a dynamic spatiotemporal tube framework and developed a real-time online synthesis method with a closed-form control law focusing on modeling social interactions and safety.

Result: Achieved prescribed-time tasks with safety guarantees, collision avoidance, and robustness validated through simulations and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: The framework ensures multi-agent systems' safe, model-free task execution even in unknown, disturbance-prone environments, showcasing computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates
social awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve
prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is
assigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or
self-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system.
Building on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT
framework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its
social interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law
is derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby
avoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a
socially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The
proposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is
computationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances.
The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through
simulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional

TL;DR: The paper proposes a stability-constrained neural network architecture for identifying nonlinear systems using latent states and internal scheduling variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability of control systems by addressing challenges in capturing latent dynamics while ensuring system stability.

Method: A neural network-based state-space model with a Schur-stable parameterization and state-consistency regularization for training.

Result: The model outperforms classical subspace identification methods and recent gradient-based approaches on benchmark nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: The stability-constrained approach is scalable and reliable for modeling complex nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of nonlinear systems is essential for reliable control, yet
conventional identification methods often struggle to capture latent dynamics
while maintaining stability. We propose a \textit{stable-by-design LPV neural
network-based state-space} (NN-SS) model that simultaneously learns latent
states and internal scheduling variables directly from data. The
state-transition matrix, generated by a neural network using the learned
scheduling variables, is guaranteed to be stable through a Schur-based
parameterization. The architecture combines an encoder for initial state
estimation with a state-space representer network that constructs the full set
of scheduling-dependent system matrices. For training the NN-SS, we develop a
framework that integrates multi-step prediction losses with a state-consistency
regularization term, ensuring robustness against drift and improving
long-horizon prediction accuracy. The proposed NN-SS is evaluated on benchmark
nonlinear systems, and the results demonstrate that the model consistently
matches or surpasses classical subspace identification methods and recent
gradient-based approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
stability-constrained neural LPV identification as a scalable and reliable
framework for modeling complex nonlinear systems.

topology preservation. ORTSF integration into transformers achieves 14.7\%
perplexity reduction and 2.3 faster convergence on WikiText-103. We establish

TL;DR: The paper evaluates sample efficiency in de novo molecule generation by adapting benchmarks and proposes improvements for more realistic small-molecule drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in de novo molecule generation caused by the need for extensive data or expensive molecule scoring functions, which hinders drug design optimization.

Method: Adapt and redefine sample efficiency benchmarks to better reflect realistic objectives, factoring in key chemical properties and diversity, and re-evaluate existing generative models.

Result: Accounting for molecular weight and LogP significantly alters model rankings, with Augmented Hill-Climb methodology proving most effective in balancing sample efficiency and chemical desirability.

Conclusion: Improved sample efficiency and chemical quality could transform the integration of expensive computational scoring into practical drug design workflows.

Abstract: De novo molecule generation can suffer from data inefficiency; requiring
large amounts of training data or many sampled data points to conduct objective
optimization. The latter is a particular disadvantage when combining deep
generative models with computationally expensive molecule scoring functions
(a.k.a. oracles) commonly used in computer-aided drug design. Recent works have
therefore focused on methods to improve sample efficiency in the context of de
novo molecule drug design, or to benchmark it. In this work, we discuss and
adapt a recent sample efficiency benchmark to better reflect realistic goals
also with respect to the quality of chemistry generated, which must always be
considered in the context of small-molecule drug design; we then re-evaluate
all benchmarked generative models. We find that accounting for molecular weight
and LogP with respect to the training data, and the diversity of chemistry
proposed, re-orders the ranking of generative models. In addition, we benchmark
a recently proposed method to improve sample efficiency (Augmented Hill-Climb)
and found it ranked top when considering both the sample efficiency and
chemistry of molecules generated. Continual improvements in sample efficiency
and chemical desirability enable more routine integration of computationally
expensive scoring functions on a more realistic timescale.

Motivation: Stiff circuit modeling poses challenges in electronic design automation due to inefficient and inaccurate existing methods.

Method: The method combines the Crossformer model for time-series prediction with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for feature extraction, applied to transient behavior modeling of stiff circuits.

Crossformer's temporal representation capabilities and the enhanced feature
extraction of KANs, our method achieves improved fidelity in predicting circuit

TL;DR: The study establishes a precise relationship between discrete $$-graph energies and their continuum counterparts, introduces a neural-network approach for reconstructing connectivity density, and applies it to a brain-dynamic model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of $$-graphs' continuum limits and advance brain-dynamics modeling using spatially varying diffusion coefficients.

Method: Prove an error bound between the discrete graph energy and continuum model, then use neural networks to estimate connectivity density from edge-weight data.

Result: The learned density demonstrates strong local variations and leads to significantly altered dynamics in brain-dynamic models compared to constant diffusion models.

Conclusion: The paper shows how $$-graphs can transition to continuum models and provides insights for applications in brain dynamics with varying diffusion.

Abstract: We derive an energy-based continuum limit for $\varepsilon$-graphs endowed
with a general connectivity functional. We prove that the discrete energy and
its continuum counterpart differ by at most $O(\varepsilon)$; the prefactor
involves only the $W^{1,1}$-norm of the connectivity density as
$\varepsilon\to0$, so the error bound remains valid even when that density has
strong local fluctuations. As an application, we introduce a neural-network
procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and
then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework. In
this setting, the usual constant diffusion coefficient is replaced by the
spatially varying coefficient produced by the learned density, yielding
dynamics that differ significantly from those obtained with conventional
constant-diffusion models.

Motivation: To address the challenge of solving inverse and optimization problems related to nonlinear PDEs on complex spatial domains efficiently and with high accuracy.

Method: A spectral basis representation of solutions is introduced, using coefficients optimized via loss functions that incorporate equations, boundary conditions, and optimization targets, leveraging principles from Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

Result: Empirical results show that optimization protocols enable exponential convergence in problem-solving for a wide range of PDEs and allow for seamless data assimilation and optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and accurate framework for solving nonlinear PDEs on complex domains while supporting data integration and optimization over PDE solutions.

Abstract: Solving inverse and optimization problems over solutions of nonlinear partial
differential equations (PDEs) on complex spatial domains is a long-standing
challenge. Here we introduce a method that parameterizes the solution using
spectral bases on arbitrary spatiotemporal domains, whereby the basis is
defined on a hyperrectangle containing the true domain. We find the
coefficients of the basis expansion by solving an optimization problem whereby
both the equations, the boundary conditions and any optimization targets are
enforced by a loss function, building on a key idea from Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs). Since the representation of the function natively has
exponential convergence, so does the solution of the optimization problem, as
long as it can be solved efficiently. We find empirically that the optimization
protocols developed for machine learning find solutions with exponential
convergence on a wide range of equations. The method naturally allows for the
incorporation of data assimilation by including additional terms in the loss
function, and for the efficient solution of optimization problems over the PDE
solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and enhance SPIR capacity in graph-based replication environments where data security and efficiency are critical.

Method: Develop an algorithm to transform PIR schemes into SPIR schemes to establish capacity bounds on specific graph structures, such as path and cyclic graphs.

Result: Provided tighter SPIR capacity bounds than trivial PIR capacities for certain graph structures and identified the SPIR capacity as 0.5 for a path graph with three vertices.

Conclusion: The findings offer improved methods for SPIR with enhanced capacity bounds, contributing to privacy-oriented data retrieval in graph-replicated systems.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in
settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here,
each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers
if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of
database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness,
independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR
capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded
symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness.
Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into
the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on
graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic
graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the
trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of
path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be
$\frac{1}{2}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing multi-user chaotic communication systems lack scalability, suffer low spectral efficiency due to reference signals, and are constrained by rigid codebook designs in non-orthogonal schemes.

Method: A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator was developed to learn chaotic signal characteristics offline, eliminating chaotic synchronization, and integrates a dual-domain feature extraction architecture within a successive interference cancellation framework.

Result: The system outperforms traditional MU-DCSK and other DL-aided schemes in spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, BER, security, and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-NOMA-CSK system is validated as a practical solution for secure and efficient vehicular communications.

Abstract: Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for
vehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered
considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.
However, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those
based on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to
reference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal
multiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code
multiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high
computational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook
designs. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain
non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for
vehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is
designed to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline
training, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference
signal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction
architecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain
information of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic
channels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and
extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit
error rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower
computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided
schemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular
communications.

*Zhenyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli,Zhi Ding*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Resi-VidTok, a framework for reliable video transmission, ensures quality and reliability even in poor wireless conditions using a novel tokenization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of real-time video transmission over wireless networks under severe conditions like limited bandwidth and weak connectivity.

Method: Resi-VidTok introduces a 1D tokenization pipeline with progressive encoding, stride-controlled frame sparsification, and channel-adaptive coding to ensure reliable video transmission.

Result: The framework achieves robust video quality at extremely low channel bandwidth ratios (as low as 0.0004) and supports real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps.

Conclusion: Resi-VidTok proves to be a practical solution for ultra-low-rate, energy-efficient, and reliable video transmission in adverse wireless conditions.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly
challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel
conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we
propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for
ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong
robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity
digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete,
importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens,
Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and
graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is
a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential
temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete
token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal
extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame
sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces
transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a
channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically
allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel
condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results
indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios
(CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps,
demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient,
latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

*Yixiang Zhou,Tong Wu,Meixia Tao,Jianhua Mo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fed-PELAD, a federated learning framework for improving CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems, addressing communication overhead, data heterogeneity, and privacy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle issues in CSI feedback for massive MIMO systems such as high communication overhead, device-related data heterogeneity, and ensuring privacy.

Method: Fed-PELAD uses personalized encoders trained on user-specific data and a shared decoder adapted using LoRA to reduce communication costs. It incorporates an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated learning-rate ratios.

Result: Fed-PELAD reduces uplink communication cost by 42.97% and improves CSI feedback accuracy by 1.2 dB under heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates efficient communication and improved performance for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems by leveraging a federated learning design with personalization and adaptation mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenges of communication overhead, data
heterogeneity, and privacy in deep learning for channel state information (CSI)
feedback in massive MIMO systems. To this end, we propose Fed-PELAD, a novel
federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a
LoRA-adapted shared decoder. Specifically, personalized encoders are trained
locally on each user equipment (UE) to capture device-specific channel
characteristics, while a shared decoder is updated globally via the
coordination of the base station (BS) by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This
design ensures that only compact LoRA adapter parameters instead of full model
updates are transmitted for aggregation. To further enhance convergence
stability, we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated
learning-rate ratio during LoRA aggregation. Extensive simulations on
3GPP-standard channel models demonstrate that Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97\%
of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while
achieving a performance gain of 1.2 dB in CSI feedback accuracy under
heterogeneous conditions.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-latency transformer implementation for FPGAs, enabling real-time applications in high-energy physics with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are highly effective in machine learning tasks like jet tagging at the CERN LHC, but their high computational complexity hinders their use in real-time scenarios such as hardware trigger systems.

Method: The authors optimize transformers for FPGAs using high-granularity quantization and distributed arithmetic, achieving nanosecond-level latencies. They enhanced the hls4ml library with multi-head and linear attention for accessibility.

Result: A transformer model fit onto a single FPGA achieved nanosecond latency and superior jet tagging performance, surpassing baseline models.

Conclusion: This work enables the use of transformers in real-time high-energy physics applications and advances the capabilities of LHC trigger systems.

Abstract: We present the first sub-microsecond transformer implementation on an FPGA
achieving competitive performance for state-of-the-art high-energy physics
benchmarks. Transformers have shown exceptional performance on multiple tasks
in modern machine learning applications, including jet tagging at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, their computational complexity prohibits
use in real-time applications, such as the hardware trigger system of the
collider experiments up until now. In this work, we demonstrate the first
application of transformers for jet tagging on FPGAs, achieving
$\mathcal{O}(100)$ nanosecond latency with superior performance compared to
alternative baseline models. We leverage high-granularity quantization and
distributed arithmetic optimization to fit the entire transformer model on a
single FPGA, achieving the required throughput and latency. Furthermore, we add
multi-head attention and linear attention support to hls4ml, making our work
accessible to the broader fast machine learning community. This work advances
the next-generation trigger systems for the High Luminosity LHC, enabling the
use of transformers for real-time applications in high-energy physics and
beyond.

*Ferdinand Genans,Antoine Godichon-Baggioni,François-Xavier Vialard,Olivier Wintenberger*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in approximating the Optimal Transport map in a semi-discrete setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical guarantees of using SGD-based solvers for Optimal Transport map approximation in a semi-discrete setting has been an open problem, despite its strong empirical performance.

Method: The paper introduces an averaged projected SGD algorithm and analyzes its convergence and estimation performance under specific conditions and assumptions on the source measure.

Result: The study demonstrates that the SGD algorithm achieves a minimax convergence rate of O(1/√n), where n is the sample size from the source measure.

Conclusion: SGD-based methods are effective in approximating the OT map even under minimal assumptions on the source measure, with theoretical convergence guarantees. Numerical results back up the theoretical findings.

Abstract: We investigate the semi-discrete Optimal Transport (OT) problem, where a
continuous source measure $\mu$ is transported to a discrete target measure
$\nu$, with particular attention to the OT map approximation. In this setting,
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based solvers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance in recent machine learning applications, yet their
theoretical guarantee to approximate the OT map is an open question. In this
work, we answer it positively by providing both computational and statistical
convergence guarantees of SGD. Specifically, we show that SGD methods can
estimate the OT map with a minimax convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples drawn from $\mu$.
To establish this result, we study the averaged projected SGD algorithm, and
identify a suitable projection set that contains a minimizer of the objective,
even when the source measure is not compactly supported. Our analysis holds
under mild assumptions on the source measure and applies to MTW cost
functions,whic include $\|\cdot\|^p$ for $p \in (1, \infty)$. We finally
provide numerical evidence for our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the less explored area of high-probability risk in estimating discrete distributions under $chi^2$-divergence loss.

Method: Provide sharp bounds for the classical Laplace estimator, characterize minimax high-probability risk, and introduce smoothing strategies for optimality.

Result: Demonstrated the Laplace estimator's optimality and characterized minimax risk achievable through specific strategies.

Conclusion: Highlighted the distinction between asymptotic and non-asymptotic guarantees, emphasizing unavoidable overhead in non-asymptotic cases, improving theoretical divergence-based estimation understanding.

Abstract: We investigate the high-probability estimation of discrete distributions from
an \iid sample under $\chi^2$-divergence loss. Although the minimax risk in
expectation is well understood, its high-probability counterpart remains
largely unexplored. We provide sharp upper and lower bounds for the classical
Laplace estimator, showing that it achieves optimal performance among
estimators that do not rely on the confidence level. We further characterize
the minimax high-probability risk for any estimator and demonstrate that it can
be attained through a simple smoothing strategy. Our analysis highlights an
intrinsic separation between asymptotic and non-asymptotic guarantees, with the
latter suffering from an unavoidable overhead. This work sharpens existing
guarantees and advances the theoretical understanding of divergence-based
estimation.

### [342] [GReF: A Unified Generative Framework for Efficient Reranking via Ordered Multi-token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25220)
*Zhijie Lin,Zhuofeng Li,Chenglei Dai,Wentian Bao,Shuai Lin,Enyun Yu,Haoxiang Zhang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address challenges in multi-stage recommendation system reranking, proposing the Gen-Reranker with novel techniques to optimize training and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize multi-stage recommendation systems by addressing inefficiencies in reranking caused by the separation of the generator-evaluator paradigm and slow autoregressive inference.

Method: The authors develop Gen-Reranker with dynamic autoregressive mechanisms, pre-train on item exposure order, and implement Rerank-DPO and Ordered Multi-Token Prediction (OMTP) for end-to-end training and efficient inference.

Result: GReF achieves superior reranking performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with latency comparable to non-autoregressive models, and demonstrates significant improvement in real-world recommendation quality on Kuaishou.

Conclusion: The proposed GReF effectively resolves key challenges in reranking systems and proves its real-world applicability, delivering enhanced recommendation quality and efficiency.

Abstract: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes TV-Rec, a model for sequential recommendation using time-variant convolutional filters, which enhance global interaction capture without relying on self-attention. It achieves superior performance while reducing computational load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of traditional convolutional filters in capturing global interactions crucial for sequential recommendations.

Method: TV-Rec employs time-variant graph filters inspired by graph signal processing, replacing fixed filters and self-attention to better model temporal variations and user behavior patterns.

Result: TV-Rec outperforms state-of-the-art models by 7.49% on average across six public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TV-Rec demonstrates enhanced expressive power and computation efficiency, proving its effectiveness in capturing complex user interaction patterns without using self-attention.

Abstract: Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a personality-aware multimodal framework combining eye-tracking data, Big Five personality traits, and contextual cues to predict perceived and felt emotions, achieving notable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve emotion recognition in dynamic, conversational settings by addressing the challenges of subjectivity and complexity in accurately predicting human emotions.

Method: The proposed framework integrates eye-tracking data, Big Five personality traits, and contextual stimulus cues. Neural models capturing temporal gaze dynamics were used and compared against SVM and baseline methods for emotion prediction.

Result: The model achieved significant improvements, particularly with stimulus cues for perceived emotions (macro F1 up to 0.77) and with personality traits for felt emotions (macro F1 up to 0.58).

Conclusion: The integration of physiological, personality, and contextual information provides a more comprehensive and personalized approach to emotion recognition, advancing multimodal affective computing for applications in emotion-aware systems.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotions is critical for adaptive
human-computer interaction, yet remains challenging in dynamic,
conversation-like settings. This work presents a personality-aware multimodal
framework that integrates eye-tracking sequences, Big Five personality traits,
and contextual stimulus cues to predict both perceived and felt emotions.
Seventy-three participants viewed speech-containing clips from the CREMA-D
dataset while providing eye-tracking signals, personality assessments, and
emotion ratings. Our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused
them with trait and stimulus information, yielding consistent gains over SVM
and literature baselines. Results show that (i) stimulus cues strongly enhance
perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while (ii) personality
traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1
up to 0.58). These findings highlight the benefit of combining physiological,
trait-level, and contextual information to address the inherent subjectivity of
emotion. By distinguishing between perceived and felt responses, our approach
advances multimodal affective computing and points toward more personalized and
ecologically valid emotion-aware systems.

Motivation: To address the underserved access to digital healthcare among the Bengali-speaking population, and bridge the language and technology gaps in existing health platforms which mainly cater to European demographics.

Method: AmarDoctor employs a dual-interface system for patients and clinicians, integrating an adaptive questioning algorithm, voice-interactive AI, and AI-powered decision-making tools. It supports user engagement via multilingual capabilities and evaluates clinical accuracy through gold-standard case vignettes.

Result: AmarDoctor demonstrated a diagnostic precision of 81.08% compared to an average of 50.27% among physicians, and a specialty recommendation precision of 91.35% against physicians' 62.6%, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AmarDoctor effectively enhances primary care access for Bengali speakers by leveraging AI to provide high accuracy in diagnosis and personalized healthcare support, addressing gaps in global digital health solutions.

Abstract: This study presents AmarDoctor, a multilingual voice-interactive digital
health app designed to provide comprehensive patient triage and AI-driven
clinical decision support for Bengali speakers, a population largely
underserved in access to digital healthcare. AmarDoctor adopts a data-driven
approach to strengthen primary care delivery and enable personalized health
management. While platforms such as AdaHealth, WebMD, Symptomate, and K-Health
have become popular in recent years, they mainly serve European demographics
and languages. AmarDoctor addresses this gap with a dual-interface system for
both patients and healthcare providers, supporting three major Bengali
dialects. At its core, the patient module uses an adaptive questioning
algorithm to assess symptoms and guide users toward the appropriate specialist.
To overcome digital literacy barriers, it integrates a voice-interactive AI
assistant that navigates users through the app services. Complementing this,
the clinician-facing interface incorporates AI-powered decision support that
enhances workflow efficiency by generating structured provisional diagnoses and
treatment recommendations. These outputs inform key services such as
e-prescriptions, video consultations, and medical record management. To
validate clinical accuracy, the system was evaluated against a gold-standard
set of 185 clinical vignettes developed by experienced physicians.
Effectiveness was further assessed by comparing AmarDoctor performance with
five independent physicians using the same vignette set. Results showed
AmarDoctor achieved a top-1 diagnostic precision of 81.08 percent (versus
physicians average of 50.27 percent) and a top specialty recommendation
precision of 91.35 percent (versus physicians average of 62.6 percent).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework, Contextual and Cultural Intelligence (CCI), for deploying equitable and culturally aware AI in African markets through a production AI-native shopping platform, validated by user engagement data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for AI systems designed for African markets that prioritize cultural and practical relevance over traditional optimization goals such as computational scale and model performance.

Method: The study employs design science methodology, building and validating the CCI framework through a WhatsApp-based shopping platform and analyzing empirical data from user usage.

Result: Key findings include strong user preference (89%) for AI interaction via WhatsApp over conventional web interfaces, a high volume of culturally contextualized commerce activity, and effective use of culturally-informed prompt engineering.

Conclusion: The CCI framework offers a replicable approach for designing AI that integrates infrastructure intelligence, cultural intelligence, and commercial intelligence. This challenges traditional Silicon Valley AI architectures while advancing equitable AI solutions in resource-constrained regions.

Abstract: While global AI development prioritizes model performance and computational
scale, meaningful deployment in African markets requires fundamentally
different architectural decisions. This paper introduces Contextual and
Cultural Intelligence (CCI) -- a systematic framework enabling AI systems to
process cultural meaning, not just data patterns, through locally relevant,
emotionally intelligent, and economically inclusive design. Using design
science methodology, we validate CCI through a production AI-native
cross-border shopping platform serving diaspora communities. Key empirical
findings: 89% of users prefer WhatsApp-based AI interaction over traditional
web interfaces (n=602, chi-square=365.8, p<0.001), achieving 536 WhatsApp users
and 3,938 total conversations across 602 unique users in just 6 weeks, and
culturally informed prompt engineering demonstrates sophisticated understanding
of culturally contextualized queries, with 89% family-focused commerce patterns
and natural code-switching acceptance. The CCI framework operationalizes three
technical pillars: Infrastructure Intelligence (mobile-first, resilient
architectures), Cultural Intelligence (multilingual NLP with social context
awareness), and Commercial Intelligence (trust-based conversational commerce).
This work contributes both theoretical innovation and reproducible
implementation patterns, challenging Silicon Valley design orthodoxies while
providing actionable frameworks for equitable AI deployment across

TL;DR: This study finds that narrow AI tools like ChatGPT improve efficiency in task performance but do not enhance underlying cognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI tools like ChatGPT enhance core cognitive abilities or merely optimize task performance.

Method: Thirty young adults participated in a 7-week protocol involving neuropsychological assessments and a 4-week AI-supported (or non-AI) intervention for problem-solving and verbal comprehension tasks.

Result: AI-assisted participants were faster and more accurate, but no measurable changes in cognitive abilities (problem-solving or verbal comprehension) were detected.

Conclusion: Current narrow AI tools act as cognitive scaffolds to extend task efficiency but do not transform mental capacities, emphasizing the need for promoting critical thinking in AI-augmented environments.

Abstract: The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human cognition
raises a fundamental question: does AI merely improve efficiency, or does it
alter how we think? This study experimentally tested whether short-term
exposure to narrow AI tools enhances core cognitive abilities or simply
optimizes task performance. Thirty young adults completed standardized
neuropsychological assessments embedded in a seven-week protocol with a
four-week online intervention involving problem-solving and verbal
comprehension tasks, either with or without AI support (ChatGPT). While
AI-assisted participants completed several tasks faster and more accurately, no
significant pre-post differences emerged in standardized measures of problem
solving or verbal comprehension. These results demonstrate efficiency gains
without cognitive change, suggesting that current narrow AI systems serve as
cognitive scaffolds extending performance without transforming underlying
mental capacities. The findings highlight the need for ethical and educational
frameworks that promote critical and autonomous thinking in an increasingly
AI-augmented cognitive ecology.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper identifies user misconceptions about conversational LLM-based programming assistants, such as assumptions about capabilities like web access or code execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users may have misplaced expectations about the capabilities of large language model (LLM)-based tools in programming contexts, resulting in inefficient use and over-reliance.

Method: The research used a two-phase approach: brainstorming/cataloging potential user misconceptions and analyzing Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based chatbot from an open dataset.

Result: Findings include evidence of misconceptions around LLM capabilities, such as web access and deeper conceptual issues in debugging and optimization processes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of designing LLM-based programming tools that transparently communicate their limitations and capabilities to users.

Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have become
widely available, with conversational assistants like ChatGPT proving
particularly accessible to less experienced programmers. However, the varied
capabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of
extensions that enable web search, code execution, or retrieval-augmented
generation create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can
and cannot do. Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive
practices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here,
we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based
assistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we
first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then
conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues
surface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based
chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset. Indeed, we see evidence that
some users have misplaced expectations about the availability of LLM-based
chatbot features like web access, code execution, or non-text output
generation. We also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around
the scope of information required to debug, validate, and optimize programs.
Our findings reinforce the need for designing LLM-based tools that more clearly
communicate their programming capabilities to users.

*Matthew Kelly*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Epistemic Suite, a diagnostic framework using twenty lenses to understand and evaluate AI-generated outputs with a focus on context, accountability, and epistemic clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) can create misleadingly coherent text, prompting the need for tools that surface the conditions underlying AI outputs and safeguard user understanding.

Method: The authors present the Epistemic Suite, a framework consisting of diagnostic lenses, an epistemic suspension mechanism, a triage protocol, and governance safeguards. These tools inspect and mediate AI outputs externally rather than modifying the model architecture.

Result: The Suite shifts AI systems into a diagnostic mode, producing artifacts such as flags and maps that enable human deliberation and informed judgment about AI outputs.

Conclusion: The Epistemic Suite provides an external scaffold that ensures epistemic clarity and accountability, distinguishing between AI's performance and understanding while embedding safeguards like refusal and modesty into AI deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent, plausible text that can mislead
users into mistaking simulated coherence for genuine understanding. This paper
introduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for
surfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and
received. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through
twenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to
reveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced
authority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:
diagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction
over foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural
requirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts
language models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable
artifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS
bundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.
A key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit
breaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based
on judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage
Protocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link
activation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and
pluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into
model architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite
operates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as
safeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between
performance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while

*Maneesh Bilalpur,Megan Hamm,Young Ji Lee,Natasha Norman,Kathleen M. McTigue,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze and summarize African American (AA) narratives to uncover impactful insights for healthcare interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to uncover underlying factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes for African Americans by leveraging the communicative power of storytelling through modern AI tools.

Method: The study utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify topics in 50 transcribed African American narratives followed by hierarchical summarization with an open-source LLM. Topic summaries were validated for accuracy and usefulness using GPT4 ratings and expert assessments.

Result: The analysis identified 26 relevant topics including health behaviors, interactions with medical teams, and caregiving. GPT4 ratings confirmed the fabricated-free and useful nature of the summaries, and their reliability was moderately to highly aligned with expert evaluations.

Conclusion: AI tools like LLMs and LDA offer valuable insights into marginalized community experiences, enabling researchers to identify potential healthcare improvements and design impactful interventions based on narrative data.

Abstract: Storytelling is a powerful form of communication and may provide insights
into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes. To determine whether
Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and
avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization
of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed
stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience
using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given
topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization
approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries
for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were
rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4
model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story
summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA
stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from
fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT
ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our
approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors,
interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management,
among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors
and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient
manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and
LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a
variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical
improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving
health outcomes.

*HaoYang Shang,Xuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of "mutual wanting" to analyze the dynamics of bidirectional desires between humans and AI during model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how humans and AI mutually create expectations during model transitions, aiming to guide better AI design and improve user trust.

Method: Analyzed user comments on major AI forums and conducted controlled experiments with OpenAI models. Used advanced NLP methods like dual-algorithm topic modeling and multi-dimensional feature extraction.

Result: Revealed nearly half of users use anthropomorphic language, noted trust exceeding betrayal language, and identified distinct user clusters based on expectation patterns. Developed a measurable framework for aligning AI systems with user needs.

Conclusion: Mutual wanting is a tangible and quantifiable phenomenon that can guide the development of trustworthy and relationally-aware AI systems to bridge expectation gaps effectively.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) creates complex
bidirectional expectations between users and AI systems that are poorly
understood. We introduce the concept of "mutual wanting" to analyze these
expectations during major model transitions. Through analysis of user comments
from major AI forums and controlled experiments across multiple OpenAI models,
we provide the first large-scale empirical validation of bidirectional desire
dynamics in human-AI interaction. Our findings reveal that nearly half of users
employ anthropomorphic language, trust significantly exceeds betrayal language,
and users cluster into distinct "mutual wanting" types. We identify measurable
expectation violation patterns and quantify the expectation-reality gap
following major model releases. Using advanced NLP techniques including
dual-algorithm topic modeling and multi-dimensional feature extraction, we
develop the Mutual Wanting Alignment Framework (M-WAF) with practical
applications for proactive user experience management and AI system design.
These findings establish mutual wanting as a measurable phenomenon with clear
implications for building more trustworthy and relationally-aware AI systems.

### [355] [The Narrative Continuity Test: A Conceptual Framework for Evaluating Identity Persistence in AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24831)
*Stefano Natangelo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Narrative Continuity Test (NCT), a framework to evaluate persistent identity and coherence in AI systems with large language models (LLMs), highlighting their inability to maintain context and identity across time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating AI systems for continuity and coherence over time, rather than solely focusing on task performance.

Method: Development of the Narrative Continuity Test (NCT), which assesses identity persistence across five axes: Situated Memory, Goal Persistence, Autonomous Self-Correction, Stylistic & Semantic Stability, and Persona/Role Continuity.

Result: Current AI architectures, as shown in case analyses, fail to support the five axes of continuity under stateless inference, revealing predictable failures.

Conclusion: The NCT provides a conceptual framework to shift AI evaluation focus from performance metrics to persistence metrics, emphasizing the need for architectural designs supporting long-term identity and goal coherence.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) can now
generate coherent text, music, and images, yet they operate without a
persistent state: each inference reconstructs context from scratch. This paper
introduces the Narrative Continuity Test (NCT) -- a conceptual framework for
evaluating identity persistence and diachronic coherence in AI systems. Unlike
capability benchmarks that assess task performance, the NCT examines whether an
LLM remains the same interlocutor across time and interaction gaps. The
framework defines five necessary axes -- Situated Memory, Goal Persistence,
Autonomous Self-Correction, Stylistic & Semantic Stability, and Persona/Role
Continuity -- and explains why current architectures systematically fail to
support them. Case analyses (Character.AI, Grok, Replit, Air Canada) show
predictable continuity failures under stateless inference. The NCT reframes AI
evaluation from performance to persistence, outlining conceptual requirements
for future benchmarks and architectural designs that could sustain long-term
identity and goal coherence in generative models.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces PANORAMA, a dataset for patent examination, providing complete decision trails to evaluate LLMs on tasks like prior art retrieval and assessing claim novelty and non-obviousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent examination requires nuanced human judgment on novelty and non-obviousness, which current NLP approaches often oversimplify.

Method: Constructed PANORAMA, a dataset consisting of 8,143 U.S. patent examination records segmented to simulate the evaluation process of patent professionals.

Result: Findings show LLMs are effective in prior art retrieval but struggle with assessing novelty and non-obviousness in patent claims.

Conclusion: Advancing NLP in the patent domain requires a better understanding of the patent examination process; PANORAMA supports this goal as a resource to benchmark and refine LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Patent examination remains an ongoing challenge in the NLP literature even
after the advent of large language models (LLMs), as it requires an extensive
yet nuanced human judgment on whether a submitted claim meets the statutory
standards of novelty and non-obviousness against previously granted claims --
prior art -- in expert domains. Previous NLP studies have approached this
challenge as a prediction task (e.g., forecasting grant outcomes) with
high-level proxies such as similarity metrics or classifiers trained on
historical labels. However, this approach often overlooks the step-by-step
evaluations that examiners must make with profound information, including
rationales for the decisions provided in office actions documents, which also
makes it harder to measure the current state of techniques in patent review
processes. To fill this gap, we construct PANORAMA, a dataset of 8,143 U.S.
patent examination records that preserves the full decision trails, including
original applications, all cited references, Non-Final Rejections, and Notices
of Allowance. Also, PANORAMA decomposes the trails into sequential benchmarks
that emulate patent professionals' patent review processes and allow
researchers to examine large language models' capabilities at each step of
them. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs are relatively effective at
retrieving relevant prior art and pinpointing the pertinent paragraphs, they
struggle to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of patent claims. We discuss
these results and argue that advancing NLP, including LLMs, in the patent
domain requires a deeper understanding of real-world patent examination. Our
dataset is openly available at

*Shaoshan Liu,Anina Schwarzenbach,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper highlights the importance of resilience—psychological, social, and organizational—in mitigating AI's disruptive impact on individuals, trust, and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unsettling implications of AI on work, identity, and social trust by focusing on human resilience as a countermeasure.

Method: The authors synthesize evidence showing how resilience buffers strain, reduces burnout, and prevents silent failures in AI-mediated workflows, while demonstrating how resilience can be cultivated via training programs that complement structural safeguards.

Result: Resilience capacities like emotion regulation, social support, and responsive governance reduce individual and organizational failures associated with AI disruptions.

Conclusion: By advocating actionable human resilience, the paper provides a practical framework for responsible AI adoption, preserving human agency, and guiding policymakers, educators, and operators.

Abstract: AI is displacing tasks, mediating high-stakes decisions, and flooding
communication with synthetic content, unsettling work, identity, and social
trust. We argue that the decisive human countermeasure is resilience. We define
resilience across three layers: psychological, including emotion regulation,
meaning-making, cognitive flexibility; social, including trust, social capital,
coordinated response; organizational, including psychological safety, feedback
mechanisms, and graceful degradation. We synthesize early evidence that these
capacities buffer individual strain, reduce burnout through social support, and
lower silent failure in AI-mediated workflows through team norms and
risk-responsive governance. We also show that resilience can be cultivated
through training that complements rather than substitutes for structural
safeguards. By reframing the AI debate around actionable human resilience, this
article offers policymakers, educators, and operators a practical lens to
preserve human agency and steer responsible adoption.

*Richard Csaky*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The thesis explores the modeling and decoding of non-invasive brain signals like EEG and MEG, focusing on visual stimuli perception and inner speech decoding through deep learning and novel forecasting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain activity during visual stimuli perception and inner speech while improving decoding methods using electrophysiological signals.

Method: The research employs deep learning techniques for brain decoding, including linear models for individual decoding, group-decoding solutions for variability challenges, and Transformer-based forecasting models.

Result: Transformer-based models showed high accuracy in generating realistic brain signals, while decoding inner speech proved challenging with mostly negative results.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods improve modeling and decoding of brain signals, but inner speech decoding remains a complex problem requiring further research and innovative approaches.

Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain
signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate
what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert
speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The
thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.
A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in
electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or
between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset
variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep
learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli
using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep
learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods
to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel
forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based
architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's
electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset
containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped
magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner
speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and
sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be
mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

TL;DR: PulseFi is a cost-effective system using Wi-Fi sensing and AI to non-intrusively monitor heart and breathing rates, detecting apnea events with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-intrusive, affordable monitoring of vital signs like heart rate and breathing rate is essential in expanding accessible healthcare solutions.

Method: The system processes Wi-Fi telemetry data (CSI) through a low-compute LSTM neural network. It uses low-cost devices like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi 4B for data collection and evaluation.

Result: PulseFi demonstrates accurate estimation of heart rate and breathing rate, outperforming expensive antenna systems in terms of accessibility and performance.

Conclusion: PulseFi offers an effective, seamless, and affordable solution for non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs, showing promising results for broader healthcare applications.

Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in
a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel
low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial
intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing
rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity
devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal
processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State
Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that
we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings
of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the
most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can
effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive
way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can
be expensive and less accessible.

*Dong-Hyeon Kang,Ju-Hyeon Nam,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents EcoScale-Net, a model to efficiently and accurately classify long-sequence ECGs, reducing computational costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ECG interpretation is error-prone, and existing CNN models lack generalization ability for long ECG sequences, necessitating an improved classification approach.

Method: EcoScale-Net introduces a hierarchical design, reducing redundancy from OS-CNN while retaining full receptive field coverage through downsampling and bottleneck convolutions.

Result: On the CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScale-Net reduced parameters by 90% and FLOPs by 99%, while increasing F1 score by 2.4% compared to OS-CNN.

Conclusion: EcoScale-Net improves ECG classification accuracy and reduces computational costs, making it suitable for real-time use on standard hardware.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and
existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that
generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)
addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach
conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes
computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient
Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that
retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each
stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after
down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni
Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large
scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by
99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These
results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence
ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time
deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub
Link.

TL;DR: The paper presents StrikeWatch, a wrist-worn device performing real-time gait analysis using compact deep learning models optimized for embedded FPGAs, for improving running posture and preventing injuries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical, non-intrusive, real-time gait recognition system for runners that eliminates the limitations of bulky and offline analysis systems.

Method: Four compact Deep Learning architectures (1D-CNN, 1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) were optimized for energy-efficient on-device inference on embedded FPGAs. A labeled dataset from outdoor running sessions was collected for evaluation.

Result: Among the models, 6-bit quantized 1D-SepCNN achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.847, consuming 0.350 {bc}J per inference with 0.140ms latency, enabling continuous usage for up to 13.6 days.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of wrist-worn wearables with efficient on-device DL models to provide actionable feedback to runners, promoting better gait patterns and injury prevention in a practical and sustainable way.

Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can
lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait
analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have
demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,
post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and
non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such
devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.
This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs
entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case
study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable
runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory
feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,
1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient
inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our
custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor
running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment
pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and
hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized
1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just
0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running
at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference
on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub

*Nader Nemati*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sinusoidal Time–Amplitude Resampling (STAR), a morphology-faithful augmentation method for ECG classification to address challenges of label imbalance, diverse conditions, and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving clinical ECG classification accuracy by addressing challenges like label imbalance, diverse recording conditions, and overlapping pathologies without distorting diagnostically critical morphology.

Method: The STAR method applies beat-wise augmentation between R-peaks in ECG signals through controlled time warping and amplitude scaling, preserving P–QRS–T morphology and enabling stable, device-independent training.

Result: STAR broadens training diversity, improves cross-source classification stability, facilitates rare class learning, and demonstrates practical utility with a transparent implementation using stratified protocols over diverse datasets.

Conclusion: STAR offers a trustworthy, simple, and versatile augmentation tool for clinical ECG classification while ensuring morphology precision and cross-device durability.

Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse
recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance
hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting
diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude
Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates
strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and
amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T
order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed
for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that
broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii)
source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and
cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with
common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on
rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling
informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global
crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that
suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a
transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware,
stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus,
thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a
simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where
trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are
essential.

*Jiaming Cheng,Wei Chen,Bo Ai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-driven end-to-end (E2E) transceiver architecture for next-generation wireless systems, removing pilots and cyclic prefix to increase spectral efficiency while adapting to dynamic channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional OFDM systems are limited by significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency due to reliance on pilots and cyclic prefix. Dynamic NextG environments require adaptive, intelligent communication solutions.

Method: The authors propose an AI-native E2E architecture featuring joint training for constellation shaping and a neural receiver, a lightweight channel adapter (CA) for rapid channel adaptation, scalable multi-modulation capability, and constrained optimization for managing peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

Result: The proposed system shows superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and adaptability in various channel conditions, verified through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses major challenges in traditional systems and is a strong candidate for enabling efficient, adaptive, and robust AI-native NextG wireless communication systems.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native
NextG.

*Ishfaq Aziz,Mohamad Alipour*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-based framework for estimating continuous subsurface dielectric properties using limited sensors and radar data, achieving high accuracy and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of subsurface dielectric properties is critical for environmental monitoring and infrastructure evaluation, and conventional methods face limitations in adjusting to continuous property variations and managing sparse data.

Method: The study utilized a physics-informed machine learning approach that learns subsurface permittivity as a continuous neural function of depth, adhering to both experimental data and Maxwell’s equations.

Result: Validation experiments and simulations showed high accuracy (R^2=0.93) and sensitivity (Delta eps_r=2) in estimating subsurface permittivity, requiring fewer sensors even in complex settings.

Conclusion: The presented framework shifts subsurface inversion from focusing on boundaries to continuous property estimation, enhancing the precision of electromagnetic imaging for realistic and cost-efficient applications.

Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few

reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

*John-Joseph Brady,Benjamin Cox,Víctor Elvira,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper discusses differentiable particle filters (DPFs) for state-space models, their implementation using PyTorch, and validation through experiments, enabling easier access and comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard particle filters used in time-series analysis are non-differentiable, preventing direct gradient-based optimization for system parameter estimation. There is a need for differentiable approaches to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors propose implementing differentiable particle filters (DPFs) within a unified API using PyTorch. This system reproduces existing experiments and provides a user-friendly framework for research.

Result: The framework successfully validates previous studies by replicating experiments, showcasing the applicability and versatility of DPFs for various challenges in state-space modeling.

Conclusion: The implementation broadens access to differentiable particle filters and simplifies comparisons, supporting advancements in time-series analysis and state-space modeling.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In
the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ
particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the
hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle
filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of
the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based
optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle
filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several
recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering
differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such
differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular
PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible
to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison
between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several
existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several
common challenges with state space modelling.

### [367] [How can methods for classifying and clustering trajectories be used for prevention trials? An example in Alzheimer's disease area](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24751)
*Céline Bougel,Sébastien Déjean,Caroline Giulioli,Philippe Saint-Pierre,Nicolas Savy,Sandrine Andrieu*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: Clinical trials often fail to detect subgroup effects due to population heterogeneity. This paper explores data-driven clustering methods to identify homogeneous subgroups based on cognitive trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the challenge of inconclusive clinical trials, where heterogeneity may obscure subgroup effects. The authors aimed to develop methods that classify trajectory patterns in cognitive decline.

Method: Data-driven methods like k-means for longitudinal data, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised dichotomous classification were applied to data from the MAPT trial.

Result: Using unsupervised k-means clustering, three subgroups were identified, one of which showed cognitive decline. Other methods faced limitations in direct longitudinal data analysis, requiring rate of change indicators.

Conclusion: Alternative unsupervised stratification approaches highlight hidden subgroup patterns in trajectories, offering a complementary perspective for analyzing clinical trial outcomes.

Abstract: Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an
intervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis
testing. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population.
Indeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot
detect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm
to a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another
perspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of
subjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention
trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of
prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which
requires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account.
The primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different
methods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain
Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial
with four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite
Z-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic
mixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is
therefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory
classification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal
data, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised
analysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status.
Results: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and
one of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up.
This method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite
Z-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised
methods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore
necessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the
rate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation
was performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the
graphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define
responder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria.
Discussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be
inconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have
masked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta
Amyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to
subject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify
patterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the
potential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the
final endpoint considered.

*Rodrigo Carmo Terin*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a Minkowskian physics-informed neural network (M--PINN) to solve Dyson--Schwinger equations in Minkowski spacetime, integrating a dispersive solver and neural network-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and computationally-efficient solutions to Dyson--Schwinger equations in Minkowski spacetime for quantum electrodynamics motivated this study.

Method: The method combines a dispersive solver with a physics-informed neural network trained on regularization and smoothing penalties under specific configurations in Minkowski spacetime.

Result: The M--PINN reproduces dispersive solutions while being computationally efficient and maintaining differentiability, achieving agreement across IR and UV scales.

Conclusion: M--PINN represents a robust method for solving Dyson--Schwinger equations in Minkowski spacetime and offers potential for extensions with more realistic models and uncertainty analysis.

Abstract: A Minkowskian physics-informed neural network approach (M--PINN) is
formulated to solve the Dyson--Schwinger integral equations (DSE) of quantum
electrodynamics (QED) directly in Minkowski spacetime. Our novel strategy
merges two complementary approaches: (i) a dispersive solver based on Lehmann
representations and subtracted dispersion relations, and (ii) a M--PINN that
learns the fermion mass function $B(p^2)$, under the same truncation and
renormalization configuration (quenched, rainbow, Landau gauge) with the loss
integrating the DSE residual with multi--scale regularization, and
monotonicity/smoothing penalties in the spacelike branch in the same way as in
our previous work in Euclidean space. The benchmarks show quantitative
agreement from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV) scales in both
on-shell and momentum-subtraction schemes. In this controlled setting, our
M--PINN reproduces the dispersive solution whilst remaining computationally
compact and differentiable, paving the way for extensions with realistic
vertices, unquenching effects, and uncertainty-aware variants.

*Hao Chen,Jiaqi Wang,Yonggang Qi,Ke Li,Kaiyue Pang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4-Doodle, a framework for creating 3D sketch animations from text using pretrained image and video diffusion models. It addresses challenges of multi-view consistency, motion dynamics, and sparse sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of tools for animating stylized 3D vector sketches from textual descriptions, which are lightweight and suited for visual prototyping.

Method: The proposed method uses a training-free framework called 4-Doodle with dual-space distillation: one for multi-view-consistent geometry via Bèzier curves and another for temporally-aware motion dynamics.

Result: Experiments show that 4-Doodle generates realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations with higher fidelity and control compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 4-Doodle is a novel step towards simplifying and enhancing 4D content creation for intuitive sketch animation.

Abstract: We present a novel task: text-to-3D sketch animation, which aims to bring
freeform sketches to life in dynamic 3D space. Unlike prior works focused on
photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and
view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium
well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is
very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)
sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to
model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and
(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view
consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose
4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches
from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a
dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent
geometry using differentiable B\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion
dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),
which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization
ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse
sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that
separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,
enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated
movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally
realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing
baselines in both fidelity and controllability. We hope this work serves as a
step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation.

*Jingzhou Liu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes nonlinear dynamics in shallow neural networks with leaky ReLU activation, focusing on bifurcation of critical points as parameters vary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the leaky parameter α affects the behavior of critical points and symmetries in shallow neural networks.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework using equivariant gradient degree to analyze bifurcations and demonstrate results for shallow networks with Gaussian inputs.

Result: Found bifurcations are width-independent, occur only for α ≥ 0, and global minima remain stable without symmetry-breaking in the range α ∈ (0,1).

Conclusion: The study offers insights into the stability and critical behaviors of shallow neural networks under varying leaky parameters, validating findings with theoretical analysis and examples.

Abstract: In this work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of a shallow neural network
trained with mean-squared loss and leaky ReLU activation. Under Gaussian inputs
and equal layer width k, (1) we establish, based on the equivariant gradient
degree, a theoretical framework, applicable to any number of neurons k>= 4, to
detect bifurcation of critical points with associated symmetries from global
minimum as leaky parameter $\alpha$ varies. Typically, our analysis reveals
that a multi-mode degeneracy consistently occurs at the critical number 0,
independent of k. (2) As a by-product, we further show that such bifurcations
are width-independent, arise only for nonnegative $\alpha$ and that the global
minimum undergoes no further symmetry-breaking instability throughout the
engineering regime $\alpha$ in range (0,1). An explicit example with k=5 is
presented to illustrate the framework and exhibit the resulting bifurcation
together with their symmetries.

*Junhua Chen,Simon Mathis,Charles Harris,Kieran Didi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper applies Rectified Flows (ReFlow) to improve efficiency in generating diverse protein backbones, targeting reduction in function evaluations compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for protein backbone design are computationally burdensome due to the high number of function evaluations needed, making practical large-scale design inefficient.

Method: The authors adapt Rectified Flows (ReFlow) for the protein backbone domain, systematically evaluating design choices during both data preparation and inference.

Result: The study reveals sensitivity to coupling generation and annealing, finds that image-based ReFlow methods aren't directly applicable to proteins, and offers improvements specific to protein generation.

Conclusion: ReFlow methodology can be customized for protein backbone tasks, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Generative modeling techniques such as Diffusion and Flow Matching have
achieved significant successes in generating designable and diverse protein
backbones. However, many current models are computationally expensive,
requiring hundreds or even thousands of function evaluations (NFEs) to yield
samples of acceptable quality, which can become a bottleneck in practical
design campaigns that often generate $10^4\ -\ 10^6$ designs per target. In
image generation, Rectified Flows (ReFlow) can significantly reduce the
required NFEs for a given target quality, but their application in protein
backbone generation has been less studied. We apply ReFlow to improve the low
NFE performance of pretrained SE(3) flow matching models for protein backbone
generation and systematically study ReFlow design choices in the context of
protein generation in data curation, training and inference time settings. In
particular, we (1) show that ReFlow in the protein domain is particularly
sensitive to the choice of coupling generation and annealing, (2) demonstrate
how useful design choices for ReFlow in the image domain do not directly
translate to better performance on proteins, and (3) make improvements to
ReFlow methodology for proteins.

TL;DR: EnzyControl, supported by a new dataset (EnzyBind), enables substrate-specific enzyme backbone design and outperforms baseline models in structural and functional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical challenge of computational protein engineering: designing enzyme backbones with substrate-specific functionality, overcoming limitations in binding data, control, and flexibility.

Method: The method introduces EnzyControl, leveraging the EnzyBind dataset, with MSA-annotated catalytic sites and substrates, employing EnzyAdapter and a two-stage training paradigm.

Result: EnzyControl generates enzyme backbones with superior structural and functional metrics, achieving 13% improvements in designability and catalytic efficiency over baselines.

Conclusion: EnzyControl establishes a novel approach to enzyme design, showing significant improvements in functionality and scalability for computational enzyme backbone design.

Abstract: Designing enzyme backbones with substrate-specific functionality is a
critical challenge in computational protein engineering. Current generative
models excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data,
substrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone
generation. To address this, we introduce EnzyBind, a dataset with 11,100
experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from
PDBbind. Building on this, we propose EnzyControl, a method that enables
functional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our
approach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic
sites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted
from curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is EnzyAdapter,
a lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding
model, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm
further refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme
structures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance
across structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks,
with particularly notable improvements of 13\% in designability and 13\% in
catalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models. The code is released at

### [373] [Timing Games in Responsive Consensus Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25144)
*Kaya Alpturer,Kushal Babel,Aditya Saraf*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper studies timing games in responsive consensus protocols in blockchain systems and proposes dynamic block rewards to incentivize faster block proposals, addressing the issues of validators delaying proposals for selfish gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consensus protocols in blockchain seek to optimize network speed (latency and throughput), but validators are incentivized to delay proposals for higher rewards, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors modeled timing games of validators in responsive consensus protocols, found a prisoner's dilemma structure, and designed dynamic block rewards decreasing with round time. They incorporated a voting mechanism for validators to measure delays and align incentives towards timely proposals.

Result: Dynamic block rewards and the voting mechanism encouraged validators to prioritize faster block proposals. Simulations showed improved response times with minimal impact on validator connectivity disparities.

Conclusion: Responsive consensus protocols can incorporate economic incentives (dynamic rewards) for faster proposals, overcoming timing game inefficiencies, and enhancing blockchain system performance.

Abstract: Optimistic responsiveness -- the ability of a consensus protocol to operate
at the speed of the network -- is widely used in consensus protocol design to
optimize latency and throughput. However, blockchain applications incentivize
validators to play timing games by strategically delaying their proposals,
since increased block time correlates with greater rewards. Consequently, it
may appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible
in blockchain protocols. In this work, we develop a model of timing games in
responsive consensus protocols and find a prisoner's dilemma structure, where
cooperation (proposing promptly) is in the validators' best interest, but
individual incentives encourage validators to delay proposals selfishly. To
attain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease
with round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured
through a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's
round time. By carefully setting the protocol parameters, the voting mechanism
allows validators to coordinate and reach the cooperative equilibrium,
benefiting all through a higher rate-of-reward. Thus, instead of responsiveness
being an unattainable property due to timing games, we show that responsiveness
itself can promote faster block proposals. One consequence of moving from a
static to dynamic block reward is that validator utilities become more
sensitive to latency, worsening the gap between the best- and worst-connected
validators. Our analysis shows, however, that this effect is minor in both
theoretical latency models and simulations based on real-world networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of fair payoff division in scenarios involving indivisible resources such as parliamentary seats or key features in machine learning models.

Method: The study introduces the indivisible Shapley value concept, providing its formal definition and exploring associated properties.

Result: The authors validate their technique through three case studies, including an application to pinpoint key image regions in a classification task.

Conclusion: The approach offers a structured, fair method to allocate indivisible objects, with demonstrated applicability in real-world contexts.

Abstract: We consider the problem of payoff division in indivisible coalitional games,
where the value of the grand coalition is a natural number. This number
represents a certain quantity of indivisible objects, such as parliamentary
seats, kidney exchanges, or top features contributing to the outcome of a
machine learning model. The goal of this paper is to propose a fair method for
dividing these objects among players. To achieve this, we define the
indivisible Shapley value and study its properties. We demonstrate our proposed
technique using three case studies, in particular, we use it to identify key
regions of an image in the context of an image classification task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs) using a modified Monopoly Deal as a benchmark, emphasizing sequential decision-making. It shows Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) works on this structure and offers tools for reproducible research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study a less-explored sequential decision-making structure under uncertainty: bounded one-sided response games, which are strategically rich and common in real-world analogs.

Method: A modified Monopoly Deal game is introduced to isolate and study bounded one-sided response dynamics. CFR is tested for strategy convergence, supported by a research platform offering a unified environment, runtime, and human-playable interface.

Result: CFR successfully converges to effective decision-making strategies for the bounded one-sided response game dynamics without requiring new algorithms. A lightweight research platform is developed to facilitate experimentation.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effectiveness of CFR in bounded one-sided response settings and provides tools that advance experimentation and policy learning for such games.

Abstract: Card games are widely used to study sequential decision-making under
uncertainty, with real-world analogues in negotiation, finance, and
cybersecurity. Typically, these games fall into three categories based on the
flow of control: strictly-sequential (where players alternate single actions),
deterministic-response (where some actions trigger a fixed outcome), and
unbounded reciprocal-response (where alternating counterplays are permitted). A
less-explored but strategically rich structure exists: the bounded one-sided
response. This dynamic occurs when a player's action briefly transfers control
to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more
sequential moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this
mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs).
  We introduce a modified version of Monopoly Deal as a benchmark environment
that specifically isolates the BORG dynamic, where a Rent action forces the
opponent to sequentially choose payment assets. We demonstrate that the
gold-standard algorithm, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), successfully
converges on effective strategies for this domain without requiring novel
algorithmic extensions. To support efficient, reproducible experimentation, we
present a lightweight, full-stack research platform that unifies the
environment, a parallelized CFR runtime, and a human-playable web interface,
all runnable on a single workstation. This system provides a practical
foundation for exploring state representation and policy learning in bounded
one-sided response settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve online bidding methods by incorporating stochastic information, addressing gaps in prior deterministic approaches without stochastic predictions.

Method: The authors study distributional predictions and stochastic properties, analyzing deterministic and randomized algorithms while exploring Pareto-optimal consistency/robustness tradeoffs.

Result: They identify optimal algorithms that balance consistency and robustness, and present theoretical bounds on tradeoffs for randomized bidding.

Conclusion: Learning-augmented approaches leveraging stochastic predictions enhance online bidding, achieving optimal tradeoffs and addressing limitations of previous deterministic models.

Abstract: Online bidding is a classic optimization problem, with several applications
in online decision-making, the design of interruptible systems, and the
analysis of approximation algorithms. In this work, we study online bidding
under learning-augmented settings that incorporate stochasticity, in either the
prediction oracle or the algorithm itself. In the first part, we study bidding
under distributional predictions, and find Pareto-optimal algorithms that offer
the best-possible tradeoff between the consistency and the robustness of the
algorithm. In the second part, we study the power and limitations of randomized
bidding algorithms, by presenting upper and lower bounds on the
consistency/robustness tradeoffs. Previous works focused predominantly on
oracles that do not leverage stochastic information on the quality of the
prediction, and deterministic algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper compares Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) for uncertainty-aware nonlinear regression, highlighting their respective strengths through theoretical and empirical analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to better understand and compare two major probabilistic neural modeling approaches (BNNs and MDNs) in terms of their capability to model uncertainty in nonlinear regression settings.

Method: The study uses a unified theoretical and empirical framework. Theoretically, they analyze convergence rates, error bounds, and approximation biases. Empirically, they evaluate the models on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge).

Result: The results show MDNs efficiently model multimodal data and adaptive uncertainty, while BNNs provide more interpretable epistemic uncertainty in data-sparse cases.

Conclusion: MDNs and BNNs have complementary strengths. MDNs are advantageous for capturing complex uncertainty, whereas BNNs are useful when interpretability and handling data sparsity are key.

Abstract: This paper investigates two prominent probabilistic neural modeling
paradigms: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and Mixture Density Networks (MDNs)
for uncertainty-aware nonlinear regression. While BNNs incorporate epistemic
uncertainty by placing prior distributions over network parameters, MDNs
directly model the conditional output distribution, thereby capturing
multimodal and heteroscedastic data-generating mechanisms. We present a unified
theoretical and empirical framework comparing these approaches. On the
theoretical side, we derive convergence rates and error bounds under H\"older
smoothness conditions, showing that MDNs achieve faster Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence convergence due to their likelihood-based nature, whereas BNNs
exhibit additional approximation bias induced by variational inference.
Empirically, we evaluate both architectures on synthetic nonlinear datasets and
a radiographic benchmark (RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge). Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that MDNs more effectively capture multimodal
responses and adaptive uncertainty, whereas BNNs provide more interpretable
epistemic uncertainty under limited data. Our findings clarify the
complementary strengths of posterior-based and likelihood-based probabilistic
learning, offering guidance for uncertainty-aware modeling in nonlinear
systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Bayesian adaptive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method called khaos for uncertainty quantification, with efficient implementation in R.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCE is underutilized in statistics and lacks full Bayesian formulations with accessible implementations, especially in R.

Method: A fully Bayesian adaptive PCE method with a novel proposal distribution for interaction selection and a modified g-prior tailored to PCE, implemented in R.

Result: Through simulations and real-world applications, Bayesian adaptive PCE shows competitive performance in surrogate modeling, global sensitivity analysis, and ordinal regression.

Conclusion: Bayesian adaptive PCE fills a gap in statistical literature and provides an effective tool for uncertainty quantification tasks with accessible implementation.

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) are widely used for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) tasks, particularly in the applied mathematics community.
However, PCE has received comparatively less attention in the statistics
literature, and fully Bayesian formulations remain rare, especially with
implementations in R. Motivated by the success of adaptive Bayesian machine
learning models such as BART, BASS, and BPPR, we develop a new fully Bayesian
adaptive PCE method with an efficient and accessible R implementation: khaos.
Our approach includes a novel proposal distribution that enables data-driven
interaction selection, and supports a modified g-prior tailored to PCE
structure. Through simulation studies and real-world UQ applications, we
demonstrate that Bayesian adaptive PCE provides competitive performance for
surrogate modeling, global sensitivity analysis, and ordinal regression tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabMGP, a martingale posterior approach built upon the TabPFN transformer model, delivering efficient and reliable uncertainty quantification for tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the effectiveness of Bayesian inference, its application often faces issues such as prior elicitation, likelihood misspecification, and computational complexity. The authors aim to provide an alternative solution for principled uncertainty quantification.

Method: The authors propose the martingale posterior (MGP) framework, which leverages forward data generation using predictive rules. They specifically introduce TabMGP, which is built on the TabPFN transformer model for tabular data generation.

Result: TabMGP is shown to produce credible sets with near-nominal coverage, outperforming existing MGP implementations and standard Bayesian methods in various cases.

Conclusion: TabMGP demonstrates the potential of integrating foundation models with martingale posteriors to overcome limitations in traditional Bayesian methods, particularly for tabular data inference.

Abstract: Bayesian inference provides principled uncertainty quantification but is
often limited by challenges of prior elicitation, likelihood misspecification,
and computational burden. The martingale posterior (MGP, Fong et al., 2023)
offers an alternative, replacing prior-likelihood elicitation with a predictive
rule - namely, a sequence of one-step-ahead predictive distributions - for
forward data generation. The utility of MGPs depends on the choice of
predictive rule, yet the literature has offered few compelling examples.
Foundation transformers are well-suited here, as their autoregressive
generation mirrors this forward simulation and their general-purpose design
enables rich predictive modeling. We introduce TabMGP, an MGP built on TabPFN,
a transformer foundation model that is currently state-of-the-art for tabular
data. TabMGP produces credible sets with near-nominal coverage and often
outperforms both existing MGP constructions and standard Bayes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces tuning-free step size schedules for gradient-based sampling algorithms, ensuring strong theoretical guarantees without step size tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and inefficiency of tuning step size schedules for gradient-based sampling algorithms motivated the authors to develop adaptive, tuning-free methods.

Method: The authors propose tuning-free adaptive step size schedules for various sampling algorithms. They derive these schedules based on time-discretizations of Wasserstein gradient flows.

Result: The methods achieve convergence rates comparable to optimally tuned versions of existing algorithms and perform well across diverse tasks in both smooth and nonsmooth settings.

Conclusion: The proposed tuning-free algorithms eliminate the need for step size tuning, offering performance on par with optimally tuned approaches, thus simplifying and improving stochastic optimization workflows.

Abstract: We introduce adaptive, tuning-free step size schedules for gradient-based
sampling algorithms obtained as time-discretizations of Wasserstein gradient
flows. The result is a suite of tuning-free sampling algorithms, including
tuning-free variants of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), stochastic
gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), Stein
variational gradient descent (SVGD), and variational gradient descent (VGD).
More widely, our approach yields tuning-free algorithms for solving a broad
class of stochastic optimization problems over the space of probability
measures. Under mild assumptions (e.g., geodesic convexity and locally bounded
stochastic gradients), we establish strong theoretical guarantees for our
approach. In particular, we recover the convergence rate of optimally tuned
versions of these algorithms up to logarithmic factors, in both nonsmooth and
smooth settings. We then benchmark the performance of our methods against
comparable existing approaches. Across a variety of tasks, our algorithms
achieve similar performance to the optimal performance of existing algorithms,
with no need to tune a step size parameter.

### [381] [Distributional Evaluation of Generative Models via Relative Density Ratio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25507)
*Yuliang Xu,Yun Wei,Li Ma*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a metric, relative density ratio (RDR), for evaluating generative models by characterizing distributional differences between real and generated samples. It is efficient, interpretable, numerically stable, and provides feature-level insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative model evaluation methods often lack clear interpretability and fail to identify specific regions or features where distributional differences exist.

Method: Introduce RDR to measure $phi$-divergence between two distributions, estimate it using convex optimization techniques, and provide theoretical guarantees for convergence rates.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of the RDR metric to effectively compare generative models and reveal detailed goodness-of-fit insights such as sample space overlap, coverage, and fidelity.

Conclusion: RDR is a robust, interpretable, and efficient evaluation metric for assessing generative models, with potential benefits for understanding feature-specific distributional differences and generator behavior.

Abstract: We propose a functional evaluation metric for generative models based on the
relative density ratio (RDR) designed to characterize distributional
differences between real and generated samples. We show that the RDR as a
functional summary of the goodness-of-fit for the generative model, possesses
several desirable theoretical properties. It preserves $\phi$-divergence
between two distributions, enables sample-level evaluation that facilitates
downstream investigations of feature-specific distributional differences, and
has a bounded range that affords clear interpretability and numerical
stability. Functional estimation of the RDR is achieved efficiently through
convex optimization on the variational form of $\phi$-divergence. We provide
theoretical convergence rate guarantees for general estimators based on
M-estimator theory, as well as the convergence rates of neural network-based
estimators when the true ratio is in the anisotropic Besov space. We
demonstrate the power of the proposed RDR-based evaluation through numerical
experiments on MNIST, CelebA64, and the American Gut project microbiome data.
We show that the estimated RDR not only allows for an effective comparison of
the overall performance of competing generative models, but it can also offer a
convenient means of revealing the nature of the underlying goodness-of-fit.
This enables one to assess support overlap, coverage, and fidelity while
pinpointing regions of the sample space where generators concentrate and
revealing the features that drive the most salient distributional differences.

### [382] [Robust variable selection for spatial point processes observed with noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25550)
*Dominik Sturm,Ivo F. Sbalzarini*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for noise-robust variable selection in spatial point-process models using sparsity-promoting estimation and stability selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate identification of spatial covariates affecting event localization in noisy, high-resolution spatial data acquired via remote sensing and automated image analysis.

Method: The study integrates stability selection with point-process subsampling and introduces a non-convex best-subset penalty to enhance sparse variable selection performance under noisy conditions.

Result: The method successfully recovers true covariates in various noise scenarios and demonstrates improved selection accuracy and stability through simulations and application to forestry data.

Conclusion: This innovative method enables robust and accurate variable selection for spatial point-process models, aiding in understanding spatial phenomena even in noisy data scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a method for variable selection in the intensity function of
spatial point processes that combines sparsity-promoting estimation with
noise-robust model selection. As high-resolution spatial data becomes
increasingly available through remote sensing and automated image analysis,
identifying spatial covariates that influence the localization of events is
crucial to understand the underlying mechanism. However, results from automated
acquisition techniques are often noisy, for example due to measurement
uncertainties or detection errors, which leads to spurious displacements and
missed events. We study the impact of such noise on sparse point-process
estimation across different models, including Poisson and Thomas processes. To
improve noise robustness, we propose to use stability selection based on
point-process subsampling and to incorporate a non-convex best-subset penalty
to enhance model-selection performance. In extensive simulations, we
demonstrate that such an approach reliably recovers true covariates under
diverse noise scenarios and improves both selection accuracy and stability. We
then apply the proposed method to a forestry data set, analyzing the
distribution of trees in relation to elevation and soil nutrients in a tropical
rain forest. This shows the practical utility of the method, which provides a
systematic framework for robust variable selection in spatial point-process
models under noise, without requiring additional knowledge of the process.

### [383] [Trust Dynamics in Strategic Coopetition: Computational Foundations for Requirements Engineering in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24909)
*Vik Pant,Eric Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper develops a model combining requirements engineering and computational trust approaches to analyze dynamic trust in coopetitive, multi-stakeholder interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches lack robust frameworks for analyzing trust dynamics in competitive yet cooperative environments, combining conceptual modeling and computational advancements.

Method: The study extends game-theoretic foundations and introduces trust as a two-layer system incorporating both immediate behavior-based trust and reputation tracking.

Result: Through extensive simulations and experimental tests, the model successfully reproduces real-world trust evolution, validating theoretical premises using a case study of the Renault-Nissan Alliance.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively bridges the gap between conceptual and computational approaches, providing a meaningful framework for analyzing evolving trust dynamics in complex relationships.

Abstract: Requirements engineering increasingly occurs in multi-stakeholder
environments where organizations simultaneously cooperate and compete, creating
coopetitive relationships in which trust evolves dynamically based on observed
behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like
i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational
mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence.
Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide
algorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts
and conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a
computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic
coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer
system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation
tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where
cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating
hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We
develop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to
instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and
organizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125
parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias,
hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation
using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60
validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution
across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.
This technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in
arXiv:2510.18802.

### [384] [From Narrative to Action: A Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework for Human Mobility Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24802)
*Qiumeng Li,Chunhou Ji,Xinyue Liu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study introduces a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework to replicate human mobility behavior through a combination of high-level reasoning, planning, and execution, capturing semantic coherence and causal logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mobility models fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal reasoning of human travel decisions. A framework integrating these cognitive aspects is needed.

Method: The framework consists of three layers of cognition: macro-level narrative generation, mid-level structural planning, and micro-level execution within environmental simulations.

Result: This framework produces synthetic mobility trajectories that align with real-world behaviors while offering interpretable representations of human decision-making logic.

Conclusion: The Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework marks a shift from data-driven to cognition-driven mobility simulation, enabling high fidelity and scalable predictions of urban mobility behavior.

Abstract: Understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only
spatial-temporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy
underlying real-world travel decisions. Traditional agent-based or deep
learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to
capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large
language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative
reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical
LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level
narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral
execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent
is employed as a "creative writer" to produce diary-style narratives rich in
motivation and context, then uses another agent as a "structural parser" to
convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module
further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive
behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility
Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility
across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent
executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time
intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding
this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic
trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable
representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic
mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven
simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and
synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.

*Milad Yazdani,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Zirui Zhou,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASPRM, a model that improves inference-time performance in Multi-Agent Systems using guided search strategies and efficient computation allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong test-time performance and efficient computation are critical for deploying Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) effectively.

Method: The authors developed the MASPRM model, which estimates per-agent, per-action values from MCTS rollouts without human step-level annotations, and uses these values to guide inference-time beam search and tree pruning.

Result: MASPRM improves exact match scores on benchmarks GSM8K and MATH significantly (+30.7 and +22.9 points, respectively), with additional gains in zero-shot transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: MASPRM is a versatile model that enhances compute-aware reasoning in MAS, complementing other decoding strategies, and provides improved reliability and performance.

Abstract: Practical deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) demands strong test-time
performance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and
selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System
Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to
partial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller.
MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts
without requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local
targets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing
computation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH,
MASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final
answer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by
$+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers
zero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same
budget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and
complements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware
multi-agent reasoning. Code: https://github.com/milad1378yz/MASPRM

*Beiwen Zhang,Yongheng Liang,Hejun Wu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multil-party Ad Hoc Teamwork (MAHT) and proposes the MARs method for enhanced coordination among mutually unfamiliar groups of agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches require shared conventions and fixed teams, limiting adaptability in dynamic teamwork scenarios.

Method: The authors propose MARs, leveraging sparse skeleton graphs and relational modeling to better understand cross-group agent dynamics in ad hoc teamwork scenarios.

Result: MARs performed better than MARL and AHT baselines in both MPE and StarCraft II experiments, demonstrating faster convergence.

Conclusion: MARs enables effective coordination in multi-party ad hoc teamwork, expanding the applicability of reinforcement learning in diverse team-based environments.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARl) has achieved strong results in
cooperative tasks but typically assumes fixed, fully controlled teams. Ad hoc
teamwork (AHT) relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners,
yet existing variants still presume shared conventions. We introduce
Multil-party Ad Hoc Teamwork (MAHT), where controlled agents must coordinate
with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates. To address
this, we propose MARs, which builds a sparse skeleton graph and applies
relational modeling to capture cross-group dvnamics. Experiments on MPE and
starCralt ll show that MARs outperforms MARL and AHT baselines while converging
faster.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Med-Hammer, a novel attack combining Rowhammer hardware fault injection and neural Trojan attacks to compromise Vision Transformers (ViTs) in medical imaging, achieving high attack success rates while remaining stealthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in medical imaging analysis to hardware-level attacks, highlighting the risks to diagnostic accuracy and system integrity.

Method: The proposed Med-Hammer uses Rowhammer-induced bit flips to activate neural Trojans in ViTs, enabling targeted misclassification or suppression in medical imaging systems. Experiments were conducted on datasets like ISIC, Brain Tumor, and MedMNIST.

Result: Med-Hammer demonstrated high attack success rates, achieving 82.51% on MobileViT and 92.56% on SwinTransformer, while remaining stealthy.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical security risk integrating hardware-level faults and AI performance in healthcare, emphasizing an urgent need for robust defenses at the architectural and hardware levels.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful architectures in medical
image analysis, excelling in tasks such as disease detection, segmentation, and
classification. However, their reliance on large, attention-driven models makes
them vulnerable to hardware-level attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel
threat model referred to as Med-Hammer that combines the Rowhammer hardware
fault injection with neural Trojan attacks to compromise the integrity of
ViT-based medical imaging systems. Specifically, we demonstrate how malicious
bit flips induced via Rowhammer can trigger implanted neural Trojans, leading
to targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses (e.g.,
tumors or lesions) in medical scans. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
medical imaging datasets such as ISIC, Brain Tumor, and MedMNIST, we show that
such attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates
about 82.51% and 92.56% in MobileViT and SwinTransformer, respectively. We
further investigate how architectural properties, such as model sparsity,
attention weight distribution, and the number of features of the layer, impact
attack effectiveness. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
intersection between hardware-level faults and deep learning security in
healthcare applications, underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses
spanning both model architectures and underlying hardware platforms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaRAccel, an FPGA-based hardware architecture designed to optimize the FaR methodology, providing an efficient defense against Bit-Flip Attacks in Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current FaR method, though effective against BFAs, faces challenges of performance and memory overheads due to dynamic runtime activations and lack of hardware optimizations.

Method: The authors propose FaRAccel, leveraging reconfigurable logic for dynamic activation rerouting and lightweight rewiring storage to address FaR's inefficiencies. It is implemented on FPGA to reduce inference latency and energy use.

Result: FaRAccel achieves significant reductions in inference latency and energy consumption while retaining the resilience benefits of FaR against BFAs. It is validated across several Transformer models.

Conclusion: FaRAccel is the first hardware-accelerated solution for BFAs in Transformers, combining robust algorithmic defense with hardware efficiency to facilitate real-world deployment.

Abstract: Forget and Rewire (FaR) methodology has demonstrated strong resilience
against Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) on Transformer-based models by obfuscating
critical parameters through dynamic rewiring of linear layers. However, the
application of FaR introduces non-negligible performance and memory overheads,
primarily due to the runtime modification of activation pathways and the lack
of hardware-level optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose
FaRAccel, a novel hardware accelerator architecture implemented on FPGA,
specifically designed to offload and optimize FaR operations. FaRAccel
integrates reconfigurable logic for dynamic activation rerouting, and
lightweight storage of rewiring configurations, enabling low-latency inference
with minimal energy overhead. We evaluate FaRAccel across a suite of
Transformer models and demonstrate substantial reductions in FaR inference
latency and improvement in energy efficiency, while maintaining the robustness
gains of the original FaR methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first hardware-accelerated defense against BFAs in Transformers,
effectively bridging the gap between algorithmic resilience and efficient
deployment on real-world AI platforms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZK-SenseLM is a secure wireless sensing framework using large-model encoders for Wi-Fi data coupled with zero-knowledge proof mechanisms for auditable and robust decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a secure, auditable framework for wireless sensing using zero-knowledge proofs and large-model encoders, ensuring safety and robustness in scenarios prone to distribution shifts and adversarial conditions.

Method: It employs masked spectral pretraining, cross-modal alignment for RF features, and selective-abstention heads to calibrate actions. It integrates a multi-stage proving pipeline to verify inference processes, including feature sanity checks, binding thresholds, and PLONK-style proofs.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved performance in various sensing tasks (like presence detection and RF fingerprinting), achieving better macro-F1 scores, calibration, enhanced risk-coverage curves under perturbations, and effective tamper/replay rejection.

Conclusion: ZK-SenseLM provides a secured and auditable mechanism for wireless sensing tasks while balancing accuracy, robustness, and privacy through innovative model design and proof techniques.

Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a
large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave
radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end
zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral
pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal
alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.
To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated
selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is
registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving
pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version
binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the
quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and
confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a
gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates
with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization
without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are
part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,
respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1
and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and
rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.

*Ziyao Cui,Minxing Zhang,Jian Pei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in sequential data publishing, demonstrating that analyzing temporal dependencies can reveal sensitive information, despite individual privacy protections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate privacy risks in sequential data publishing, where temporal correlations across releases can enable inference of sensitive information, even if each release satisfies standard privacy guarantees.

Method: Proposing a novel attack model integrating a Hidden Markov Model with reinforcement learning-based bi-directional inference to exploit sequential dependencies for inferring private information.

Result: Attacker model successfully recovers sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets, outperforming baseline methods by leveraging temporal correlations.

Conclusion: Sequential data publishing poses inherent privacy risks, necessitating new privacy-preserving approaches like time-aware differential privacy or temporal obfuscation strategies.

Abstract: Privacy concerns have become increasingly critical in modern AI and data
science applications, where sensitive information is collected, analyzed, and
shared across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobility. While
prior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many
real-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,
where the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential
disclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across
releases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains
hidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an
attacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting
dependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual
release satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel
attack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a
Hidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional
inference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and
later observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate
our framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary
can recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive
experiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model
consistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release
independently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to
sequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can
collectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally. These
findings underscore the need for new privacy-preserving frameworks that
explicitly model temporal dependencies, such as time-aware differential privacy
or sequential data obfuscation strategies.

TL;DR: The paper presents RAGuard, a framework aiming to tackle data poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, by detecting and mitigating poisoned texts through expanded retrieval, perplexity filtering, and similarity checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address security risks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) caused by data poisoning, where adversaries manipulate outputs by injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database.

Method: The proposed method, RAGuard, broadens retrieval scope, applies chunk-wise perplexity filtering, and uses text similarity filtering for detecting poisoned texts. It integrates non-parametric techniques to enhance system security.

Result: Experiments on large-scale datasets show the effectiveness of RAGuard in identifying and mitigating poisoning attacks, even against strong adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: RAGuard improves the security of RAG systems by detecting and mitigating poisoned text effectively, proving to be a robust defense against advanced poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
(NLP), enabling applications from content generation to decision support.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by incorporating external
knowledge but also introduces security risks, particularly from data poisoning,
where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database to
manipulate system outputs. While various defenses have been proposed, they
often struggle against advanced attacks. To address this, we introduce RAGuard,
a detection framework designed to identify poisoned texts. RAGuard first
expands the retrieval scope to increase the proportion of clean texts, reducing
the likelihood of retrieving poisoned content. It then applies chunk-wise
perplexity filtering to detect abnormal variations and text similarity
filtering to flag highly similar texts. This non-parametric approach enhances
RAG security, and experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate its
effectiveness in detecting and mitigating poisoning attacks, including strong
adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: Developing specialized, automated anti-malware systems requires handling large amounts of information effectively. Current techniques show promise but face challenges related to data requirements.

Abstract: There is an increase in global malware threats. To address this, an

The challenges associated with malicious threats in phone use have become a
pressing issue in mobile communication, disrupting user experiences and posing
significant privacy threats. This study surveys commonly used machine learning
techniques for detecting malicious threats in phones and examines their
performance. The majority of past research focuses on customer feedback and
reviews, with concerns that people might create false reviews to promote or
devalue products and services for personal gain. Hence, the development of
techniques for detecting malicious threats using machine learning has been a
key focus. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of current
research on the issue of malicious threats and methods for tackling these
challenges. Nevertheless, a huge amount of information is required by these
methods, presenting a challenge for developing robust, specialized automated
anti-malware systems. This research describes the Android Applications dataset,
and the accuracy of the techniques is measured using the accuracy levels of the

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of model inversion attacks in face authentication systems and proposes a new defense mechanism, L2FE-Hash, which nullifies these attacks without retraining the ML model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face authentication systems are vulnerable to model inversion attacks where attackers can reconstruct faces from embedding vectors, showcasing a need for stronger defenses in privacy-sensitive applications.

Method: The authors formalize defense requirements against model inversion, critique existing fuzzy extractors, introduce a new attack PIPE, and propose L2FE-Hash as a secure fuzzy extractor compatible with ML-based systems.

Result: The PIPE attack demonstrates weaknesses in existing systems with a high success rate, while L2FE-Hash mitigates these threats, providing provable security and empirical usability without model retraining.

Conclusion: L2FE-Hash proves to be a practical and robust solution for mitigating model inversion attacks in face authentication systems, setting a foundation for future improvements in security.

Abstract: Model inversion attacks pose an open challenge to privacy-sensitive
applications that use machine learning (ML) models. For example, face
authentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from
face images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks
can accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no
systematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against
model inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face
authentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of
best-effort solutions.
  In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong
defense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the
cryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy
extractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so
through a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate
of over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the
first candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance
comparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face
authentication. We formally characterize its computational security guarantees,
even in the extreme threat model of full breach of stored secrets, and
empirically show its usable accuracy in face authentication for practical face
distributions. It offers attack-agnostic security without requiring any
re-training of the ML model it protects. Empirically, it nullifies both prior
state-of-the-art inversion attacks as well as our new PIPE attack.

Motivation: To address the limited adoption of the OData protocol outside enterprise systems and enhance its usability for modern web development demands.

Method: The paper proposes ODataX, an evolved version of OData, that includes simplified query syntax, query cost estimation for performance optimization, and enhanced caching, while ensuring backward compatibility with OData v4.

Result: ODataX offers progressive complexity disclosure, performance guardrails, and caching improvements, improving usability and efficiency while maintaining compatibility.

Conclusion: ODataX successfully bridges the gap between enterprise query standardization and modern web development simplicity, potentially broadening the OData protocol's adoption.

Abstract: The Open Data Protocol (OData) provides a standardized approach for building

particularly within Microsoft and SAP ecosystems. This paper analyzes the key
barriers preventing wider OData adoption and introduces ODataX, an evolved

backward compatibility with OData v4 while introducing progressive complexity
disclosure through simplified query syntax, built-in performance guardrails via

TL;DR: StorageXTuner is an LLM-driven framework for auto-tuning heterogeneous storage engines, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically configuring storage systems is complex due to varying conditions and large parameter spaces. Existing solutions often degrade with changes and are limited in reuse across systems.

Method: StorageXTuner utilizes four distinct agents (Executor, Extractor, Searcher, Reflector) to systematically benchmark, analyze, explore, and manage storage system configurations.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved throughput (up to 575% higher), lower p99 latency (as much as 88% reduction), and faster convergence compared to out-of-the-box and ELMo-Tune configurations.

Conclusion: StorageXTuner provides a robust, reusable approach to tuning storage systems, significantly improving performance metrics across different engines and workloads.

Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large
and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and
ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under
changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a
single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains
exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM
agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines.
StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed
benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided
configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management).
The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that
promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to
guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on
RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C.
Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up
to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and
56%, and converges with fewer trials.

### [396] [Large-Scale Network Embedding in Apache Spark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10620)
*Wenqing Lin*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributed algorithm for scalable and efficient network embedding on large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with handling large graphs efficiently due to computational costs and data size limitations.

Method: The algorithm partitions large graphs into small subgraphs, processes them using Apache Spark, computes embeddings in parallel, and aggregates the results efficiently.

Result: The method achieves significant speed improvements (minimum 4x faster) and better performance (up to 4.25% and 4.27% improvement in link prediction and node classification). It also demonstrates practical efficiency with deployment in Tencent's online games.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed algorithm offers scalability, computational efficiency, and performance improvements, making it impactful for large-scale graph-related applications like recommendations and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Network embedding has been widely used in social recommendation and network
analysis, such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection with graphs.
However, most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently,
due to that (i) computation on graphs is often costly and (ii) the size of
graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large,
rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine. In this paper, we
propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding
on large graphs using Apache Spark, which recursively partitions a graph into
several small-sized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural
information of nodes, and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph
in parallel. Finally, by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs, we obtain
the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost. After that, we demonstrate in various
experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions
of edges within a few hours and is at least 4 times faster than the
state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, it achieves up to $4.25\%$ and $4.27\%$
improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively. In
the end, we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of Tencent with
the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation, which
improve the competitors by up to $91.11\%$ in running time and up to $12.80\%$
in the corresponding evaluation metrics.

*Evgeny Ukhanov*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using formal verification with the Dafny system to ensure software correctness in decentralized finance, specifically verifying token sale logic against financial risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity for software correctness in decentralized finance due to financial losses caused by bugs in smart contracts and DeFi systems.

Method: A bottom-up compositional strategy for formal verification is used, involving Dafny programming and proofs of mathematical properties such as non-linear integer arithmetic and complex business logic.

Result: Critical safety and lifecycle properties verified, including refund limitations, bounded precision loss in calculations, withdrawal mechanisms, and post-sale token allocation correctness.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of rigorous formal verification techniques in creating reliable financial software for DeFi.

Abstract: The proliferation of decentralized financial (DeFi) systems and smart
contracts has underscored the critical need for software correctness. Bugs in
such systems can lead to catastrophic financial losses. Formal verification
offers a path to achieving mathematical certainty about software behavior. This
paper presents the formal verification of the core logic for a token sale
launchpad, implemented and proven correct using the Dafny programming language
and verification system. We detail a compositional, bottom-up verification
strategy, beginning with the proof of fundamental non-linear integer arithmetic
properties, and building upon them to verify complex business logic, including
asset conversion, time-based discounts, and capped-sale refund mechanics. The
principal contributions are the formal proofs of critical safety and lifecycle
properties. Most notably, we prove that refunds in a capped sale can never
exceed the user's original deposit amount, and that the precision loss in
round-trip financial calculations is strictly bounded. Furthermore, we verify
the complete lifecycle logic, including user withdrawals under various sale
mechanics and the correctness of post-sale token allocation, vesting, and
claiming. This work serves as a comprehensive case study in applying rigorous
verification techniques to build high-assurance financial software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a secure and privacy-preserving medical image classification framework that addresses data heterogeneity, non-IID data, and high communication costs in federated learning.

Method: A novel federated learning (FL) approach, CFL-SparseMed, applies Top-k Sparsification to selectively transmit only the top k gradients, reducing communication overhead.

Result: The proposed approach effectively handles data heterogeneity, maintains model accuracy, improves diagnostic outcomes, and ensures privacy preservation in non-IID medical imaging contexts.

Conclusion: CFL-SparseMed offers an efficient, privacy-preserving solution for medical image classification in federated learning environments, addressing network constraints and data inconsistencies.

### [400] [DMVFC: Deep Learning Based Functionally Consistent Tractography Fiber Clustering Using Multimodal Diffusion MRI and Functional MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24770)
*Bocheng Guo,Jin Wang,Yijie Li,Junyi Wang,Mingyu Gao,Puming Feng,Yuqian Chen,Jarrett Rushmore,Nikos Makris,Yogesh Rathi,Lauren J O'Donnell,Fan Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new deep learning framework, DMVFC, which improves white matter (WM) parcellation by integrating diffusion MRI and functional MRI data for functionally and anatomically consistent clustering of fibers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fiber clustering methods primarily rely on spatial trajectories and miss functional and microstructural information, limiting their effectiveness in reflecting WM's functional coherence.

Method: DMVFC uses multi-modal data from diffusion MRI and functional MRI and introduces two main modules: multi-view pretraining for embedding features separately and collaborative fine-tuning to refine differences in embeddings.

Result: Experiments show that DMVFC outperforms existing clustering methods, delivering more functionally and anatomically consistent WM parcellation.

Conclusion: DMVFC advances fiber clustering by leveraging multimodal imaging data, elevating its functional and anatomical coherence compared to current methods.

Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method
for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural
connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies
primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial
trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the
functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is
increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using
functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information
for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore,
microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed
from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the
clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering
framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint
multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM
parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural
characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber
tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining
module to compute embedding features from each source of information
separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional
signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine
the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two
state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance
in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve medical image reporting by generating semantically accurate and clinically useful captions for MRI scans, addressing limitations in domain-specific captioning.

Method: The authors employ a DEiT-Small vision transformer as the image encoder, MediCareBERT for textual embeddings, and a custom LSTM decoder. They use hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive inference with vector similarity for alignment.

Result: Their model outperforms state-of-the-art medical image captioning models like BLIP, R2GenGPT, and other transformers on domain-specific MRI datasets, especially brain-focused data.

Conclusion: The proposed solution enhances caption accuracy and semantic alignment, offering a scalable and interpretable method for automated medical image reporting.

Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically
relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision
transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a
custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align
image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive
inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe
dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI
images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including
BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that
focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic
alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated
medical image reporting.

### [402] [Improving Temporal Consistency and Fidelity at Inference-time in Perceptual Video Restoration by Zero-shot Image-based Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25420)
*Nasrin Rahimi,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two inference-time strategies (Perceptual Straightening Guidance and Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling) to address temporal inconsistencies in zero-shot video restoration using diffusion models, without retraining them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot video restoration using diffusion models faces challenges like temporal inconsistencies due to stochastic sampling and lack of explicit temporal modeling.

Method: Two training-free strategies are introduced: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) steers the diffusion process for better temporal coherence using curvature penalties in perceptual spaces, and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES) reduces stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion paths to improve fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PSG enhances temporal naturalness, especially under temporal blur, while MPES consistently improves fidelity and strikes better perception-distortion trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques pave a practical path for achieving temporally stable, high-fidelity video restoration using pretrained diffusion models without any retraining or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image
restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from
temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and
complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we
address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration
using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying
their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1)
Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired
perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising
process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature
penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as
Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path
Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by
ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion)
scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these
training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable
high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion
models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and
degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their
strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal
naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves
fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional latent-diffusion model for solving electromagnetic inverse scattering problems in microwave imaging by generating multiple plausible solutions while conditioning on measured data, achieving high-quality reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the non-uniqueness and ill-posed nature of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem, improving the reliability and quality of microwave imaging solutions beyond deterministic machine learning approaches.

Method: The authors propose a latent-diffusion-based generative model integrated with a forward electromagnetic solver. This approach evaluates and selects reconstructions based on the lowest discrepancy between predicted and measured scattered fields.

Result: The method produces high-fidelity permittivity reconstructions with improved generalization and shape recognition, leveraging synthetic and experimental datasets for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: Hybrid generative models with integrated physics-based mechanisms show promise in advancing robust and precise solutions in data-driven microwave imaging.

Abstract: A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the
electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is
introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the
non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse
solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a
single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple
plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data,
thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the
non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into
the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space
of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent
with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest
scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered
fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled
datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative
labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of
scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high
quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with
excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of
hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust,
data-driven microwave imaging.

*Alejandro de Haro García,Joaquín J. Torres*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper investigates conditions for chimera-like states formation in Ising systems with non-local spin interactions, revealing rich synchronization behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how chimera-like states, which exhibit both coherence and incoherence, arise in systems like the brain that involve complex interactions and synchronization dynamics.

Method: The study models non-local diffusion using spin-exchange interactions (via Kawasaki dynamics) in an Ising chain with periodic boundaries and thermal stochasticity, analyzing the system using both analytical approaches and simulations.

Result: The paper discovers chimera-like states in the Ising model for the first time, identifying stable moving domains with distinct magnetization patterns and presenting a phase diagram with regions of differing behaviors.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into synchronization phenomena in complex systems like neural networks, illustrating the emergence of both coherent and incoherent patterns through effective non-local interactions.

Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like
states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in
contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes
in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we
introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the
whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange
interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This
setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical
(diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics
on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of
activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time
chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable
moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the
system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's
phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence
of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform
stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and
incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as
it is, e.g., the brain.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology to alleviate topological freezing in lattice gauge theories using out-of-equilibrium simulations, open boundary conditions, and tailored Monte Carlo and flow-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological freezing becomes problematic when approaching the continuum limit of lattice gauge theories, hindering efficient sampling of topology. There is a need for strategies to mitigate this to enable accurate computations in specific physical contexts.

Method: The authors employ open boundary conditions to reduce autocorrelation of the topological charge and utilize a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo method to smoothly transition from periodic to open boundary conditions. Furthermore, they design a Stochastic Normalizing Flow to optimize boundary condition evolutions.

Result: The methodology successfully scales to sample topology efficiently at lattice spacings as small as 0.045 fm. The flow-based solution improves performance compared to purely stochastic approaches, showing promise for future developments.

Conclusion: The strategies outlined provide effective topological sampling methods in the continuum limit of lattice gauge theories, offering insights for efficiency improvements using flow-based solutions.

Abstract: We develop a methodology based on out-of-equilibrium simulations to mitigate
topological freezing when approaching the continuum limit of lattice gauge
theories. We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing
open boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using
a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions
are gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational
costs of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(3)$
Yang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a
clear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we
check at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this
approach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions
in the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the
purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more
efficient future flow-based solutions.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks conditional neural fields (CNFs) for reducing spatial dimensionality in turbulent flows and explores different conditioning mechanisms and domain decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous and physics-aware method for turbulence compression and reconstruction that surpasses traditional methods like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and convolutional autoencoders.

Method: The authors use CNFs with three types of conditioning mechanisms (activation-only modulation, low-rank weight/bias modulation, last-layer coupling) and introduce domain decomposition to test performance over multiple turbulence datasets.

Result: CNFs, particularly CNF-FP, performed best in training and interpolative testing, while CNF-FiLM excelled at extrapolative accuracy with moderate latent capacity. Domain decomposition improved generalization in challenging datasets.

Conclusion: CNFs are effective for turbulence compression and reconstruction, with conditioning, latent capacity, and domain decomposition playing critical roles in performance across different scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate conditional neural fields (CNFs), mesh-agnostic,
coordinate-based decoders conditioned on a low-dimensional latent, for spatial
dimensionality reduction of turbulent flows. CNFs are benchmarked against
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and a convolutional autoencoder within a
unified encoding-decoding framework and a common evaluation protocol that
explicitly separates in-range (interpolative) from out-of-range (strict
extrapolative) testing beyond the training horizon, with identical
preprocessing, metrics, and fixed splits across all baselines. We examine three
conditioning mechanisms: (i) activation-only modulation (often termed FiLM),
(ii) low-rank weight and bias modulation (termed FP), and (iii) last-layer
inner-product coupling, and introduce a novel domain-decomposed CNF that
localizes complexities. Across representative turbulence datasets (WMLES
channel inflow, DNS channel inflow, and wall pressure fluctuations over
turbulent boundary layers), CNF-FP achieves the lowest training and in-range
testing errors, while CNF-FiLM generalizes best for out-of-range scenarios once
moderate latent capacity is available. Domain decomposition significantly
improves out-of-range accuracy, especially for the more demanding datasets. The
study provides a rigorous, physics-aware basis for selecting conditioning,
capacity, and domain decomposition when using CNFs for turbulence compression
and reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis include abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched prosody, making it difficult to produce natural, intelligible mixed-language content.

Method: The SFMS-ALR framework segments input text by script, uses adaptive language identification to determine locales, normalizes prosody with sentiment-aware adjustments, and generates a unified SSML representation for TTS synthesis.

Result: SFMS-ALR demonstrates flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability compared to data-driven pipelines like Unicom and Mask LID, providing high-quality, multilingual TTS output.

Conclusion: SFMS-ALR establishes a modular baseline for effective, multilingual TTS that is engine-agnostic, does not require retraining, and outlines evaluation strategies for quality assessment.

Abstract: Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a
major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched
prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual
and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We
introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution
(SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched
speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies
adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and
locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve
expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML
representation with appropriate "lang" or "voice" spans and synthesizes the
utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models,
SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices
from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with
data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's
flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework
establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent
multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility,
naturalness, and user preference.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of AI in sound art creation through a generative installation, highlighting a Human-AI co-creation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI can be integrated into artistic workflows to preserve and extend an artist's style and legacy through new sound generation.

Method: The authors use SpecMaskGIT, a high-quality sound generation AI model, trained on 200+ hours of a sound artist's works, to generate real-time, multi-channel sound installations.

Result: The installation generated novel and immersive sound experiences while reflecting the artist's identity, demonstrating successful Human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: The study presents a framework for Human-AI co-creation in sound art, proposing new directions for artistic creation and archival using AI technologies.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of AI technologies into the artistic
workflow through the creation of Studies for, a generative sound installation
developed in collaboration with sound artist Evala
(https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/archive/works/studies-for/). The installation
employs SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model,
to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an
immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The
work is grounded in the concept of a "new form of archive," which aims to
preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past
artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative
approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a
dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.
  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study
highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating
artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3)
ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model
was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new,
previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of "a
new form of archive." We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for
effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art
creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound
art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence. Demo page:

TL;DR: This paper investigates speech foundation models' sensitivity to voice quality variations, such as creaky and breathy voice, by introducing a novel dataset and evaluating these models using open-ended tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how speech foundation models respond to paralinguistic voice quality variations such as creaky and breathy voice, which influence affective state and social meaning in speech.

Method: The researchers used synthesized voice modifications to create a parallel dataset and evaluated speech foundation models through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition.

Result: The study demonstrates how model behaviors vary depending on voice quality inputs, highlighting the sensitivity of speech foundation models to paralinguistic features.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes the importance of voice quality in non-lexical speech perception and provides a novel approach to benchmarking speech foundation models.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct
processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual
representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially
respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.
One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,
encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation
types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and
social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely
rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to
failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic
features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through
open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether
model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce
a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,
designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work
provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular
non-lexical aspects of speech perception.

### [411] [PitchFlower: A flow-based neural audio codec with pitch controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25566)
*Diego Torres,Axel Roebel,Nicolas Obin*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: PitchFlower is a flow-based neural audio codec with explicit pitch control, combining high-quality audio generation with accurate pitch precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an audio codec that provides explicit and precise pitch controllability while maintaining high audio quality, and addressing disentanglement issues in speech synthesis.

Method: Using a combination of F0 contour perturbations, vector-quantization bottleneck, and a flow-based decoder to disentangle and condition pitch during training and audio generation.

Result: PitchFlower is shown to have superior pitch control accuracy compared to WORLD and outperforms SiFiGAN in controllability while matching its audio quality.

Conclusion: PitchFlower demonstrates high-quality sound synthesis with accurate pitch adjustments, providing a foundational framework for disentangling additional speech attributes.

Abstract: We present PitchFlower, a flow-based neural audio codec with explicit pitch
controllability. Our approach enforces disentanglement through a simple
perturbation: during training, F0 contours are flattened and randomly shifted,
while the true F0 is provided as conditioning. A vector-quantization bottleneck
prevents pitch recovery, and a flow-based decoder generates high quality audio.
Experiments show that PitchFlower achieves more accurate pitch control than
WORLD at much higher audio quality, and outperforms SiFiGAN in controllability
while maintaining comparable quality. Beyond pitch, this framework provides a
simple and extensible path toward disentangling other speech attributes.
