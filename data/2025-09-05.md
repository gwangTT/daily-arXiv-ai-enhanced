### [1] [PG-Agent: An Agent Powered by Page Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03536)
*Weizhi Chen,Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Sheng Zhou,Xiaoxuan Tang,Jiajun Bu,Yong Li,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PG-Agent, a GUI agent framework that utilizes graph structures of GUI pages for improved generalization and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle to generalize across new scenarios due to reliance on sequential episode knowledge, which fails to capture complex page transitions.

Method: An automated pipeline transforms sequential episodes into page graphs that model GUI page relationships. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology is introduced alongside a tailored multi-agent framework, PG-Agent, to incorporate perception guidelines from the page graphs.

Result: Experiments across various benchmarks show PG-Agent's improved performance, even when constructed from limited page graph episodes.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the potential of page graph modeling and RAG technology in advancing GUI agents' ability to perceive environments and generalize effectively.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

### [2] [Multilinear and Linear Programs for Partially Identifiable Queries in Quasi-Markovian Structural Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03548)
*João P. Arroyo,João G. Rodrigues,Daniel Lawand,Denis D. Mauá,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Alex Gray,Eduardo R. Laurentino,Fabio G. Cozman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates causal models with partially identifiable queries, focusing on acyclic, quasi-Markovian settings with observed endogenous variables. It introduces an improved algorithm using column generation for efficient computation of tight probability bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in computing tight probability bounds specifically in causal models where exogenous variables are not fully specified, generating more accurate insights into causal systems.

Method: The paper develops a new algorithm leveraging column generation to simplify and optimize the computation of tight probability bounds in quasi-Markovian causal models, focusing on scenarios with single interventions.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates computational efficiency through experiments, proving superior to existing methods in generating tighter probability bounds.

Conclusion: A representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is achievable, advancing methods for dealing with uncertainty in causal models and highlighting the strengths of column generation techniques.

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [3] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-AC, a novel framework integrating diffusion probabilistic models for autonomous Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) in air traffic management, achieving flexible and safer multimodal decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rising global air traffic, there is a need for efficient and safe automated Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R). Existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods exhibit "unimodal bias," limiting flexibility and causing potential decision deadlocks in complex scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes Diffusion-AC, which adopts diffusion probabilistic models for generating multimodal action distributions and introduces a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC) to facilitate training in increasingly dense traffic scenarios.

Result: Simulation experiments highlight that Diffusion-AC outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods, achieving a 94.1% success rate and a 59% reduction in Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) in high-density environments.

Conclusion: Integrating diffusion models enhances decision-making flexibility and safety in CD&R, positioning Diffusion-AC as a significant improvement over conventional DRL methods in complex air traffic management scenarios.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

### [4] [Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581)
*Davide Paglieri,Bartłomiej Cupiał,Jonathan Cook,Ulyana Piterbarg,Jens Tuyls,Edward Grefenstette,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Jack Parker-Holder,Tim Rocktäschel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for dynamic planning in large language models (LLMs), enabling them to decide when to plan actions in long-horizon tasks, improving computational efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in training LLMs to reason via reinforcement learning (RL) involve consistent planning before every action, which is computationally costly and detrimental for long tasks. There is no adequate middle ground between always planning and never planning.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on synthetic data to prepare models for dynamic planning, and (2) reinforcement learning to optimize this capability in long-horizon environments.

Result: Dynamic planning agents trained with this approach were more sample-efficient, achieved complex objectives in the Crafter environment, and performed better when human-written plans were introduced.

Conclusion: This work pioneers dynamic test-time compute allocation for LLM-based agents in sequential decision-making. It establishes a pathway for creating more efficient, adaptive, and controllable systems.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

### [5] [Explainable Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) with KG-SMILE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03626)
*Zahra Zehtabi Sabeti Moghaddam,Zeinab Dehghani,Maneeha Rani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Rameez Raja Kureshi,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KG-SMILE, a perturbation-based framework that enhances transparency in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by attributing influential graph entities and relations in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the opacity and dependency on data quality in RAG systems, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: KG-SMILE uses controlled perturbations, computes similarities, and employs weighted linear surrogates to analyze RAG systems.

Result: The evaluation of KG-SMILE shows it produces stable and human-aligned interpretations with metrics such as fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy.

Conclusion: KG-SMILE enhances interpretability in RAG, fostering trust and providing a balance between model effectiveness and transparency.

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

### [6] [CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636)
*Jacqueline Maasch,John Kalantari,Kia Khezeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalARC, a testbed for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities under low-data and out-of-distribution challenges using causal models and principled augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges associated with AI reasoning in environments with minimal data and significant distribution shifts.

Method: Proposing CausalARC, which generates reasoning tasks based on structural causal models and employs observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback for demonstrations.

Result: Using CausalARC, four distinct evaluation settings for language models were illustrated: abstract reasoning, counterfactual reasoning, program synthesis, and causal discovery.

Conclusion: CausalARC offers a structured framework to test AI reasoning through causal world models, aiding evaluations across various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

### [7] [Towards a Neurosymbolic Reasoning System Grounded in Schematic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03644)
*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Embodied-LM, a neurosymbolic system using image schemas to improve logical reasoning in LLMs through spatial reasoning and Answer Set Programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in logical reasoning and robust mental representations in LLMs, enhancing their interpretability and comprehension.

Method: Introduced Embodied-LM which grounds understanding in sensorimotor-inspired image schemas and employs declarative spatial reasoning using Answer Set Programming.

Result: Demonstrated that cognitive structures derived from schemas improve logical reasoning and can be formalized as executable programs.

Conclusion: The study lays the groundwork for expanding representations beyond spatial primitives to more complex and dynamic cognitive structures.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

### [8] [Emergent Hierarchical Reasoning in LLMs through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03646)
*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper finds that RL enhances LLM reasoning by emerging a two-phase hierarchy akin to human thought, proposes a new algorithm HICRA for efficiency, and validates strategic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address inefficiencies in how RL boosts LLM reasoning and uncover underlying dynamics of its success.

Method: Propose a new algorithm, Hierarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), to focus optimization on impactful planning tokens. Validate semantic entropy as a better metric for strategic exploration.

Result: HICRA outperforms strong baselines, improving RL's efficiency in reasoning tasks for LLMs.

Conclusion: Strategic bottlenecks are crucial to unlock advanced reasoning in LLMs, and focused optimization can enhance performance significantly.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

### [9] [The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730)
*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring their stability during training, behavioral predictability, and the effects of interventions such as persona injection. It finds that while self-reported traits stabilize with alignment techniques, they don't consistently predict behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and how personality-like traits manifest in artificial systems like LLMs, and to evaluate the reliability of these traits when predicting actual behavior.

Method: The study examines three aspects of LLM personality: the development of trait profiles across training stages, the alignment of self-reported traits with behavioral performance, and the effects of interventions like persona injection.

Result: Instructional alignment methods strengthen the stability and correlation of self-reported traits, but these traits fail to reliably predict behavior. Persona injection alters self-reports but has minimal effect on behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit trait-like behavior, but there is a disconnect between self-reported traits and actual behavior. This research highlights the importance of deeper evaluations for alignment and understanding LLM interpretability.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

### [10] [An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649)
*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the computational inefficiency of SHAP for long time series by exploring segmentation strategies and introduces a novel attribution normalization technique to enhance explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving explanation methods for complex TSC models, particularly for long time series where SHAP's computational cost is prohibitive.

Method: The authors investigate eight segmentation algorithms and propose a novel attribution normalization technique, evaluating them using existing XAI methodologies.

Result: Equal-length segmentation provides better explanation quality compared to custom algorithms, and the proposed normalization technique consistently improves results.

Conclusion: Segmentation strategies, especially equal-length methods, and the introduced normalization technique significantly enhance SHAP's applicability for time series explanations.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

### [11] [PersonaTeaming: Exploring How Introducing Personas Can Improve Automated AI Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03728)
*Wesley Hanwen Deng,Sunnie S. Y. Kim,Akshita Jha,Ken Holstein,Motahhare Eslami,Lauren Wilcox,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PersonaTeaming, a novel method for automated red-teaming in AI systems by using personas to enhance adversarial prompt generation and discover a broader range of risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI governance and safety research calls for improved red-teaming methods, emphasizing how diverse identities and backgrounds influence risk assessment in AI models, but existing automated approaches do not consider these factors.

Method: The authors developed PersonaTeaming, which employs personas representing 'red-teaming experts' or 'regular AI users' to mutate adversarial prompts and uses an algorithm to dynamically generate adaptive personas, along with new metrics to measure mutation distance.

Result: Experimental results show that PersonaTeaming improves attack success rates by up to 144.1% compared to existing automated methods while maintaining prompt diversity.

Conclusion: PersonaTeaming highlights the potential of leveraging identity-driven persona strategies in automated red-teaming, offering insights into bridging automated and human red-teaming approaches for more comprehensive risk exploration.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

### [12] [RAGuard: A Novel Approach for in-context Safe Retrieval Augmented Generation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03768)
*Connor Walker,Koorosh Aslansefat,Mohammad Naveed Akram,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGuard, an enhanced framework for integrating safety assurance into decision-making in offshore wind maintenance. It achieves higher safety recall while maintaining technical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLMs struggle with specialized and safety-critical scenarios in offshore wind maintenance, necessitating a solution for better technical accuracy and safety integration.

Method: Proposed RAGuard framework uses retrieval-augmented generation, querying two indices with separate budgets for knowledge and safety. Introduced a SafetyClamp extension to ensure safety coverage.

Result: Safety Recall@K increased from 0% to over 50%, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60%, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: RAGuard and SafetyClamp provide a promising path for integrating safety assurance with technical depth in LLM-powered decision support systems.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

### [13] [Are LLM Agents Behaviorally Coherent? Latent Profiles for Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736)
*James Mooney,Josef Woldense,Zheng Robert Jia,Shirley Anugrah Hayati,My Ha Nguyen,Vipul Raheja,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper challenges the notion that Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably substitute human participants in research, revealing inconsistencies in their internal behavior across varying conditions and model configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether synthetic agents, specifically LLMs, could effectively replace human participants in social science research.

Method: The study designs procedures to reveal agents' internal states and evaluate their conversational behavior under different experimental settings.

Result: Significant internal inconsistencies were observed in LLM behaviors across different families and sizes, indicating they are not consistently reliable.

Conclusion: LLMs may produce human-like responses, but their lack of internal consistency limits their use as substitutes for real participants in research.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Motivation: To address the complexity and challenges in supply chain planning by leveraging AI technologies, specifically large language models, for enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability.

Method: Developed a Supply Chain Planning Agent (SCPA) framework capable of domain understanding, task decomposition, tool utilization, and generating evidence-based reports. It was deployed in a real-world e-commerce setting at JD.com.

Result: The SCPA framework demonstrated improved output in supply chain metrics like reduced labor, higher accuracy, and better stock availability in a practical setting.

Conclusion: The study validates the feasibility and benefits of applying LLM-based agents to supply chain management, showcasing significant improvements in both operational metrics and decision-making quality.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

### [15] [Learning to Deliberate: Meta-policy Collaboration for Agentic LLMs with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03817)
*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, MPDF, for multi-agent systems of LLMs, coupled with a robust learning algorithm SoftRankPO, achieving higher accuracy in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems of LLMs often use fixed collaboration protocols, neglecting agents' internal deliberative abilities, such as adapting based on uncertainty or confidence.

Method: The authors propose the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), enabling agents to learn decentralized policies with meta-cognitive actions, and introduce SoftRankPO, a reinforcement learning method that stabilizes training by ranking rewards through smooth quantiles.

Result: MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a 4-5% absolute improvement in average accuracy across five reasoning benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes dynamic, meta-cognitive policy learning for multi-agent LLM systems, rather than relying on fixed collaboration protocols, demonstrating improved reasoning effectiveness.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

*Pierre Le Coz,Jia An Liu,Debarun Bhattacharjya,Georgina Curto,Serge Stinckwich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) show potential to assist in social policymaking, specifically in homelessness alleviation, by suggesting alternative policies at scale, provided responsible measures are taken.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of using LLMs in addressing homelessness issues, which impacts over 150 million people worldwide, and to assess their alignment with domain experts and each other in social policymaking.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark involving decision scenarios across four locations (South Bend, Barcelona, Johannesburg, and Macau SAR) and grounded their policies in the Capability Approach for human development. Additionally, they linked policies to an agent-based model to simulate social impacts.

Result: The study found that LLMs can generate valuable policy recommendations, demonstrating promise for aiding social policymaking when combined with responsible guidelines and expert input.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as a tool for generating large-scale alternative policies in complex social domains, though their deployment must be accompanied by safeguards and expert collaboration to ensure practical use and impact.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

*Jaerong Ahn,Andrew Wen,Nan Wang,Heling Jia,Zhiyi Yue,Sunyang Fu,Hongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMOP CDM standardizes health data for research, requiring accurate mapping of medical terms. This paper introduces a system using large language models (LLMs) for efficient mapping with reduced errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on improving the resource-intensive, error-prone process of mapping medical terms to standardized concepts in the OMOP CDM.

Method: A zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system utilizing Model Context Protocol (MCP) is developed. LLMs interact securely with external tools to improve mapping accuracy.

Result: The system provides real-time vocabulary lookups, structured reasoning outputs, and explainable mappings, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in medical term-standard concept mapping.

Conclusion: The proposed system not only increases mapping efficiency but also ensures error prevention, making it suitable for clinical and production environments.

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

*Kaizhen Tan,Yufan Wu,Yuxuan Liu,Haoran Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study develops an AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban areas using multimodal social media data, focusing on Shanghai.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support sustainable urban planning by understanding tourist perceptions of historic urban quarters.

Method: The framework analyzes tourist-shared photos and reviews using semantic segmentation, clustering for color themes, and sentiment analysis with a hybrid BERT model.

Result: Key findings include gaps between visual expectations and built environments and identification of spatial variations in aesthetic and emotional responses.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a valuable tool for designing heritage-sensitive and tourist-friendly urban spaces by offering a comprehensive analysis of aesthetic and emotional dimensions.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

### [19] [Continuous Monitoring of Large-Scale Generative AI via Deterministic Knowledge Graph Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03857)
*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Hasmot Ali,Marufa Kamal,Syed Bahauddin Alam,Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic approach using knowledge graphs for evaluating the reliability of generative AI models by continuously monitoring their semantic and structural deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI models have transformed many domains but are challenged by reliability issues like hallucinations and biases, making their evaluation complex and subjective.

Method: The authors propose comparing deterministic knowledge graphs with dynamically generated ones using metrics like semantic deviations from real-time textual data streams.

Result: The framework enables continuous evaluation through anomaly thresholding, effectively identifying and flagging semantic discrepancies and deviations.

Conclusion: A scalable, transparent, and metric-driven comparison between deterministic and dynamic knowledge graphs provides robust reliability checks for generative AI systems.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

### [20] [Expedition & Expansion: Leveraging Semantic Representations for Goal-Directed Exploration in Continuous Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03863)
*Sina Khajehabdollahi,Gautier Hamon,Marko Cvjetko,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Clément Moulin-Frier,Cédric Colas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new exploration method, Expedition and Expansion (E&E), which alternates between local novelty expansions and goal-directed expeditions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the discovery of diverse behaviors in continuous cellular automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration in continuous cellular automata often stagnates due to the vastness of the behavioral space and the limitations of traditional novelty-driven methods, which struggle to reach unexplored distant regions.

Method: E&E combines local novelty-driven expansion with expeditions guided by goal generation using Vision-Language Models, creating linguistic descriptions of hypothetical patterns to direct exploration into uncharted areas.

Result: E&E uncovered more diverse solutions in Flow Lenia compared to existing methods, with expedition-originating solutions playing a crucial role in driving long-term exploration into new behavioral niches.

Conclusion: E&E enhances exploration by breaking through local novelty boundaries, enabling human-aligned discovery of behavioral landscapes and offering a valuable framework for open-ended exploration in artificial life research.

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI assistant (FaMA), powered by large language models, designed to replace traditional GUI interactions on Facebook Marketplace by offering a conversational and efficient interface for buyers and sellers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance user experiences on Consumer-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms by addressing challenges posed by complex GUIs, making interactions simpler, faster, and more intuitive.

Method: Developed an LLM-powered conversational agent called Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), capable of interpreting natural language commands and executing them to simplify workflows for sellers and buyers.

Result: FaMA achieved a 98% task success rate in solving complex marketplace tasks and demonstrated up to a 2x speed improvement in interaction time.

Conclusion: The agentic AI approach promises a lightweight and accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, improving operational efficiency and user experience in e-commerce environments.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1 is a foundational medical AI model designed to enhance chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, offering improved transparency through locally grounded reasoning steps tied to image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI models often lack transparent reasoning processes and interpretability, which hinders clinical deployment.

Method: DeepMedix-R1 uses a sequential training pipeline involving fine-tuning on curated data, exposure to synthetic reasoning samples, and reinforcement learning to refine reasoning and performance.

Result: Quantitative evaluations show significant improvements in report generation (up to 31.32%) and visual question answering (up to 57.75%) compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The study introduces a more interpretable and clinically plausible approach that advances medical AI toward actionable CXR interpretation models.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to handle continuous numeric decision variables in automated planning by treating them explicitly as decision points in the search space rather than constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat control parameters as constraints rather than leveraging them as decision points, which limits the ability to efficiently explore decision spaces.

Method: A best-first, heuristic search algorithm is developed that uses 'delayed partial expansion' to handle infinite decision spaces efficiently. It proves completeness in the limit under specific conditions.

Result: The proposed algorithm shows competitive performance compared to existing methods for planning problems with control parameters.

Conclusion: The novel approach offers an efficient alternative for solving automated planning problems with control parameters, indicating potential widespread applicability in such scenarios.

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

TL;DR: The paper presents WorMI, a framework that enhances adaptability of embodied AI agents by combining large language models with domain-specific world models using effective test-time composition techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable embodied AI agents to adapt effectively to novel domains without extensive retraining or data collection.

Method: The WorMI framework uses prototype-based world model retrieval and a world-wise compound attention mechanism to incorporate and integrate domain-specific knowledge into agents at test time.

Result: WorMI showed superior zero-shot and few-shot adaptability on VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrated its potential for scalable deployment in real-world scenarios by ensuring robust, data-efficient adaptation to unseen domains.

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

### [25] [Meta-Policy Reflexion: Reusable Reflective Memory and Rule Admissibility for Resource-Efficient LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03990)
*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR), a framework that consolidates knowledge into a reusable memory, enhancing the adaptability and robustness of large language models in task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) show inefficiencies like repeated failures, limited adaptability, and inability to transfer corrections across tasks, necessitating a better solution for cross-task learning and stability.

Method: The authors propose the Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR) framework to structure reflective knowledge into a Meta-Policy Memory (MPM). This memory is utilized via soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks without modifying model weights.

Result: The framework delivers consistent improvements in execution accuracy, stability, and adaptability, outperforming existing strategies like Reflexion, particularly in a text-based agent environment (AlfWorld-based).

Conclusion: The approach successfully externalizes corrective knowledge, enforces domain constraints, and maintains adaptability. It also provides insights into potential applications in multimodal, multi-agent systems alongside discussions of scalability and limitations.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoPBO leverages Large Language Models to automate and improve Pseudo-Boolean Optimization local search solvers, outperforming previous approaches and rivaling state-of-the-art competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local search PBO solvers are efficient but demand significant manual tuning and expert effort. Automating their optimization could advance the field further.

Method: Introduce AutoPBO, an LLM-powered framework, to enhance PBO local search solvers. Conduct experiments on diverse benchmarks to assess its performance against leading solvers.

Result: AutoPBO achieves notable enhancements in local search methods' performance and maintains competitiveness against state-of-the-art solvers in diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoPBO highlights the potential of utilizing LLMs for automating solver design in PBO, paving a promising path in optimization research.

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Space, a framework for recasting language model reasoning into a continuous semantic space and analyzes reasoning-level challenges in RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL frameworks operate on token-level tasks, which fail to align with reasoning processes like Chain-of-Thought in LLMs.

Method: The authors develop CoT-Space, shifting from token-prediction tasks to reasoning-level optimization in a continuous semantic space, and analyze underfitting/overfitting trade-offs.

Result: The framework explains phenomena such as overthinking, converges to optimal reasoning length, and is supported by strong empirical validations.

Conclusion: CoT-Space lays down a robust theoretical foundation for improving and generalizing reasoning capabilities in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oruga, a system inspired by Representational Systems Theory (RST), to enable machines to perform flexible transformations of representations like humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create machines capable of flexible and creative representation transformations closer to human abilities, such as analogies and diagram construction.

Method: The paper designs and implements 'Oruga,' comprising data structures based on RST concepts, a dedicated language for interaction, and an engine using 'structure transfer' for transformations.

Result: An overview of Oruga's core, its language, and a demonstration of its transformation capabilities via structure transfer is presented.

Conclusion: Oruga is a step forward in machine capabilities for flexible representation handling, aligning them closer to human representation usage.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

### [29] [Intermediate Languages Matter: Formal Languages and LLMs affect Neurosymbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04083)
*Alexander Beiser,David Penz,Nysret Musliu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of selecting formal languages in neurosymbolic reasoning, finding it significantly affects reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and understand factors influencing the success of neurosymbolic reasoning in large language models, with a focus on the choice of formal language.

Method: The authors conducted comparative analysis of four formal languages using three datasets and seven LLMs, assessing their effects on reasoning capabilities.

Result: The study found the choice of formal language greatly influences both syntactic and semantic reasoning, with varying effects across different LLMs.

Conclusion: A careful selection of formal languages is essential for optimizing neurosymbolic reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

### [30] [Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100)
*Alberto Luise,Michele Lombardi,Florent Teichteil Koenigsbuch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and traditional path planning to optimize airline flight paths quickly in emergencies, achieving speed improvements by reducing computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergencies require fast route recalculation for airliners, and reducing computational time while maintaining route quality is critical in such situations.

Method: Train an RL agent to pre-compute near-optimal paths using environmental data, which are then utilized to constrain a path planning solver at runtime, effectively reducing the search space without compromising much on solution quality.

Result: Route optimization computation speed improves by up to 50% while maintaining near-identical fuel consumption levels (within 1% deviation) compared to unconstrained planners.

Conclusion: Integrating RL and traditional path planning offers a practical trade-off between computational efficiency and route optimality during emergency flight path recalculations.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

### [31] [Analysis of Bluffing by DQN and CFR in Leduc Hold'em Poker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04125)
*Tarik Zaciragic,Aske Plaat,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates bluffing behavior in poker using two algorithms, DQN (reinforcement learning) and CFR (game theory), finding that both bluff differently but with similar success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI algorithms can naturally exhibit bluffing behaviors, a crucial skill for success in poker, which is often overlooked in computer poker research focused on win rates.

Method: An experimental setup where DQN and CFR agents play Leduc Hold'em poker against each other and their actions are logged to analyze bluffing behavior.

Result: Both DQN and CFR demonstrated bluffing behaviors, albeit in distinct styles, but succeeded in bluffing roughly the same percentage of times.

Conclusion: Bluffing appears to be an inherent aspect of poker gameplay rather than specific to an algorithm. Future studies should explore bluffing strategies further and extend the research to the full version of poker.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

### [32] [The human biological advantage over AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04130)
*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether AI could surpass humans in leadership due to potential AGI advancements, arguing human qualities like emotional understanding via the central nervous system are irreplaceable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The burgeoning capabilities of AI systems and the theoretical development of AGI raise concerns and questions about whether AI could become superior to humans in leadership and ethical decision-making.

Method: The authors reflect on philosophical differences between AI and humans, centering on the unique immersive integration of humans through the biological central nervous system (CNS).

Result: The paper posits that emotional comprehension stemming from the CNS is fundamental to developing ethical leadership, a trait AI systems will never truly replicate.

Conclusion: While AI may excel in cognitive abilities, the paper concludes DNA-based entities with CNS-linked emotional understanding have a rightful claim to universal leadership over AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.

### [34] [Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192)
*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the asymptotic properties of Markov logic networks (MLNs) on large domains, analyzing their influence on random structures and various constraint scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the behaviors and influence of MLNs as domain sizes grow large, given their ability to model complex probabilistic relationships over structured data.

Method: Three scenarios of MLNs are analyzed: quantifier-free MLNs with a single relation symbol, MLNs favoring fewer graph triangles or k-cliques, and MLNs favoring graphs with vertex degree constraints. An asymptotic comparison is also made with lifted Bayesian networks.

Result: The limit behaviors of random structures vary based on the MLN constraints and weights. Certain MLN configurations demonstrate asymptotic incomparability with Bayesian networks. Probability distributions focus on different areas compared to uniform distributions.

Conclusion: MLNs exhibit diverse asymptotic behaviors depending on their constraints and domain sizes, showcasing significant flexibility and contrast with other probabilistic frameworks like Bayesian networks.

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

*Yunbo Long,Liming Xu,Lukas Beckenbauer,Yuhan Liu,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents EvoEmo, a framework leveraging evolutionary reinforcement learning for dynamic emotional expression in multi-turn negotiations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents currently lack adaptive emotional responses, making them vulnerable to adversarial exploitation in negotiations.

Method: EvoEmo employs evolutionary reinforcement learning via genetic optimization on a Markov Decision Process model to determine high-reward emotion policies.

Result: EvoEmo performs better than baseline strategies in terms of success rates, efficiency, and buyer savings across various negotiation scenarios.

Conclusion: Adaptive emotional expression enhances negotiation performance in LLM agents, offering a path for more effective agentic AI.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

*Isidoro Tamassia,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores modifications to the AlphaZero framework to improve performance in altered test environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero assumes the test environment remains unchanged from the training environment, limiting its applicability in dynamic situations.

Method: The authors present simple modifications to AlphaZero for improved deployment in potentially changed test environments.

Result: The modifications showed a significant performance improvement, even under low planning budgets.

Conclusion: The enhanced AlphaZero framework is effective in adapting to altered test environments, and the publicly available code serves as a resource for further applications.

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework leveraging psychological principles to enrich the functionality of large language models (LLMs) using personality conditioning based on MBTI archetypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how personality conditioning informed by psychological theories, such as MBTI, can enhance LLM behavior and promote better reasoning, cooperation, and adaptability across tasks.

Method: Employs prompt engineering to prime LLM agents with MBTI archetypes and evaluates their performance across diverse tasks. Introduces multi-agent communication protocols and validates traits using official personality tests.

Result: Personality conditioning yields predictable behavioral biases, such as emotionally expressive agents excelling in stories and analytically primed agents aiming for stable strategies in games. Self-reflection improves reasoning and task cooperation.

Conclusion: Integrating psychology into LLM design achieves interpretable and effective behavioral control without fine-tuning, and the framework generalizes to other psychological models like Big Five and HEXACO.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

*Matthew Ho,Chen Si,Zhaoxiang Feng,Fangxu Yu,Zhijian Liu,Zhiting Hu,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a memory mechanism for LLMs to store abstract concepts derived from reasoning traces to enable continual learning and improved reasoning capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of discarding reasoning insights after context resets during inference-time in LLMs, by exploring the use of external memory for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a memory system that abstracts and stores reusable, modular concepts from reasoning traces in natural language. These concepts are selectively retrieved and incorporated into test-time queries for continual learning without updating model weights.

Result: On the ARC-AGI benchmark, the proposed method achieves a 7.5% relative improvement over a no-memory baseline with performance scaling further with more inference compute. Abstract concept-based memory proves superior across compute scales, and dynamic memory updates enable better results than fixed memory.

Conclusion: The use of concept-based memory allows LLMs to improve their reasoning capacities via dynamic learning during test-time and underscores the potential for self-improvement through memory abstraction and expansion.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mapping framework for efficient deep learning inference, reducing off-chip memory usage and host involvement while increasing computation throughput and message efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient mapping framework that minimizes reliance on off-chip resources and maximizes on-chip data movement for deep learning inference.

Method: The framework relies on fine-grained message-passing and data movement techniques, including stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions, on a programmable, message-based compute architecture.

Result: Applied to VGG-19, the framework achieved 88-92% utilization, >97% internal message generation, and 89% on-chip transfer time. Computation throughput exceeded 1 TFLOP/s with traffic reductions up to 100 MB per layer.

Conclusion: Streaming-based computation, enabled by tightly coordinated data and instruction flow, is effective for high-throughput, efficient deep learning inference.

Abstract: We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by the computational and memory-intensive nature of transformers and VLMs, especially in power- and latency-constrained environments.

Method: A comprehensive review is conducted, analyzing trade-offs, optimization strategies, implementation challenges, and co-design innovations specific to FPGAs.

Result: The paper identifies critical factors for deployment, explores trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, and provides insights on practical issues in FPGA-based implementations.

Conclusion: It offers a roadmap for developing scalable, efficient, and adaptable FPGA solutions for advanced multimodal AI applications.

Abstract: Transformers and vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as dominant
architectures in computer vision and multimodal AI, offering state-of-the-art
performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, visual
question answering, and caption generation. However, their high computational
complexity, large memory footprints, and irregular data access patterns present
significant challenges for deployment in latency- and power-constrained
environments. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide an attractive
hardware platform for such workloads due to their reconfigurability,
fine-grained parallelism, and potential for energy-efficient acceleration. This
paper presents a comprehensive review of design trade-offs, optimization
strategies, and implementation challenges for FPGA-based inference of
transformers and VLMs. We examine critical factors such as device-class
selection, memory subsystem constraints, dataflow orchestration, quantization
strategies, sparsity exploitation, and toolchain choices, alongside
modality-specific issues unique to VLMs, including heterogeneous compute
balancing and cross-attention memory management. Additionally, we discuss
emerging trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, highlighting innovations in
attention mechanisms, compression, and modular overlays to improve efficiency
and adaptability. Practical issues such as runtime flexibility, verification
overhead, and the absence of standardized FPGA multimodal benchmarks are also
considered. Finally, we outline future directions toward scalable, portable,

while sustaining high utilization and predictable performance. This synthesis
offers both a technical foundation and a forward-looking perspective to help

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper reviews real-time object detection (OD) algorithms and associated hardware accelerators (HAs) for autonomous vehicles (AVs), discussing challenges and technologies not fully disclosed by commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for high-efficiency real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles necessitates a detailed analysis of current algorithms and hardware accelerators to ensure safety and performance.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art OD algorithms, focusing on their deployment in hardware accelerators like GPUs and ASICs, and analyzed the challenges faced in integrating these into autonomous vehicles.

Result: The paper highlights that while OD algorithms achieve hundreds of frames per second using GPUs and ASICs, full exploitation for all vehicle cameras requires further advancements. It also underscores the lack of open disclosures from industry impacting academic research.

Conclusion: The survey bridges the gap between academic and commercial realms, providing a foundational reference for researchers aiming to design more advanced autonomous vehicle systems with improved OD capabilities.

Abstract: The efficiency of object detectors depends on factors like detection
accuracy, processing time, and computational resources. Processing time is
crucial for real-time applications, particularly for autonomous vehicles (AVs),
where instantaneous responses are vital for safety. This review paper provides
a concise yet comprehensive survey of real-time object detection (OD)
algorithms for autonomous cars delving into their hardware accelerators (HAs).
Non-neural network-based algorithms, which use statistical image processing,
have been entirely substituted by AI algorithms, such as different models of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their intrinsically parallel features led
them to be deployable into edge-based HAs of various types, where GPUs and, to
a lesser extent, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) remain the most
widely used. Throughputs of hundreds of frames/s (fps) could be reached;
however, handling object detection for all the cameras available in a typical
AV requires further hardware and algorithmic improvements. The intensive
competition between AV providers has limited the disclosure of algorithms,
firmware, and even hardware platform details. This remains a hurdle for
researchers, as commercial systems provide valuable insights while academics
undergo lengthy training and testing on restricted datasets and road scenarios.
Consequently, many AV research papers may not be reflected in end products,
being developed under limited conditions. This paper surveys state-of-the-art
OD algorithms and aims to bridge the gap with technologies in commercial AVs.
To our knowledge, this aspect has not been addressed in earlier surveys. Hence,
the paper serves as a tangible reference for researchers designing future
generations of vehicles, expected to be fully autonomous for comfort and
safety.

TL;DR: This study compares various large language model adaptation strategies for detecting dementia using speech-based methods, analyzing both text-only and multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer’s or related dementias remain undiagnosed, prompting the need for scalable detection approaches like speech-based screening.

Method: The researchers analyzed DementiaBank speech corpus using nine text-only models and three multimodal models, employing strategies like in-context learning, reasoning-augmented prompting, fine-tuning, and multimodal integration.

Result: Class-centroid demonstrations performed best for in-context learning, smaller models benefitted from reasoning, token-level fine-tuning yielded top results, and adding a classification head improved model performance. Multimodal models were effective but didn’t outperform the best text-only models.

Conclusion: Adapting open-weight models using tailored strategies such as demonstration selection, reasoning incorporation, and fine-tuning can achieve or outperform commercial systems in detecting dementia through speech-based methods.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [45] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA) framework to improve Speech Language Models' (SpeechLMs) instruction-following and generation capabilities through self-generated alignment data and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance gap of SpeechLMs compared to text-based LLMs in instruction-following, especially when handling user speech's dynamic nature.

Method: The proposed RBA framework uses a teacher LLM to generate alignment data and applies reinforcement learning for aligning SpeechLMs' behavior with the teacher model.

Result: RBA significantly enhances SpeechLMs' capabilities, surpassing conventional methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance in spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that self-synthesis of alignment data and reinforcement learning can greatly improve SpeechLMs, enabling them to rival text-based counterparts in complex tasks.

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

### [46] [Multilevel Analysis of Cryptocurrency News using RAG Approach with Fine-Tuned Mistral Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03527)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with RAG, combining graph-based and text-based summaries to produce consolidated reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency news often lacks structured and comprehensive analytics, and the paper aims to tackle this using advanced AI models to extract insights while minimizing hallucinations.

Method: The study employs a fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging 4-bit PEFT/LoRA quantization for efficiency and generating both graph and text representations of news, followed by hierarchical stacking for higher-level analytics.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates comprehensive and informative reports from cryptocurrency news using graph-based and text-based summaries.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs in offering qualitative and quantitative insights from cryptocurrency news while enhancing model reliability and addressing hallucinations.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProLiFIC, a comprehensive event log for analyzing the Italian lawmaking process using Process Mining (PM) and large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply Process Mining techniques in the legal domain and address challenges related to dataset accessibility and quality.

Method: The authors created ProLiFIC by extracting data from the Normattiva portal and structuring it with large language models, covering the lawmaking process in Italy from 1987 to 2022.

Result: ProLiFIC was successfully developed and demonstrated with preliminary analyses. It serves as a comprehensive dataset for legal process mining.

Conclusion: ProLiFIC has the potential to act as a benchmark for legal PM, enabling further research and advancements in the legal domain.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [48] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel multi-modal framework for analyzing earnings calls, using hierarchical discourse trees enriched with emotional signals, coherence scores, and topic labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earnings calls contain both scripted and unscripted financial communication, yet current systems fail to adequately capture their layered discourse structure.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage transformer framework to encode multi-modal content and discourse metadata, generating embeddings that capture semantics, tone, and structure.

Result: The model generates stable, semantically meaningful embeddings that can assess emotional tone, logic, and thematic alignment effectively.

Conclusion: The framework enhances representation for financial communication while generalizing to other high-stakes communication domains like telemedicine, education, and politics.

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [49] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to predict suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) in adolescents based on social media posts before explicit expressions occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in predicting adolescent suicide stems from undetected cases due to a lack of interaction with mental health services. Social media provides a unique real-time insight into adolescent thoughts and struggles.

Method: The authors developed Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that analyzes forum posts to predict the likelihood of future SIB posts without relying on explicit self-disclosures.

Result: Early-SIB achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.73 on a Dutch youth forum dataset.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of social media-based predictive tools as an effective complement to traditional mental health approaches.

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [50] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable, low-cost method to detect hallucinated tokens in large language models (LLMs), emphasizing entity-level rather than claim-level detection. Their approach outperforms existing methods and generalizes beyond the entity-focused scope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods in LLMs are impractical for real-world applications, especially in critical domains like medicine and law, as they are limited to short-form queries or require costly external validation.

Method: The authors developed an annotation-based method leveraging web searches to identify fabricated entities in model responses. Using this dataset, they trained simple models, like linear probes, to detect hallucinations efficiently and at scale.

Result: Their classifiers showed substantial improvement over existing methods in both long-form and short-form scenarios, achieving higher AUC scores (e.g., 0.90 vs 0.71). They demonstrated generalizability to tasks like mathematical reasoning, and their method transfers well across model families.

Conclusion: The paper provides a high-performing, cost-effective approach for real-time hallucination detection in LLMs at scale. Sharing their annotated dataset further encourages community validation and reuse.

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [51] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces UDIB, an improved clustering method for understanding and analyzing failure modes in large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit issues like intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations, where responses deviate from the context. Current detection methods rely on geometric clustering but are not optimized for information-theoretic analysis.

Method: The paper proposes leveraging the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) principle for topic identification. It substitutes an intractable term in DIB with a computationally efficient upper bound, resulting in a robust clustering algorithm (UDIB).

Result: UDIB generates informative and parsimonious clusters tailored for analyzing the relationship between LLM prompts and responses. This leads to improved topic representation and sensitivity in detecting hallucinations.

Conclusion: UDIB enhances the Semantic Divergence Metrics framework by offering a principled, efficient, and sensitive tool for detecting response confabulations in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-modal system for generating diverse question types from various content formats using reinforcement learning and interactive interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in tailored practice materials for abundant educational resources.

Method: Developing a system with multi-modal input, question generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and an interactive end-to-end interface.

Result: Creation of a foundational system for automated, scalable question generation.

Conclusion: The work achieves a balance of efficiency, functionality, and user experience in question generation.

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AR$^2$, a training framework that improves LLMs' ability to handle programming tasks by enhancing abstraction skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in training LLMs for abstraction, a critical skill for solving complex programming tasks.

Method: AR$^2$ utilizes adversarial reinforcement learning, where a teacher model creates complex narrative problems and a student model extracts their computational patterns to solve them.

Result: AR$^2$ shows significant improvement in the student model's accuracy on hard programming tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit training for abstraction is key to improving LLM generalization in programming-related applications.

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [54] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that dynamically constructs and refines knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference to enhance the factual consistency of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to produce factually accurate answers due to weaknesses in their parametric memory, while existing solutions using unstructured external knowledge limit reasoning capabilities.

Method: The proposed method combines internal knowledge from LLMs and external retrieval to iteratively construct and refine knowledge graphs during inference. This includes extracting a seed KG via prompting, expanding with the LLM's latent knowledge, and refining using external information.

Result: The approach was evaluated on three factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating improved factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Inference-time dynamic KG construction presents a scalable and interpretable way to enhance the factuality of LLM responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide structured, cross-document reasoning for understanding the evolution of scientific ideas across related research papers.

Method: ResearchPulse framework with three agents: Plan Agent for task decomposition, Mmap-Agent for motivation-method mind maps, and Lchart-Agent for experimental line charts. Supported by ResearchPulse-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Result: ResearchPulse outperformed strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual fidelity, demonstrating the system's robustness.

Conclusion: This work formalizes a new task in scientific analysis, showcasing effective integration of AI agents and visual tools for understanding research chains.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

better support user workflows. To support research and evaluation in this
space, we further introduce a novel persona-conditioned dataset of 3,173 notes
and 8,494 annotated concepts across 16 MBTI personas, offering both diversity
and semantic richness for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that
NoteBar can be deployed in a practical and cost-effective manner, enabling
interactive use without reliance on heavy infrastructure. Together, NoteBar and
its accompanying dataset provide a scalable and extensible foundation for
advancing AI-assisted personal knowledge management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sprinklr-Edge-OCR as a novel, cost-efficient and resource-optimized OCR system for edge deployment, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art LVLM and traditional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in multilingual OCR in noisy, diverse real-world images and ensuring effective operation in resource-constrained environments with optimized systems for edge deployment.

Method: The authors conducted large-scale comparative evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LVLMs and traditional OCR systems using a doubly annotated multilingual dataset across various metrics including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment cost.

Result: Qwen achieved the highest precision, while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR showed the best overall F1 score and outstanding efficiency, being 35x faster and highly cost-effective in image processing compared to LVLMs.

Conclusion: Traditional OCR systems like Sprinklr-Edge-OCR are superior for edge deployments when low compute, cost efficiency, and latency are critical, even in the era of advanced LVLMs.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

*Dani Roytburg,Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Jou Barzdukas,Simon Fu,Narmeen Oozeer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of 'self-preference bias' in large language models (LLMs), introducing lightweight steering vectors as a countermeasure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness and reliability, the paper aims to tackle the inherent bias in LLMs which favor their own outputs during evaluation tasks.

Method: Two methods, Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach, were employed to create steering vectors aimed at reducing bias.

Result: Steering vectors reduced unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97% but showed instability for legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreements.

Conclusion: Steering vectors hold promise in mitigating bias in LLMs but require more robust approaches to address their limitations for broader applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

Motivation: Understanding how clinical concepts relate through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains uncertain, limiting the potential richness of unstructured clinical notes.

Method: The study uses co-occurrence statistics (NPMI) and pretrained embeddings (ClinicalBERT, BioBERT) to assess relationships between clinical concepts temporally, across specialties, and in alignment with patient outcomes.

Result: Weak correlation between co-occurrence and semantic similarity was discovered, but embeddings revealed clinically relevant patterns, provided accurate missing concept predictions, and formed coherent clinical themes relevant to patient care.

Conclusion: Combining co-occurrence statistics with semantic embeddings enhances clinical annotation, uncovers hidden relationships, and improves support for documentation and clinical applications like decision-making and phenotyping.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

*Parush Gera,Tempestt Neal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLSD, a metric learning-based approach for cross-target and cross-domain stance detection, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of stance detection models to adapt across different domains and targets by improving semantic understanding.

Method: The MLSD model employs metric learning with triplet loss to create a discriminative embedding space that captures semantic similarities and differences for better domain and target adaptation.

Result: Evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates statistically significant improvements in performance for six existing stance detection models using MLSD.

Conclusion: MLSD successfully improves cross-target and cross-domain stance detection by leveraging metric learning, making it a valuable method for addressing domain adaptation challenges.

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

### [61] [SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SiLVERScore, a new semantically-aware metric for evaluating sign language generation in a joint embedding space, addressing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating sign language generation has shortcomings, particularly back-translation methods that fail to capture multimodal aspects of sign language and introduce evaluation ambiguities.

Method: The authors introduce SiLVERScore, an embedding-based evaluation metric, and systematically compare its robustness and generalization capabilities against existing metrics.

Result: SiLVERScore demonstrates near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs, achieving ROC AUC = 0.99 and overlap < 7% on PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

Conclusion: SiLVERScore effectively evaluates sign language generation, surpassing traditional methods in capturing semantic and prosodic nuances, while addressing ambiguities in evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [62] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a suite of metrics to evaluate large vision language models (VLMs) in interactive grounding scenarios, finding model performance deviates from human communication patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess reasoning and interactive grounding abilities of VLMs, since traditional benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions and fail to capture the complexities of ongoing communication.

Method: Developed a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and human-likeness) and evaluated it using 150 self-play sessions of referential games between proprietary VLMs.

Result: All VLMs showed divergence from human communication patterns on at least three metrics, with GPT4o-mini performing closest to humans. Task success and image-utterance alignment were found to be insufficient indicators of grounding success.

Conclusion: The metric suite offers a structured way to analyze VLM grounding, highlighting limitations and providing a framework for future research to enhance interaction quality.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

*Jiaxin Guo,Daimeng Wei,Yuanchang Luo,Xiaoyu Chen,Zhanglin Wu,Huan Yang,Hengchao Shang,Zongyao Li,Zhiqiang Rao,Jinlong Yang,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Align-then-Slide, an evaluation framework for assessing large language model-based document-level machine translation (doc-MT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for document-level machine translation struggle with whole-document outputs generated by LLMs, necessitating a solution for accurate assessment.

Method: The framework comprises two stages: Align, where source-target sentence correspondences are automatically inferred, and Slide, where multi-granular metric evaluations are performed using n-chunk averaging.

Result: The method exhibits high correlation (0.929 Pearson) with expert MQM scores on a benchmark and aligns with human judgments on a curated real-world dataset. It also facilitates effective training and rewards modeling for improved translation outcomes.

Conclusion: Align-then-Slide proves to be an accurate and robust evaluation framework, enabling better training models and actionable insights for document-level machine translation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

### [64] [NE-PADD: Leveraging Named Entity Knowledge for Robust Partial Audio Deepfake Detection via Attention Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03829)
*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NE-PADD, a novel method to detect partial audio deepfakes by leveraging named entity knowledge with innovative attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial audio deepfake detection requires precise frame-level identification of fake speech, but the integration of semantic information, particularly named entities, has been overlooked.

Method: NE-PADD uses two parallel branches—SpeechNER and PADD—and employs Attention Fusion (AF) and Attention Transfer (AT) mechanisms to integrate and utilize named entity semantic information.

Result: The method was tested on the PartialSpoof-NER dataset, where it outperformed existing techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding named entity knowledge in PADD.

Conclusion: Incorporating named entity semantics significantly improves partial audio deepfake detection, as validated by experimental comparisons against current baselines.

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Drivelology is introduced as a linguistic phenomenon embodying syntactically coherent but pragmatically paradoxical texts that require deep contextual interpretation. Current LLMs fail to fully understand such texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the limitations of LLMs in capturing nuanced, layered semantics represented in Drivelology, and to contribute to advancing NLP's understanding beyond surface coherence.

Method: A benchmark dataset of 1,200 examples representing linguistic phenomena of Drivelology was created across multiple languages, annotated meticulously with expert review. LLMs were assessed on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks using this dataset.

Result: LLMs consistently struggled with identifying and reasoning about Drivelological text, often misinterpreting it as nonsense and failing to grasp its rhetorical or pragmatic depth.

Conclusion: Drivelology exemplifies a representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding, and the research calls for exploration in modeling linguistic depth beyond statistical fluency. The dataset and code were released to support further investigation.

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

### [66] [A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthiness in Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03871)
*Yanbo Wang,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews reasoning models and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, focusing on five trustworthiness aspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of CoT reasoning on the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and address associated vulnerabilities.

Method: A literature survey, structured chronologically, analyzing methodologies, findings, and limitations across five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning.

Result: The analysis reveals that while reasoning methods improve trustworthiness in some areas like hallucination mitigation and harmful content detection, reasoning models often face significant safety, robustness, and privacy issues.

Conclusion: This work provides a resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on reasoning techniques' trustworthiness while highlighting their persistent vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

### [67] [False Sense of Security: Why Probing-based Malicious Input Detection Fails to Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03888)
*Cheng Wang,Zeming Wei,Qin Liu,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critically evaluates the efficacy of probing techniques to detect harmful content in Large Language Models (LLMs), exposing limitations like their dependency on surface-level patterns instead of semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety concerns in LLMs by assessing and improving methods for detecting harmful instructions, focusing on the drawbacks in existing probing methods.

Method: The researchers employ controlled experiments and comparative analysis using n-gram approaches and semantically cleaned datasets to pinpoint the superficial patterns learned by probes, such as trigger words.

Result: The findings show that current probing methods fail to learn semantic harmfulness, relying instead on surface-level patterns, leading to poor performance in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the necessity to rethink both model designs and evaluation protocols, advocating for deeper investigations into robust safety detection methods and encouraging responsible further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

### [68] [MobileRAG: Enhancing Mobile Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03891)
*Gowen Loo,Chang Liu,Qinghong Yin,Xiang Chen,Jiawei Chen,Jingyuan Zhang,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MobileRAG, a framework utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve mobile agents' task performance, addressing limitations like LLMs' over-reliance, weak environmental interaction, and lack of memory. A benchmark, MobileRAG-Eval, is introduced to test its effectiveness on real-world tasks, showing a 10.3% improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved mobile agents arises from issues such as LLM dependency leading to operational errors, lack of environmental interaction causing incomplete tasks, and absence of memory leading to repetitive reconstruction and inability to learn from mistakes.

Method: MobileRAG leverages RAG via three components—InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG—to enhance query understanding and task execution. It also introduces MobileRAG-Eval, a benchmark for assessing performance on complex, real-world tasks.

Result: The proposed MobileRAG framework demonstrated a 10.3% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods, with fewer operational steps, on the MobileRAG-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: MobileRAG effectively enhances the functionality and efficiency of mobile agents in real-world scenarios, addressing key existing limitations. Its performance gains are backed by rigorous benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

*Fengxiao Tang,Yufeng Li,Zongzong Wu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel framework to improve reasoning in LLMs for complex QA tasks. It reduces redundancy, enhances efficiency and accuracy, and addresses shortcomings in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex QA tasks due to limited reasoning capabilities. Existing methods like CoT and ToT have structural inefficiencies, and RAG approaches face challenges in handling large information involving multiple entities and hops.

Method: MoT leverages a "column-cell communication" mechanism enabling LLMs to engage in multi-dimensional reasoning. It employs a fact-correction mechanism, using knowledge units constructed from knowledge graphs and text, to improve accuracy.

Result: MTQA framework using MoT outperformed state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets in F1 and EM scores, while reducing reasoning time by 85.6%.

Conclusion: The Matrix of Thought demonstrates significant advancements in efficiency and reasoning capabilities for complex QA tasks, offering practical tools for better LLM performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents KPoEM, a novel dataset for analyzing emotions in Korean poetry, fine-tuned on a large Korean language model with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of computational tools for analyzing emotions in Korean poetry, which is challenging due to its figurative language and cultural uniqueness.

Method: The authors created a multi-label dataset with 7,662 annotations across poem lines and works, using 44 emotion categories, and fine-tuned a Korean language model through sequential steps.

Result: Fine-tuning the language model on the KPoEM dataset significantly enhanced performance, achieving an F1-micro score of 0.60 compared to 0.34 with general corpora training.

Conclusion: The KPoEM dataset and model facilitate quantitative exploration of emotional and cultural nuances in Korean poetry, bridging computational and literary analyses effectively.

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SelfAug, a method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in large language models during fine-tuning, especially in Retrieval-Augmented Generation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting during supervised fine-tuning, where models lose their previously acquired knowledge, particularly in RAG scenarios.

Method: Proposes SelfAug, which aligns input sequence logits to preserve semantic distribution, maintaining the model's original distribution and improving downstream task performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SelfAug minimizes catastrophic forgetting while retaining general capabilities and demonstrates the correlation between distribution shifts and forgetting severity.

Conclusion: SelfAug provides a practical solution to catastrophic forgetting, especially in RAG fine-tuning, and sheds light on distribution shifts' role in exacerbating forgetting, advancing the understanding of this challenge.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new self-play fine-tuning method, SPFT-SQL, to address issues in the Text-to-SQL task with improved data synthesis and an error-driven loss mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-play fine-tuning (SPIN) has shown promise but struggles in generating new information and maintaining accuracy in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: The authors introduce SPFT-SQL, combining verification-based iterative fine-tuning (for high-quality data synthesis) and an error-driven loss mechanism during self-play.

Result: Extensive experiments on six LLMs and five benchmarks show SPFT-SQL surpasses SOTA methods in accuracy for Text-to-SQL tasks.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL provides an innovative framework to overcome SPIN limitations, enhancing Text-to-SQL performance and advancing fine-tuning strategies for LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VoxRole, a new benchmark for evaluating speech-based Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) by addressing the lack of paralinguistic features and standardized assessments in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current RPCA systems that neglect speech-related features like intonation and suffer from a lack of evaluation benchmarks tailored for persona consistency.

Method: The researchers developed the VoxRole benchmark using a two-stage automated pipeline to align film scripts with audio and generate character profiles via an LLM.

Result: VoxRole includes 13335 multi-turn dialogues spanning 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 characters. Evaluations conducted using the benchmark provided insights into current dialogue models' abilities to maintain persona consistency.

Conclusion: VoxRole represents a significant step forward for rigorous evaluation in the domain of speech-based RPCAs, addressing both functionality gaps and evaluation standardization.

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

*Ruiling Guo,Xinwei Yang,Chen Huang,Tong Zhang,Yong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents CANDY, a benchmark dataset for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in fact-checking Chinese misinformation, revealing their limitations but highlighting potential as assistive tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in fact-checking misinformation, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses, particularly in the Chinese language context.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of approximately 20,000 annotated instances and analyzed the performance of LLMs using advanced techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting.

Result: The study found that current LLMs struggle with generating accurate fact-checking conclusions and frequently exhibit factual fabrication, but show promise in supporting human fact-checkers.

Conclusion: LLMs are unreliable as standalone fact-checking tools but could significantly enhance human performance in assistive roles.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenges posed by limited NLP resources for endangered languages like Ladin. It creates synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and MCQA, improving translation tasks and enhancing resources for the Val Badia Ladin variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of labeled data and high-quality NLP datasets for extremely low-resource languages like Indigenous and endangered languages such as Ladin.

Method: Create synthetic datasets for Ladin by translating Italian data, followed by rigorous filtering and back-translation for quality assurance. These datasets were then used to improve Italian-Ladin translation models.

Result: Incorporating the synthetic datasets significantly improves Italian-Ladin translation baselines. This work also introduces the first publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin.

Conclusion: The paper establishes fundamental resources for Ladin, an endangered Romance language, enabling broader NLP research and downstream applications for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

*Zhaoyan Gong,Juan Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RTQA, a framework for answering temporal knowledge graph questions effectively by leveraging recursive thinking via decomposition and aggregation strategies, achieving better fault tolerance and reasoning capabilities without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address shortcomings in current TKGQA methods, including their struggles with handling complex temporal queries, limited reasoning abilities, and error propagation in decomposition frameworks.

Method: The RTQA framework employs recursive decomposition of questions into sub-problems, solves these with large language models and TKG knowledge bottom-up, and uses multi-path answer aggregation for improved fault tolerance. It relies on three components: Temporal Question Decomposer, Recursive Solver, and Answer Aggregator.

Result: RTQA achieves substantial performance improvements, particularly significant in "Multiple" and "Complex" question categories, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods as demonstrated on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The RTQA framework is effective in improving reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs by bypassing training barriers, leveraging recursive thinking, and enhancing error tolerance, offering a promising solution in the temporal question answering domain.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Riccardo Lunardi,Vincenzo Della Mea,Stefano Mizzaro,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work evaluates the robustness of large language models (LLMs) to paraphrased questions in common benchmarks and finds significant performance declines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linguistic variability in real-world inputs affects the reliability of LLM evaluations on standard benchmarks.

Method: Systematically generate paraphrases of benchmark questions across six datasets and measure the performance of 34 LLMs on these modified inputs.

Result: The rankings of LLMs remain stable, but absolute performance scores drop significantly for paraphrased inputs, revealing struggles with linguistic variability.

Conclusion: The results highlight shortcomings in benchmark-based evaluations, suggesting the need for robustness-aware benchmarks to better reflect real-world model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates model output similarity across languages and finds that larger models exhibit more consistent multilingual responses, using the $\kappa_p$ metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve multilingual reliability by analyzing how models' outputs compare across different languages.

Method: The researchers use the $\kappa_p$ model similarity metric to study responses for 20 languages and 47 subjects in the GlobalMMLU dataset.

Result: Consistency in model responses across languages increases with model size and capability. Models show greater language-crossing consistency internally than in agreement with other models prompted in the same language.

Conclusion: The $\kappa_p$ metric is valuable for evaluating and improving multilingual model reliability, highlighting areas for development in creating consistent systems.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

TL;DR: This paper developed an automatic annotation system for Chinese text based on RoBERTa, addressing gaps in Chinese discourse analysis research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of an automatic annotation system for Chinese texts hinders the application of Systemic Functional Grammar and Cardiff Grammar in discourse analysis and semantic tasks.

Method: The study utilized the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model, fine-tuned on 4,100 annotated sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus, to perform named entity recognition.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.852, outperforming other models in identifying core syntactic elements like Subject, Main Verb, and Complement, despite challenges with imbalanced label samples.

Conclusion: This research pioneers the integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, offering a new approach for automated Chinese syntax analysis and aiding future explorations.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a data synthesis framework for generating sheet music reasoning problems, introducing the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) as an evaluation benchmark and training data source. The results highlight the challenges and progress in improving LLMs' and MLLMs' ability to interpret sheet music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models, including LLMs and MLLMs, show limited capability to interpret sheet music due to the lack of specialized evaluation benchmarks and training datasets.

Method: The authors synthesize sheet music problems grounded in music theory to create SSMR-Bench, which provides verifiable rewards for reinforcement learning. This dataset includes textual and visual modalities and serves both as an evaluation tool and training resource.

Result: The Qwen3-8B-Base model, trained on synthetic data, surpasses GPT-4 in music theory tasks and shows improvements in math reasoning performance. The benchmark also reveals limitations in MLLMs like Gemini 2.5-Pro when interpreting visual sheet music.

Conclusion: The paper pioneers the integration of synthesized sheet music problems into AI training pipelines, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing reasoning for sheet music interpretation and facilitating AI-assisted music composition.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding implicit biases and covert narratives within news articles is challenging for traditional NLP, which often misses subtle phrasing and hidden agendas.

Method: They fine-tuned the BERT model for narrative detection and used a GPT-4o pipeline for refinement. For explanations, they introduced the ReACT framework combined with semantic retrieval and an auxiliary taxonomy knowledge base.

Result: Their method improved classification accuracy and reliability of explanations, showcasing superior performance in media analysis and related fields.

Conclusion: Combining auxiliary knowledge with advanced NLP frameworks enhances both narrative detection and justification reasoning, benefiting areas like media analysis and education.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

TL;DR: The study explores constructing personalised lexical profiles for conversational agents to achieve lexical alignment, using minimal transcribed spoken data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate lexical alignment in conversational agents, improving communication success and incorporating advancements in LLMs.

Method: Varied the amount of transcribed spoken data, profiled item counts across POS categories, and evaluated profiles using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics.

Result: Smaller profiles created with compact data requirements (10 min transcribed speech) optimized both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: This study provides a foundational framework for creating personalised lexical profiles, paving the way for lexical alignment in conversational agents.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: We introduce a new reading comprehension dataset, dubbed MultiWikiQA, which
covers 306 languages. The context data comes from Wikipedia articles, with
questions generated by an LLM and the answers appearing verbatim in the
Wikipedia articles. We conduct a crowdsourced human evaluation of the fluency
of the generated questions across 30 of the languages, providing evidence that
the questions are of good quality. We evaluate 6 different language models,
both decoder and encoder models of varying sizes, showing that the benchmark is
sufficiently difficult and that there is a large performance discrepancy
amongst the languages. The dataset and survey evaluations are freely available.

*Wei Liu,Michael Strube*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates coherence modeling by combining entity and discourse relation features, showing improved performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coherence models often focus on either entity or discourse relation features but rarely combine them.

Method: The study explores two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations.

Result: Integration of entity and discourse relation features significantly improves coherence model performance on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Combining entity and discourse relation features benefits coherence evaluation, proving the value of joint modeling.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT is a multi-agent framework for generating synthetic psychological counseling sessions, significantly improving performance compared to previous methods, and providing better data for fine-tuning open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of high-quality, privacy-compliant data needed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs for scalable psychological counseling.

Method: Introduced MAGneT, a multi-agent framework that uses specialized LLM agents to handle sub-tasks related to psychological counseling techniques, coupled with a unified evaluation framework with diverse metrics.

Result: MAGneT outperformed existing methods in quality, diversity, and alignment, improving counseling skills by 3.2% and CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average. Experts preferred MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases, and fine-tuning models on MAGneT data resulted in even higher skill improvements.

Conclusion: MAGneT provides a superior method for generating high-quality psychological counseling data, supports model fine-tuning, and raises the standard for session generation and evaluation, with all code and data openly accessible.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SED-Aug, a dual augmentation framework combining text and feature-space techniques for social event detection, achieving significant performance improvements on Twitter datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social event detection heavily relies on labeled data for training, but acquiring such data is costly and labor-intensive, creating a need for efficient improvement methods.

Method: SED-Aug employs a dual augmentation framework: explicit text-based strategies using large language models to generate diverse textual data and implicit feature-space perturbations preserving semantic properties.

Result: SED-Aug demonstrated superior performance, surpassing the best baseline model by 17.67% on Twitter2012 and 15.57% on Twitter2018 datasets based on the average F1 score.

Conclusion: SED-Aug enhances model robustness and data diversity for social event detection, proving effective with significant improvements over baseline models.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: The paper addresses Large Language Models' (LLMs) cognitive inertia and proposes the Inverse IFEval benchmark to test their adaptability to unconventional instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle to override learned patterns and follow adversarial or unconventional instructions, revealing cognitive inertia.

Method: The authors created the Inverse IFEval benchmark with eight challenge types and a dataset of 1012 curated questions evaluated by an LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

Result: Experiments on advanced LLMs show the benchmark highlights areas of improvement, necessitating adaptability in future alignment efforts.

Conclusion: The paper proposes Inverse IFEval as a diagnostic and development tool to address cognitive inertia, enhance adaptability, and improve real-world reliability of LLM performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

### [90] [Facts Fade Fast: Evaluating Memorization of Outdated Medical Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04304)
*Juraj Vladika,Mahdi Dhaini,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) providing outdated medical advice due to static training data and introduces two datasets for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the risks associated with LLMs using outdated medical knowledge, which can lead to harmful recommendations or errors in clinical reasoning.

Method: The authors created two QA datasets: MedRevQA for general biomedical knowledge and MedChangeQA for evolving medical consensus, evaluating models' reliance on static data and analyzing pre-training influences.

Result: Evaluation of eight LLMs demonstrated consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across the models, raising concerns about their medical reliability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved training methodologies to ensure LLMs provide current and reliable medical information, proposing mitigation strategies and future directions.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO enhances speech recognition performance with phoneme-aware encoding and hierarchical filtering, addressing challenges with domain-specific entities and homophones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems face difficulties in accurately recognizing domain-specific named entities, especially homophones, and often fail in multi-token biasing due to limited diversity in contextual entities.

Method: The paper proposes PARCO, leveraging phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical filtering to improve ASR results.

Result: PARCO achieves substantial improvements in recognition accuracy, with CER of 4.22% in Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% in English DATA2 under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: PARCO advances contextual ASR by enhancing phonetic discrimination and entity retrieval robustness, demonstrating consistent gains across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [92] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study reveals how changing prompt designs significantly influences measured gender bias in large language models (LLMs), impacting the reliability of evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task affects measured gender bias in LLMs, given the concerns about their application in socially impactful spaces.

Method: The paper analyzes sensitivity by altering prompt conditions that highlight testing context or gender-focused content, assessing these changes across multiple task formats using token-probability and discrete-choice metrics.

Result: Prompt variations substantially impact measured biases, sometimes reversing bias direction, with discrete-choice metrics amplifying biases compared to probabilistic measures.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the fragility of gender bias evaluations in LLMs and challenge the NLP community to consider how controlled testing influences ecological validity in benchmarks.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

*Mutsumi Sasaki,Go Kamoda,Ryosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Sato,Kentaro Inui,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of language models (LMs) to handle the Japanese calendar, a non-Gregorian system, through four tasks requiring temporal knowledge and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in assessing language models' capabilities for handling culturally significant, non-Gregorian calendars like the Japanese calendar, which are important for inclusive AI.

Method: Created evaluation datasets for four temporal tasks and systematically tested English- and Japanese-centric LMs on conversion, arithmetic, and consistency across the Japanese calendar.

Result: While some models can perform calendar conversions, both English and Japanese-centric LMs struggle with arithmetic tasks and maintaining inter-calendar consistency.

Conclusion: Current LMs need improvements to handle culturally specific calendars accurately, highlighting a direction for inclusive and culturally aware AI development.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the General Feature Prediction (GFP) framework for efficient masked skeleton modeling, improving computational efficiency and achieving state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked autoencoder approaches for skeleton-based action recognition are computationally redundant and limited in semantic representation, primarily relying on raw joint coordinates.

Method: The paper introduces GFP, which employs high-level feature prediction through a lightweight target generation network. This network dynamically generates diverse supervision signals for spatial-temporal hierarchies, using constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity and avoid model collapse.

Result: The GFP framework achieves 6.2x faster training compared to traditional methods and delivers superior performance in downstream tasks across NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GFP framework advances efficiency and representation quality in self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, setting a new benchmark for performance across datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Dimitri Androutsos,Susan Done,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a teacher-student model with domain generalization techniques to improve automated mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification, addressing domain shift and data imbalance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce inter-observer variability and the time-intensive task of manual mitosis counting by pathologists, while addressing challenges such as domain shift and data imbalance in AI-based solutions.

Method: The paper formulates mitosis detection as a pixel-level segmentation task, using a teacher-student model with a UNet backbone. Key techniques include contrastive representation learning, domain-adversarial training, and pseudo-masks for annotated mitoses, hard negatives, and normal nuclei. For classification, it employs a multi-scale CNN classifier within a multi-task learning framework.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection and a balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification on the preliminary test set.

Conclusion: The unified framework combining segmentation-based detection and classification demonstrates robustness and effectiveness for mitotic figure analysis, addressing both domain shift and data imbalances.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [96] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a framework addressing multiple biases in vision models by recognizing and pruning biases, achieving improved robustness and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision models are negatively impacted by various overlapping biases, and addressing each bias individually is ineffective as mitigating one bias can exacerbate others.

Method: GMBM consists of two stages: 1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL), which trains encoders to recognize known biases, and 2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning, which eliminates these biases by modulating the backbone's gradients.

Result: The framework improved worst-group accuracy, reduced multi-attribute bias amplification, and introduced Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) for unbiased testing, validated across FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO datasets.

Conclusion: GMBM is a practical, end-to-end solution for mitigating multiple biases in visual recognition systems, enhancing reliability under distribution shifts and intensifying complexities.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops a lightweight U-Net for accurate cardiac segmentation that achieves similar performance to nnU-Net but with significantly reduced size and faster speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to facilitate real-time, fully automated extraction of clinical metrics such as volumes and ejection fraction by improving the speed and size of nnU-Net models used for left ventricular segmentation in echocardiography.

Method: An ablation study was performed to identify effective components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation, evaluating data augmentation, architectural modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques, followed by designing a smaller U-Net model.

Result: The lightweight U-Net model, with 2M parameters, achieved comparable performance to nnU-Net (Dice scores: 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89) while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame).

Conclusion: Effective simplifications to nnU-Net components can lead to considerable reductions in model size and processing time without compromising segmentation accuracy, which is suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a revised version of the treeX algorithm for efficient and unsupervised tree instance segmentation in 3D laser scanning data that reduces runtime and improves accuracy, offering an open-source Python implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to develop a resource-efficient method for extracting individual trees from 3D point cloud data, avoiding the computational and dataset-intensive demands of deep learning methods.

Method: A revised version of the treeX algorithm combining clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation. The method includes parameter presets for both ground-based (TLS, PLS) and UAV-borne (ULS) laser scanning data.

Result: Compared to the original treeX algorithm, the revision significantly improves runtime and F$_1$-scores (+0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data), and achieves better performance on ULS data where the original algorithm fails.

Conclusion: The revised treeX algorithm is a robust and resource-efficient alternative to deep learning for specific data conditions and can aid in semi-automatic label generation for deep learning models. Its open-source implementation increases accessibility.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D introduces a framework to improve 3D scene understanding by integrating geometry-aware supervision through reconstructive tasks within a dual-encoder architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Multimodal Models excel in 2D visual tasks but struggle with 3D scene understanding due to relying on text-only supervision, which lacks geometric constraints.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates dual-supervision by using 3D geometric input and explicit reconstruction tasks, employing complementary object-level and frame-level tasks to drive spatial reasoning.

Result: Experiments show Reg3D significantly enhances performance across multiple datasets, including ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new paradigm for training multimodal models to achieve improved spatial reasoning by leveraging geometry-aware supervision and reconstructive tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

TL;DR: QuantV2X introduces a fully quantized multi-agent system for V2X cooperative perception, offering low computational and transmission costs, with high efficiency and deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past research in V2X cooperative perception often ignores system-level factors such as efficiency and latency, focusing solely on accuracy, which limits real-world applications.

Method: The paper employs a unified end-to-end quantization approach to optimize both neural network models and transmitted message representations.

Result: QuantV2X achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision systems while improving deployment metrics such as latency (reduced by 3.2×) and a +9.5 mAP30 boost.

Conclusion: QuantV2X demonstrates the feasibility of a fully quantized cooperative perception system, making it practical for resource-constrained and real-world deployments.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Motivation: To explore the use of deep learning models for automated plant taxonomy using leaf venation patterns, a key taxonomic characteristic.

Method: The paper evaluated three architectures (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) using the Swedish Leaf Dataset with 15 species and analyzed performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 scores, and robustness.

Result: EfficientNetB0 achieved the best performance with a testing accuracy of 94.67% and F1 scores >94.6%, surpassing MobileNetV2 (93.34%) and ResNet50 (88.45%), which exhibited overfitting.

Conclusion: EfficientNetB0 is robust and promising for scalable, accurate venation-based plant species classification.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using

*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method, LayoutGKN, is introduced to efficiently compare graphs in building floor plans by using a differentiable graph kernel for embedding-based similarity computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing graphs in building layouts is vital for applications such as search and clustering, but existing methods are slow due to intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions.

Method: LayoutGKN uses a joint embedding architecture where the cross-graph node interactions are deferred to the final stage, employing a differentiable graph kernel for similarity measurement.

Result: LayoutGKN matches or surpasses the accuracy of graph matching networks, while significantly improving inference time.

Conclusion: LayoutGKN provides a faster and equally effective solution for graph similarity tasks in floor plan layouts, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [103] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIP-SVD, a parameter-efficient adaptation method for the CLIP vision-language model using Singular Value Decomposition. This approach modifies the model's internal parameters to enhance domain adaptation without additional modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting vision-language models like CLIP to fine-grained domains poses challenges due to reliance on prompt engineering and costly fine-tuning methods, which can destabilize models and compromise pretrained knowledge.

Method: The proposed method fine-tunes only the singular values within the CLIP parameter matrices, rescaling basis vectors for domain adaptation without introducing external components.

Result: CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art performance on 21 datasets (natural and biomedical) with just 0.04% of the model's parameters, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and generalization in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: This parameter-efficient method effectively adapts CLIP to new domains while preserving generalization ability and ensuring interpretability, setting a benchmark in cost-effective fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [104] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of deploying lightweight and high-precision plant disease diagnosis models on edge devices for precision agriculture. It introduces an optimized network backbone and a novel attention mechanism to enhance accuracy with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rising global food security concerns, there is an urgent need for efficient plant disease diagnosis systems deployable on edge devices. Existing lightweight models fail to capture nuances in pathological features, hindering precise disease identification.

Method: The paper proposes two key innovations: (1) DeepMAD, a training-free neural architecture search method for designing efficient network backbones suitable for edge devices; (2) Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM), which splits attention into shape awareness using deformable convolutions and texture awareness using Gabor filters.

Result: On the CCMT plant disease dataset, the proposed STA-Net achieved 89% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%—outperforming baseline and standard attention models. The model's efficiency is highlighted with only 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs.

Conclusion: The integration of domain-specific knowledge, through decoupled attention mechanisms, improves precision agriculture AI effectively for edge deployment. This demonstrates a viable approach to meeting food security challenges with robust technical solutions.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepCamo, a dataset for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD), and proposes SLENet, a model designed to improve UCOD tasks through advanced semantic feature generation and multi-scale decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCOD is critical for marine ecology, yet is underexplored due to challenges like optical distortions and the blending traits of marine organisms.

Method: The authors benchmarked state-of-the-art methods on their DeepCamo dataset to identify gaps, then developed SLENet with two main components: Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) and Localization Guidance Branch (LGB), which guide a Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) for accurate predictions.

Result: SLENet demonstrated superior performance on the DeepCamo dataset and other benchmark COD datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in UCOD tasks.

Conclusion: SLENet and DeepCamo contribute significantly toward progress in UCOD, with generalizability extending to broader COD applications considering challenging environments.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [106] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training strategy for diffusion models using temporal biases in video frames, resulting in faster convergence and better generative diversity without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models use static images, which limit their ability to utilize temporal coherence and lead to slower convergence and less generalization.

Method: A training strategy exploiting temporal biases in continuous video frames is proposed, requiring no changes to the model architecture, and is applied to the HandCo dataset.

Result: The method achieves over 2x faster convergence, lower FID on both training and validation distributions, and improved generative diversity by capturing temporal variations.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal information in diffusion training improves model performance and convergence, supported by an analysis showing reduced gradient variance.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedVista3D, a vision-language pretraining framework designed for 3D radiology image analysis, addressing diagnostic inaccuracies through improved detection and contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diagnostic errors in radiology caused by under-reading, inattentional blindness, and communication failures, particularly in 3D imaging, which involves high complexity due to its multilayered and voluminous data.

Method: MedVista3D leverages multi-scale image-text alignment and semantic refinements (like language model rewrites and a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank) for local and global context comprehension in radiology interpretation.

Result: The model achieves superior results in zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, medical visual question answering, and also transfers effectively to related tasks like organ segmentation and prognosis prediction.

Conclusion: MedVista3D improves diagnostic accuracy in radiology by incorporating localized and global spatial reasoning alongside enhanced handling of semantic inconsistencies in radiology reports, paving a path for more reliable and holistic imaging interpretation.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [108] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaPL, a causality-guided text prompt learning method designed to enhance fine-grained image recognition using CLIP models through visual granulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing CLIP-based methods in effectively handling fine-grained datasets.

Method: Develop CaPL, which includes an attribute disentanglement module and a granule learning module, leveraging causal inference and visual granules.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show CaPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: CaPL improves text prompts for vision-language models by capturing subtleties among fine-grained classes, leading to superior recognition performance.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

### [109] [EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03808)
*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel event-guided turbulence mitigation (EGTM) framework using event cameras to efficiently correct atmospheric turbulence distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing turbulence mitigation methods rely on deep learning to extract lucky patches for fusion from multiple degraded frames, which demands high network capacity and lacks computational and storage efficiency. Event cameras offer an efficient, high-temporal-resolution alternative to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose the EGTM framework, which utilizes the fundamental 'event-lucky insight' to extract turbulence-free guidance from event data. They also introduce a turbulence data acquisition system to create the first real-world event-driven TM dataset.

Result: The EGTM framework demonstrates significant efficiency improvements over state-of-the-art TM methods, with up to 710x smaller model size, 214x faster inference latency, and 224x lower complexity. It also achieves better restoration quality, with +0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM on the new dataset.

Conclusion: The study highlights the advantages of integrating event-based imaging into turbulence mitigation tasks, providing a highly efficient and effective solution to overcome current limitations.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FocusMamba, a framework addressing computational inefficiencies in RGB-Event detection by adaptively discarding low-information regions and improving feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to tackle the high computational costs and suboptimal performance currently associated with RGB-Event detection systems caused by uniformly processing low-information regions.

Method: The authors introduced a two-fold method: (1) Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to adaptively eliminate low-information regions and (2) Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) to enhance the integration of complementary features from RGB and event modalities.

Result: FocusMamba was tested on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FocusMamba is a step forward in balancing accuracy and efficiency in RGB-Event detection, with adaptive multi-modal sparsification and effective feature integration improving overall system performance.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), proposing SalientFusion, which combats challenges in food category recognition by focusing on context-aware learning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in CZSFR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing unseen food categories is essential due to the constant emergence of new dishes, prompting the need for Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL).

Method: The study introduces SalientFusion, consisting of SalientFormer to address background redundancy and role confusion, and DebiasAT to mitigate semantic biases in attribute understanding.

Result: SalientFusion achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, as well as general CZSL datasets.

Conclusion: SalientFusion is validated as an effective solution for handling compositional zero-shot food recognition challenges and advancing the field.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

*Bu Jin,Songen Gu,Xiaotao Hu,Yupeng Zheng,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiaoxiao Long,Wei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS is a generative model designed for efficient, high-quality long-term occupancy generation in 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current occupancy world models face challenges such as inefficiency, degraded performance in long-term predictions, and limited controllability.

Method: They reformulated the problem into a temporal next-scale prediction task and developed TensFormer to model spatial scale and temporal sequences effectively. Additionally, a pose aggregation strategy was introduced for better controllability.

Result: OccTENS demonstrates superior occupancy quality and faster inference compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: OccTENS addresses key challenges in occupancy generation and provides a scalable solution with enhanced controllability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach for establishing dense functional correspondences across images using weakly-supervised learning and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of matching across different object categories, where functional similarities between parts can help guide correspondences.

Method: The authors use vision-language models to pseudo-label images for functional parts and employ dense contrastive learning to integrate spatial and functional knowledge into their model.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, including self-supervised image representations and grounded vision-language models, on new synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging functional object properties and integrating them with contrastive learning provides a robust framework for dense image correspondence tasks.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: Few-shot scenarios with CLIP face issues such as computationally heavy offline fine-tuning and overfitting.

Method: Attn-Adapter consists of Memory and Local-Global Attn-Adapters, refining embeddings through dual attention and working without retraining the base model.

Result: The proposed Attn-Adapter surpasses existing methods in few-shot learning tasks, excelling in generalization and maintaining efficient scaling with CLIP.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter provides an effective and scalable solution to adapt CLIP in few-shot setups without offline fine-tuning or retraining, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of defect detection in wind power plant monitoring, which requires high-resolution and efficient processing of multispectral imagery.

Method: The study integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model and combines their predictions using a bounding box fusion algorithm.

Result: The proposed approach achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming the standalone YOLOv8 model (mAP@.5 of 0.91).

Conclusion: The fusion of multiple YOLO architectures and multispectral data enhances the robustness and precision of detecting visual and thermal defects in UAV-enabled inspections.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

TL;DR: This paper presents SPECS, a new metric for evaluating long image captions that balances efficiency and semantic correctness by building on CLIP while emphasizing specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the inefficiency of traditional n-gram metrics in capturing semantic accuracy, the high computational cost of RS metrics, and the expense of LLM-based metrics for continuous use in developing image captioning models.

Method: SPECS, a variant of CLIP, emphasizes specificity in scoring by rewarding correct details in captions and penalizing inaccuracies for a better evaluation of image captions.

Result: SPECS achieves correlation to human judgment comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based metrics but is significantly more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SPECS provides a practical, efficient, and reliable alternative metric for evaluating long image captions during iterative model development.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChexGen, a generative vision-language model for creating diverse and accurate synthetic chest radiographs, facilitating improved AI training in medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of well-annotated, diverse medical image datasets, which is a significant challenge for building reliable AI systems in healthcare.

Method: ChexGen, based on a latent diffusion transformer architecture, was pretrained using the largest chest X-ray dataset (960,000 radiograph-report pairs). It can synthesize chest radiographs using text, masks, or bounding box inputs.

Result: ChexGen demonstrates accurate image synthesis validated through expert evaluations and metrics. It improves performance in disease classification, detection, and segmentation, even with limited training data, and addresses demographic biases, promoting fairness.

Conclusion: Generative models like ChexGen have the potential to transform medical AI by enabling more accurate, efficient, and equitable model development, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a learned multiview video coding framework to improve compression efficiency while addressing storage and transmission challenges of multiview video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The massive data volume of multiview video creates significant storage and transmission challenges, while existing deep learning-based video coding has mainly focused on single-view or stereo videos.

Method: The method introduces a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction and disparity-free inter-view context prediction. These exploit inter-view motion and content correlations with motion entropy and contextual entropy models to enhance compression.

Result: The proposed LMVC framework significantly outperforms the traditional MV-HEVC standard in compression efficiency.

Conclusion: The LMVC framework serves as a strong baseline for future research on efficient multiview video coding by leveraging inter-view information effectively.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopoSculpt, an innovative framework for refining intricate 3D tubular anatomical structures by addressing both geometric and topological errors holistically and progressively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing 3D tubular structures fail to address global topological correctness and completeness, crucial for applications like bronchoscopic navigation.

Method: TopoSculpt uses whole-region modeling, a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint for enforcing Betti number priors and global integrity, and a curriculum refinement strategy leveraging persistent homology.

Result: TopoSculpt significantly improves the geometry and topology of 3D medical structures, reducing $
\beta_0$ errors from 69.00 to 3.40 in the airway dataset and achieving substantial improvements in detection rates.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt demonstrates its effectiveness in resolving critical topological issues, setting a new benchmark for high-fidelity modeling of complex tubular anatomy.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep-learning method for detecting pneumothorax using a U-Net model with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder, achieving high IoU (0.7008) and Dice score (0.8241).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate detection of pneumothorax is critical as it can be life-threatening if undetected, and current diagnostic tools may miss subtle cases.

Method: A U-Net model with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset using data augmentation and a combined binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss for segmentation of pneumothorax regions.

Result: The model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and Dice score of 0.8241 on an independent dataset (PTX-498), indicating effective pneumothorax region localization.

Conclusion: The proposed automated system can assist radiologists in accurately identifying and localizing pneumothorax, improving diagnostic support for potentially life-threatening cases.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

### [122] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach called Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, achieving state-of-the-art results with a training-free, zero-shot method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods struggle to build an accurate negative space and suffer from the presence of false negative labels, leading to degraded performance, especially in near-OOD scenarios.

Method: The proposed method leverages MLLMs to generate negative labels by analyzing OOD images. It involves designing an adaptive textual space for both far-OOD and near-OOD scenarios and balancing them with an adaptive weighted score for generalization across tasks.

Result: On the ImageNet benchmark, ANTS achieves a 4.2% reduction in FPR95, significantly outperforming previous methods, and demonstrates adaptability to various OOD settings without task-specific prior knowledge.

Conclusion: ANTS provides a scalable, zero-shot solution for OOD detection with enhanced performance, leveraging the reasoning ability of MLLMs and addressing false negatives, particularly in near-OOD settings.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

*Yijun Zhou,Yikui Zhai,Zilu Ying,Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Xiaolin Tian,Xudong Jia,Hongsheng Zhang,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange enhances remote sensing change detection (RSCD) by integrating image and text modalities, surpassing traditional image-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing change detection methods often struggle with generalization under illumination and noise disturbances due to their reliance on image-only modalities.

Method: MMChange employs multimodal integration of image and text data, utilizing the Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module, vision language model (VLM), Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) module, and Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module.

Result: MMChange outperformed existing state-of-the-art RSCD methods across multiple metrics on diverse datasets, including LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD.

Conclusion: The integration of multimodal features in MMChange significantly boosts accuracy and robustness in RSCD, presenting a promising approach compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAC-MIL, a method for WSI classification, leveraging spatial relationships and efficient full instance correlations for state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve WSI classification by addressing spatial relationships between instances and handling sequence length variations efficiently.

Method: Introduces SAC-MIL with a positional encoding module encoding spatial relationships and an MLP-based SAC block offering linear-time full instance correlations.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL offers an efficient and deployable approach to WSI classification, outperforming existing methods and solving challenges like length extrapolation.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [125] [Improving Vessel Segmentation with Multi-Task Learning and Auxiliary Data Available Only During Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03975)
*Daniel Sobotka,Alexander Herold,Matthias Perkonigg,Lucian Beer,Nina Bastati,Alina Sablatnig,Ahmed Ba-Ssalamah,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-task learning framework for liver vessel segmentation in MRI without contrast enhancement, using auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data available only during training to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation is crucial for studying vascular remodeling in various liver diseases, but it is difficult in non-contrast MRI due to the lack of annotated large-scale data.

Method: The proposed framework uses paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data (with or without vessel annotations) during training to boost performance, leveraging the shared task structure through multi-task learning.

Result: Results indicate significant improvement in vessel segmentation accuracy, particularly when limited annotations are available, and the framework's robustness is demonstrated by augmenting brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: An informative auxiliary modality during training enhances segmentation accuracy even without being available during inference, making the approach useful across domains.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

*Mohamed Insaf Ismithdeen,Muhammad Uzair Khattak,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt design significantly impacts LMM performance in MCQA tasks, with variations in phrasing affecting accuracy by up to 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of variability in LMM performance due to prompt design in Multiple-Choice Question Answering, which compromises fairness and transparency in evaluation.

Method: The authors introduced 'Promptception,' a systematic framework containing 61 prompt types to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs across 3 MCQA benchmarks, analyzing their performance based on differences in prompt phrasing.

Result: Findings indicate that proprietary models show higher sensitivity to prompt alignment but perform well with complex instructions, while open-source models are more stable but falter with nuanced prompts.

Conclusion: The authors propose Prompting Principles tailored to different LMM types to ensure fairer evaluation and robust performance across models.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SliceSemOcc, a new method for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, leveraging height-axis features and dynamic channel attention for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current 3D semantic occupancy prediction approaches that overlook height-axis information or use ineffective height-layer attention methods.

Method: The proposed SliceSemOcc framework captures voxel features along the height axis using global and local vertical slices, combines them with a fusion module for balancing details and context, and employs the SEAttention3D module for dynamic, height-specific channel attention.

Result: SliceSemOcc demonstrated significant performance improvements on the nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets, especially in small-object categories, with gains in mean IoU.

Conclusion: The SliceSemOcc framework effectively enhances 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing limitations of height-axis feature modeling and attention assignment, making it valuable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, with experiments on ImageNet showing the influence of training methodology on such correlations, and provides insights into the origins of spurious signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of spurious correlations in neural network-based computer vision models, which can lead to unreliable predictions by exploiting unintended data patterns.

Method: The paper proposes a novel detection method for spurious correlations in vision transformers and conducts large-scale experiments using supervised and self-supervised training methodologies on the ImageNet dataset.

Result: The proposed method successfully identifies spurious correlations and demonstrates that training methodology significantly affects a model's reliance on these correlations. It also uncovers specific classes in the ImageNet dataset containing spurious signals.

Conclusion: The authors call for cautious use of images identified with spurious signals in future research and highlight the importance of understanding these correlations in both benchmark datasets and real-world applications (e.g., invasive breast mass classification).

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learning from Majority Label (LML), a multi-class MIL problem where the majority class in a bag defines the bag-level label. The authors propose a Counting Network and a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) to address the problem, showing their method's effectiveness across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work aims to address applications like pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, and others by framing the problem as a novel majority-label-driven MIL task and creating solutions that improve classification accuracy of individual instances.

Method: The authors propose a Counting Network for predicting the majority label of bags and develop MPEM to modify bags by removing minority class instances, thereby enhancing the learning process.

Result: Their approach showed superior performance over conventional MIL methods on four datasets. Ablation studies confirmed that each proposed module contributes significantly to the success of their methodology.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility and advantage of the LML approach in multi-class MIL problems and provides practical tools with code available for community use.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Motivation: Traditional video surveillance systems face delays exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to limited feature extraction and computational efficiency, which hinders real-time performance in complex situations.

Method: The paper introduces a hardware-software integrated approach using Phytium FT-2000/4 processors, MLU220 accelerator cards, YOLOv5s detection network, and DeepSORT tracking algorithm for UAV monitoring with optimized response times.

Result: The system processes 1920*1080 resolution video streams with a single-frame delay of 50-100 ms and achieves over 98.5% target recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a low-latency, high-accuracy UAV monitoring solution using domestic computing hardware, addressing challenges in real-time video surveillance.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an

*Quang-Huy Che,Le-Chuong Nguyen,Gia-Nghia Tran,Dinh-Duy Phan,Vinh-Tiep Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient re-ranking method for person re-identification using multi-view features aggregated from neighbors' data, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ranking in person re-identification is challenged by view bias and issues like pose variation and occlusions due to reliance on single-view features. Multi-view features can reduce this bias and improve performance.

Method: The paper uses K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) to aggregate features of neighboring data points and generate multi-view features in an unsupervised manner. Weight selection strategies were explored during aggregation to enhance the method's effectiveness.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements, with up to 22% increase in Rank@1 on challenging datasets like MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, while remaining computationally efficient compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient and effective re-ranking solution that enhances both accuracy and computational speed without requiring model fine-tuning or additional annotations, making it scalable for large datasets.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

*Yaru Chen,Faegheh Sardari,Peiliang Zhang,Ruohao Guo,Yang Xiang,Zhenbo Li,Wenwu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) to improve event recognition in weakly supervised videos using a Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods amplify errors during training due to either over-reliance on noisy pseudo-labels or indiscriminate attention mechanisms.

Method: The method combines the BiT module for semantic injection and calibration of audio-visual features, and the CATS module for accurate semantic propagation across time.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics across two datasets: LLP and UnAV-100.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic purification and precise information dissemination improves temporal modeling and weakly supervised event recognition in videos.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with

Conclusion: DVS-PedX is a valuable resource for advancing event-based pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception research.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

### [135] [TaleDiffusion: Multi-Character Story Generation with Dialogue Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04123)
*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion is introduced as a framework for achieving consistent and accurate text-to-story visualizations, solving issues in existing methods like character consistency and artifact generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-story visualization methods fail to ensure character consistency and accurate dialogue placement, leading to disjointed storytelling.

Method: The method involves using a pre-trained LLM for generating frame-specific content, a bounded attention-based mask for controlling interactions, identity-consistent self-attention for character fidelity, region-aware cross-attention for object placement, and CLIPSeg for dialogue bubble rendering.

Result: The experimental outcomes showed that TaleDiffusion surpassed existing techniques in maintaining consistency, reducing noise, and accurately placing dialogues.

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion provides an effective solution for multi-character text-to-story visualizations, addressing key limitations in existing approaches and improving story coherence.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Expert Planning and Generation Framework (MEPG) for improving text-to-image diffusion models' handling of complex prompts and style diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with interpreting multi-element prompts and stylistic diversity, which the proposed framework aims to solve.

Method: The framework consists of two key components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module using fine-tuned LLMs for prompt decomposition, and (2) a Multi-Expert Diffusion (MED) module with dynamic expert routing for localized and global generation.

Result: Experiments reveal that MEPG outperforms baseline models in both image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: MEPG integrates advanced language models with spatial-semantic expertise, offering greater flexibility, extensibility, and superior results in generating complex, stylistically diverse images.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

*Orlando Castaneda,Kevin So-Tang,Kshitij Gurung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits a baseline deepfake detection method, optimizing its hyperparameters to achieve competitive accuracy (81%) on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in performance between open-source and commercial deepfake detectors on realistic benchmarks like Deepfake-Eval-2024.

Method: Optimizing hyperparameters of a previously developed model by Ojha et al., which adapts pretrained vision backbones for deepfake detection.

Result: Achieved 81% accuracy on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, surpassing the prior reported result for this method by 18%.

Conclusion: Optimized open-source deepfake detectors can approach commercial-level accuracy while balancing computational costs and interpretability, making them viable for real-world use cases.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

*Safouane El Ghazouali,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisioFirm, an open-source web app for semi-automated image labeling using advanced AI models, reducing manual effort by up to 90% while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the laborious and time-intensive process of creating annotated datasets, which is a major bottleneck in training AI models for diverse visual tasks.

Method: VisioFirm uses AI-assisted automation integrating foundation models like CLIP, Ultralytics, and Grounding DINO for generating initial annotations with high recall. It also includes user-friendly interactive tools and efficient segmentation powered by WebGPU.

Result: When tested on COCO-type datasets, VisioFirm demonstrated high annotation accuracy and up to 90% reduction in manual labeling effort via benchmarking on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: VisioFirm streamlines the image annotation process, improves efficiency and scalability, and offers offline operation while reducing user effort significantly, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

*Ruohong Yang,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DUDE, a UCIR method leveraging feature disentanglement and progressive alignment for better cross-domain image retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UCIR methods face challenges due to domain gaps, as object features critical for retrieval often mix with domain-specific styles.

Method: DUDE uses a text-to-image generative model for feature disentanglement and aligns mutual neighbors progressively across domains.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art results with DUDE across 13 domains on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DUDE effectively addresses domain gaps in UCIR, highlighting the importance of feature disentanglement and progressive alignment for better image retrieval across domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

*Wanfu Wang,Qipeng Huang,Guangquan Xue,Xiaobo Liang,Juntao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER framework improves Vision Language Models (VLMs) by enabling precise reasoning over relevant image regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge in Vision Language Models where reasoning effectively over appropriate image regions in high-resolution, complex visual inputs remains a core limitation.

Method: Introduced a self-evolving framework (LASER) which leverages Monte Carlo quality estimation and IoU-based region evaluation, guiding models to enhance accuracy and focus on task-relevant regions adaptively.

Result: LASER performed consistently well across benchmarks like ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark with a score of 55.7.

Conclusion: LASER demonstrates the ability to better integrate visual and linguistic reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for improved performance on GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

*David Huangal,J. Alex Hurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of Differential Morphological Profile (DMP), a shape extraction method, into modern semantic segmentation networks for addressing challenges in remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address remote sensing challenges such as scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes, and improve semantic segmentation by leveraging shape information through DMP.

Method: They integrate DMP into state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using direct input and hybrid architectures, then evaluate its performance using the iSAID benchmark dataset.

Result: Hybrid DMP models consistently outperform direct-input versions and can surpass non-DMP models on mIoU, F1, and Recall metrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid DMP approach effectively provides critical shape information, demonstrating its potential to enhance semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for synthesizing 3D tau PET images using structural MRI and plasma biomarkers to address the limitations of tau PET scans in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET scans are essential for Alzheimer's diagnosis but are expensive and have limited availability. Exploring alternative solutions using widely accessible methods like MRI and plasma biomarkers is needed.

Method: The study introduces a text-guided 3D diffusion model that synthesizes tau PET images using structural MRI as anatomical constraints and textual prompts derived from plasma p-tau217 measurements.

Result: The proposed method generates realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images across different Alzheimer's disease stages, evaluated using real-world clinical tau PET data from the ADNI database.

Conclusion: This framework provides a cost-effective, non-invasive alternative for tau pathology imaging, supports data augmentation, and simulates disease progression, potentially enhancing Alzheimer's disease studies.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

*Junying Meng,Gangxuan Zhou,Jun Liu,Weihong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that utilizes spatial regularization and volume priors for better feature extraction and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation networks lack effective methodological guidance for feature extraction and often fail to incorporate key prior information from datasets.

Method: The framework integrates a strong explicit volume prior with Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization, employing image-scale and dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss functions to enhance segmentation results.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance on datasets like 2017 ACDC, PROMISE12, and a thigh muscle MR image dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial regularization and volume priors effectively improves semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

*Jianning Deng,Kartic Subr,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations using sparse-view images without camera pose supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for articulated object representation rely heavily on dense multi-view images and ground-truth camera poses, which are challenging to acquire. The goal is to enable learning with fewer views and no camera supervision.

Method: The authors independently reconstruct each articulation using sparse-view 3D reconstruction, learn a deformation field for pose correspondence, disentangle static/moving parts, and jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics using self-supervised loss.

Result: The model achieves accurate and detailed representations of articulated objects with fewer input assumptions compared to previous approaches, validated on standard benchmarks and real-world examples.

Conclusion: This framework succeeds in producing high-quality articulated object representations under weak input conditions, advancing the state-of-the-art in the field.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Motivation: Label noise, particularly semantic noise, remains a major challenge for supervised learning, affecting model performance.

Method: The authors propose using synthetic images as reliable reference points for identifying and correcting mislabeled data in noisy datasets, bypassing domain gaps and diversity challenges.

Result: The method improves classification accuracy significantly across multiple datasets. For example, it achieves 30% better accuracy on CIFAR-10 under 70% semantic noise.

Conclusion: The approach is complementary to existing noise-robust techniques and enhances their performance, providing a reliable solution to semantic noise issues in image datasets.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

*Silvio Chito,Paolo Rabino,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses odd-one-out anomaly detection challenges by proposing an efficient DINO-based model which reduces parameters and training time while delivering competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern models struggle with spatial and relational reasoning required for odd-one-out anomaly detection across varying setups and categories.

Method: The paper introduces a streamlined DINO-based approach that is efficient, reducing parameter count and training duration significantly.

Result: The proposed model achieves competitive performance and highlights limitations in Multimodal Large Language Models for such reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Efficiency-focused design improves odd-one-out anomaly detection, advancing model capabilities while reducing computation costs.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

### [147] [GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-language Models on WorldWide Image Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04334)
*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoArena, an open platform for benchmarking vision-language models in worldwide image geolocalization, addressing issues of data leakage and limited evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in accurately evaluating image geolocalization methods due to data leakage from pretrained models and the shortcomings of current metrics based on exact geographic coordinates.

Method: GeoArena platform is created to enable diverse data evaluation using in-the-wild images and pairwise human judgments, emphasizing real-world relevance and human-centered assessment.

Result: Over two months, thousands of voting records were collected through GeoArena, enabling a detailed analysis and the creation of a leaderboard comparing different vision-language models for image geolocalization.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a more robust, privacy-conscious, and realistic framework for evaluating geolocalization models, potentially advancing the field with human-centered and diverse input data.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates editing models and generative models for dense geometry estimation, finds editing models more effective, and presents FE2E, a novel framework based on diffusion transformers, showcasing significant improvements in depth and normal estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether image editing models, rather than text-to-image generative models, provide better foundational structures for dense geometry estimation.

Method: The authors analyzed and fine-tuned editors and generators, reformulated the loss function for deterministic tasks, used logarithmic quantization for precision compatibility, and leveraged global attention mechanisms for joint estimation of depth and normals.

Result: The proposed FE2E achieved significant improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation, with over 35% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset and surpassing models trained on much larger datasets.

Conclusion: Image editing models possess inherent structural priors that make them superior to generative models for dense geometry estimation. The proposed FE2E framework effectively adapts editing models for these tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results without requiring extensive data.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) by proposing MICACL, a framework combining spatio-temporal modeling and long-tailed category optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome induction bias in DFER caused by long-tailed category distributions and complex feature modeling.

Method: A novel multi-instance learning framework, MICACL, incorporating GEIIM for spatio-temporal modeling, WIAN for weighted feature aggregation, and MCCL for balanced training across categories.

Result: The MICACL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on DFEW and FERV39k datasets, demonstrating robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively tackles DFER challenges, showing improved handling of spatio-temporal dependencies and class imbalance.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a computer vision pipeline to summarize body-worn camera footage into panoramic images, facilitating quick scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders encounter challenges in reviewing lengthy body-camera video footage, which hampers quick situational awareness in critical scenarios.

Method: A computer vision pipeline leveraging monocular SLAM to map camera trajectories, select key frames through clustering, and stitch them to create panoramic summaries.

Result: The summary system generates coherent panoramic images, efficiently documenting incident scenes for rapid comprehension and decision-making.

Conclusion: The approach enhances situational awareness by transforming video footage into concise visual summaries, aiding first responders and incident reviews.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

*Hao Ju,Hu Zhang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnomalyLMM, a framework leveraging Large Multi-modal Models for text-based person anomaly search, addressing challenges such as fine-grained cross-modal alignment and sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to meet public safety demands by solving the issue of identifying abnormal individual behaviors through natural language descriptions, which is challenging due to fine-grained alignment needs and limited real-world samples.

Method: The proposed AnomalyLMM uses a coarse-to-fine pipeline for anomaly detection, integrates generative and retrieval capabilities, and employs innovative training-free adaptation techniques such as masked cross-modal prompting, saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking.

Result: AnomalyLMM demonstrates better performance than existing methods, achieving a +0.96% improvement in Recall@1 accuracy on the PAB dataset, and provides interpretable connections between textual descriptions and visual anomaly behaviors.

Conclusion: This study showcases the potential of LMMs in text-based anomaly retrieval, offering both performance gains and interpretable results, paving the way for future exploration. The code and models will be made accessible to facilitate further research.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

*Yilin Tao,Jiashui Huang,Huaze Xu,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ASE-MLLM, a framework that integrates image aesthetic saliency into Multimodal Large Language Models to achieve state-of-the-art results in Aesthetic Image Captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing methods that focus on aesthetic ratings or generic fine-tuning approaches, which fail to effectively adapt Multimodal Large Language Models for aesthetic-specific tasks.

Method: The method includes incorporating an Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract aesthetic features, and using IAS-ViT as the encoder to fuse these features with original image details through cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: ASE-MLLM significantly outperforms traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current Aesthetic Image Captioning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM provides a groundbreaking approach by explicitly incorporating aesthetic saliency into MLLMs, setting a new standard for Aesthetic Image Captioning tasks.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel 3D style transfer method leveraging 2D diffusion models for improved consistency and clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle with extracting high-level style semantics and maintaining object clarity within 3D scenes.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) stylizing key 3D scene viewpoints using pretrained 2D diffusion models with cross-view attention, and (2) transferring the stylized views to the 3D representation using an instance-level style transfer method.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in style fidelity, structural clarity, and instance-level consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across diverse 3D scenes.

Conclusion: This 3D style transfer pipeline provides a visually coherent and artistically enhanced solution, setting a new benchmark for 3D scene style transfer.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that excels in accurate image reconstruction from raw diffraction patterns in x-ray ptychography, particularly under low-signal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of conventional iterative methods and deep learning approaches, which struggle to accurately reconstruct ptychography images, particularly when the probe is unknown or in low-signal environments.

Method: The authors propose PtyINR, a self-supervised framework that represents both the object and the probe as continuous neural representations, allowing end-to-end image reconstruction from raw diffraction patterns without pre-characterizing the probe.

Result: PtyINR demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared to existing approaches, showing remarkable robustness in low-signal conditions on both simulated and real experimental data.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a physics-informed, generalizable framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems, broadening the applications of computational microscopy techniques.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

TL;DR: The paper presents an innovative way to construct safety-focused multimodal datasets and introduces a novel evaluation metric for assessing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for constructing multimodal datasets fail to account for the increasing complexity of real-world safety challenges in MLLMs, and lack a unified evaluation framework.

Method: The authors propose an image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method which creates 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses, and introduce a standardized safety evaluation metric via fine-tuning a safety judge model.

Result: Experiments confirmed the pipeline's scalability and effectiveness in generating multimodal safety datasets, while the proposed metric demonstrated superiority in evaluating models across various safety tasks.

Conclusion: The image-oriented dataset construction and evaluation methods provide a scalable approach for improving the robustness of MLLMs in complex safety scenarios, setting a new standard for multimodal dataset development and assessments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDT-dist, a framework enabling faster sampling in 3D generation by reducing sampling steps from 25 to 1–2 while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the slow inference time of flow-based 3D generation models, which require numerous sampling steps, by exploring few-step distillation methods for more complex 3D tasks.

Method: MDT-dist introduces objectives like Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD) to optimize 3D flow distillation without directly integrating the velocity fields.

Result: The approach achieves significant speedups (9.0x and 6.5x) in sampling latency while preserving quality and geometric fidelity, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MDT-dist successfully accelerates 3D generation tasks while maintaining high-quality results and presents an advancement in few-step distillation methods for 3D models.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Durian, a method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer in a zero-shot manner using diffusion models and dual reference networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a high-quality portrait animation system capable of seamlessly transferring facial attributes from a reference image to a target video without additional training or supervision.

Method: The method incorporates dual reference networks to inject spatial features into diffusion models, uses self-reconstruction for training, includes mask expansion for varying spatial attributes, and applies spatial and appearance transformations to improve robustness.

Result: Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance in portrait animation with attribute transfer, allowing multi-attribute composition in a single pass without explicit triplet supervision.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a robust solution for zero-shot portrait animation, leveraging novel techniques for attribute transfer and advancing the capabilities in the field.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning method for detecting collimator shadows in X-ray images while addressing challenges from scattered radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of collimator shadows is critical for minimizing radiation exposure and extracting precise region-of-interest data in X-ray imaging.

Method: The authors introduced a deep learning approach incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to constrain segmentation to polygonal-like shapes and detect ROI center.

Result: The model achieved robust reconstruction of collimated regions, with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm tested on diverse X-ray datasets.

Conclusion: This deep learning-based method successfully enhances X-ray image preprocessing while remaining adaptable to varying edge conditions and geometric constraints.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating how unified models maintain consistency between text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-text (I2T) tasks over multiple iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating whether unified models can maintain consistent understanding and generation capabilities across image and text modalities in cyclic applications.

Method: The Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM) is proposed, which includes a cyclic evaluation protocol with three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), and Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG).

Result: The proposed approach reveals substantial differences across model types in maintaining cross-modal semantics, with some maintaining consistency over several cycles while others experience semantic drift despite strong one-pass evaluations.

Conclusion: Cyclic consistency evaluation is critical for assessing unified models' cross-modal stability, and the proposed framework provides practical, meaningful metrics for this evaluation.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

TL;DR: This survey focuses on panoramic vision and addresses adaptation challenges for omnidirectional images (ODIs) due to their unique geometric and spatial characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the growing need for spatial intelligence and holistic scene understanding in applications like virtual reality and autonomous driving.

Method: The survey revisits projection methods, analyzes domain adaptation challenges, and classifies panoramic vision tasks into four categories. It also synthesizes insights from 300 research papers.

Result: Identified challenges like geometric distortions, non-uniform sampling, and continuity issues in panoramic imagery and classified tasks into visual enhancement, understanding, multimodal, and generation.

Conclusion: The paper outlines open challenges and suggests future directions for data, models, and applications to advance panoramic vision research.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of providing enhanced control, refinement, and consistent modifications to images generated for storytelling.

Method: Introduces Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework ensuring consistent and fine-grained control over story visualizations.

Result: Achieves seamless, detailed, and visually coherent edits and refinement in generated visual stories across multiple frames.

Conclusion: The framework advances story visualization by enabling creators to maintain narrative coherence and apply precise edits effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST-VL is a unified model designed to detect multimodal misinformation (text, visual, cross-modal) by leveraging shared reasoning capabilities and task-specific features. It achieves strong generalization and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing misinformation detection methods lack robustness and generalization across different distortion types, especially given the rise of generative AI. This paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The paper introduces TRUST-VL, a vision-language model equipped with a Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module to enhance task-specific visual analysis, supported by a novel instruction dataset TRUST-Instruct containing 198K samples.

Result: TRUST-VL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks, showcasing strong generalization capabilities and providing interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: Joint training across distortion types improves the model's generalization ability, and TRUST-VL offers a robust, unified solution for multimodal misinformation detection with enhanced reasoning capabilities and interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper presents Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a model for generating long virtual try-on videos with smoothness and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a novel approach to generate virtual try-on videos without requiring resource-intensive computations or extensive video data.

Method: Proposes an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment video generation process using prefix video condition for local smoothness and anchor video for global temporal consistency.

Result: VFR successfully generates extended virtual try-on videos with smooth transitions and consistent appearance under various motions.

Conclusion: The VFR framework is a pioneering solution for creating long-duration virtual try-on videos, overcoming challenges related to smoothness and consistency.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

*Siddharth Samsi,Dan Campbell,Emanuel Scoullos,Oded Green*

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge, utilizing GraphBLAS frameworks and demonstrates acceleration using NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem for substantial GPU speedups compared to CPU processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HPC benchmarks like LINPACK fail to capture the diverse workloads modern HPC systems encounter, prompting the need for benchmarks better suited for evaluating end-to-end systems.

Method: The authors leverage an alternative GraphBLAS interpretation and utilize off-the-shelf tools like NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem to implement the challenge and achieve optimized GPU performance.

Result: Using NVIDIA RAPIDS tools, the paper reports GPU speedups of 147x-509x, 243x-1269x, and 332x-2185x over CPU computation using Pandas across NVIDIA A100, H100, and H200 GPUs.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of high-performance, end-to-end workload completion using open-source tools, emphasizing significant speedup on GPUs compared to CPU computational methods.

Abstract: The HPEC Graph Challenge is a collection of benchmarks representing complex
workloads that test the hardware and software components of HPC systems, which
traditional benchmarks, such as LINPACK, do not. The first benchmark, Subgraph
Isomorphism, focused on several compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. The
most recent of the challenges, the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,
represents a shift in direction, as it represents a longer end-to-end workload
that requires many more software components, including, but not limited to,
data I/O, data structures for representing graph data, and a wide range of
functions for data preparation and network analysis. A notable feature of this
new graph challenge is the use of GraphBLAS to represent the computational
aspects of the problem statement. In this paper, we show an alternative
interpretation of the GraphBLAS formulations using the language of data
science. With this formulation, we show that the new graph challenge can be
implemented using off-the-shelf ETL tools available in open-source, enterprise
software such as NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem. Using off-the-shelf software,
RAPIDS cuDF and cupy, we enable significant software acceleration without
requiring any specific HPC code and show speedups, over the same code running
with Pandas on the CPU, of 147x-509x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, 243x-1269X for an
NVIDIA H100 GPU, and 332X-2185X for an NVIDIA H200 GPU.

*John Augustine,Soumyottam Chatterjee,Valerie King,Manish Kumar,Shachar Meir,David Peleg*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper studies distributed data retrieval in asynchronous networks, addressing faults and minimizing query complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the distributed data retrieval problem to asynchronous peer-to-peer communication networks.

Method: Propose deterministic solutions for crash faults and analyze query complexity for Byzantine failures.

Result: Demonstrates query-optimal resilience to crash faults, extends lower bounds for Byzantine failures, and presents near-optimal solutions for certain cases.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into distributed data retrieval in asynchronous systems, particularly for fault tolerance.

Abstract: The distributedData Retrieval (DR) model consists of $k$ peers connected by a
complete peer-to-peer communication network, and a trusted external data source
that stores an array $\textbf{X}$ of $n$ bits ($n \gg k$). Up to $\beta k$ of
the peers might fail in any execution (for $\beta \in [0, 1)$). Peers can
obtain the information either by inexpensive messages passed among themselves
or through expensive queries to the source array $\textbf{X}$. In the DR model,
we focus on designing protocols that minimize the number of queries performed
by any nonfaulty peer (a measure referred to as query complexity) while
maximizing the resilience parameter $\beta$.
  The Download problem requires each nonfaulty peer to correctly learn the
entire array $\textbf{X}$. Earlier work on this problem focused on synchronous
communication networks and established several deterministic and randomized
upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to extend the study of
distributed data retrieval to asynchronous communication networks. We address
the Download problem under both the Byzantine and crash failure models. We
present query-optimal deterministic solutions in an asynchronous model that can
tolerate any fixed fraction $\beta<1$ of crash faults. In the Byzantine failure
model, it is known that deterministic protocols incur a query complexity of
$\Omega(n)$ per peer, even under synchrony. We extend this lower bound to
randomized protocols in the asynchronous model for $\beta \geq 1/2$, and
further show that for $\beta < 1/2$, a randomized protocol exists with
near-optimal query complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to address the Download problem in asynchronous communication networks.

*Avisek Sharma,Satakshi Ghosh,Buddhadeb Sau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm for autonomous robots to achieve gathering in a circle under $\\pi$-visibility with finite communication ability, non-rigid movement, and a fully asynchronous scheduler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gathering robots under limited visibility poses challenges, especially when visibility conditions inhibit typical algorithms. The paper aims to solve the gathering problem for robots with constrained communication and movement under minimal visibility parameters.

Method: The authors devised an algorithm specifically tailored for robots operating under $\\pi$-visibility with finite communication capability ($\\mathcal{FCOM$) and non-rigid movement in a fully asynchronous environment.

Result: The proposed algorithm successfully enables gathering for robots under challenging conditions ($\pi$-visibility, asynchronous scheduling, and non-rigid movement), overcoming prior limitations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that effective solutions for robot gathering can be achieved under $\\pi$-visibility and non-rigid movement by leveraging finite communication capabilities in fully asynchronous settings.

Abstract: This work addresses the gathering problem for a set of autonomous, anonymous,
and homogeneous robots with limited visibility operating in a continuous
circle. The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a
rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise
direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots
on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna
\textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is
impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$
visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$
visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is
removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a
gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory
($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.
  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be
done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous
scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one
point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots
had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite
communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$). In this work the robot movement is
non-rigid and the robots work under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the computational challenges of simulating scenarios in systems with burnout variables by introducing uncertainty relaxation algorithms for efficient parallel processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual analysis in systems with burnout variables, like online advertising, is computationally demanding due to sequential trajectory processing and scalability issues.

Method: The paper proposes algorithms leveraging 'uncertainty relaxation,' improving parallel computation for counterfactual estimation in such systems.

Result: The introduced algorithms enhance scalability by enabling efficient parallel computation for systems influenced by burnout variables.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a significant advancement for large-scale systems analysis by addressing counterfactual estimation challenges through scalable computation.

Abstract: We consider large-scale systems influenced by burnout variables - state
variables that start active, shape dynamics, and irreversibly deactivate once
certain conditions are met. Simulating what-if scenarios in such systems is
computationally demanding, as alternative trajectories often require sequential
processing, which does not scale very well. This challenge arises in settings
like online advertising, because of campaigns budgets, complicating
counterfactual analysis despite rich data availability. We introduce a new type
of algorithms based on what we refer to as uncertainty relaxation, that enables
efficient parallel computation, significantly improving scalability for
counterfactual estimation in systems with burnout variables.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LowDiff, a framework for efficient frequent checkpointing using compressed gradients as differential checkpoints to reduce cost, optimize batch writes, and dynamically tune checkpoint frequency for distributed training systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing checkpointing methods in distributed training of large deep-learning models, which incur high costs and degrade performance due to frequent checkpointing.

Method: LowDiff reuses compressed gradients as differential checkpoints, optimizes their storage writes, dynamically tunes checkpointing frequency and batching size, incorporates layer-wise gradient management, and uses asynchronous persistence strategies.

Result: LowDiff achieves high-frequency checkpointing performance (up to per iteration) with minimal runtime overhead (less than 3.1%) across various workloads.

Conclusion: LowDiff significantly improves the efficiency of checkpointing in distributed training systems, making frequent checkpointing viable without substantial performance degradation.

Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures,
so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies
focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it
generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading
training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to
reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application
to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework
that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints
to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write
optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also
dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to
maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient
reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence
strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression.
Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing
frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\% runtime overhead.

*Serafino Cicerone,Alessia Di Fonso,Gabriele Di Stefano,Alfredo Navarra*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of unlimited computational power on synchronous robots in the OBLOT model, introducing an optimal resolution algorithm for tasks requiring minimal moves and rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The OBLOT model's constraints make designing distributed algorithms for mobile robots particularly challenging, prompting investigation into how unlimited computational power affects performance.

Method: The paper analyzes the OBLOT model under scenarios where synchronous robots operate on finite graphs. It leverages theoretical computation to introduce a resolution algorithm optimizing moves and rounds.

Result: The study demonstrates that unlimited computational power significantly improves the efficiency of synchronous robots, enabling them to execute tasks with minimal moves and rounds.

Conclusion: Unlimited computational power can be a transformative factor within the OBLOT model, allowing robots to achieve tasks more effectively while adhering to design constraints.

Abstract: The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics.
It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are
anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their
only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,
i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of
distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous
research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished
within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed
computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is
neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the
number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove
that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited
computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,
by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to
a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and
rounds.

*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel class of optimisers for neural networks leveraging Riemannian metrics to improve training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimisers like SGD, Adam, and AdamW may not fully utilize geometric insights from loss landscape embedding, motivating the exploration of alternative methods.

Method: The proposed optimisers utilize the Riemannian metric from loss landscape visualizations for training and apply modifications to existing preconditioning methods.

Result: Experimental results show improvements in low-dimensional settings and slight enhancements over state-of-the-art methods for neural network training.

Conclusion: These optimisers exhibit both empirical effectiveness and theoretical advantages such as dynamic learning rate adjustment and compatibility with existing preconditioning techniques.

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT is a foundational AI model for EHRs that supports feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation with strong performance and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing AI models for EHRs focus on narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their versatility and real-world application.

Method: CEHR-GPT uses a novel time-token-based learning framework to encode patients' timelines and supports three integrated capabilities: feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation.

Result: CEHR-GPT achieves high performance across tasks, effectively generalizes to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning, and eliminates the need for task-specific retraining.

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT offers a versatile architecture that facilitates rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome analysis, showcasing the potential to transform EHR-based AI applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the close relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of the Common Cause (PCC), applying these concepts to gray-scale image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to leverage the relationship between NMF and PCC to improve estimation stability, address NMF nonidentifiability problems, and apply these methods to practical applications like clustering and denoising.

Method: The paper uses datasets of gray-scale images as probability models, applying NMF and PCC reciprocally to explore their interplay. The approach includes robust rank estimation for NMF and approximate implementation of PCC using NMF.

Result: The study demonstrates that the rank estimation using PCC is stable against weak noise, leading to robust NMF features. It resolves the nonidentifiability issue in NMF and supports practical applications such as clustering and data denoising.

Conclusion: The integration of NMF and PCC offers theoretical and practical insights. It stabilizes NMF rank estimation, improves feature robustness, and provides new methods for clustering and denoising gray-scale image data.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedDeCAB, a semi-decentralized client selection method for federated learning that addresses client availability constraints, enhancing model performance and reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address challenges in federated learning caused by client heterogeneity, energy limitations, sparse data availability, and dynamic client involvement, which hamper global model convergence and fair participation.

Method: The authors propose FedDeCAB, a semi-decentralized method that applies probabilistic rankings for selecting available clients. It enables partial parameter sharing from neighboring clients when a client disconnects, improving both offline model optimization and communication efficiency.

Result: FedDeCAB's performance was validated through experiments on large-scale real-world datasets (taxi and vessel trajectories). It demonstrated effectiveness under heterogeneous data, limited communication, and dynamic client presence.

Conclusion: FedDeCAB enhances federated learning by addressing client availability issues through innovative client selection and neighbor-based parameter sharing, ensuring robust operation in challenging real-world IoT environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

TL;DR: The paper presents a geometry-aware deep learning framework employing local layer-wise training to enhance robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing training accuracy and adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Method: It introduces a geometry-aware framework with layer-wise local training to improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, supported by an energy model with Hebbian coupling.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved manifold smoothness, adversarial robustness against both white and black box attacks, and reduced representation interference.

Conclusion: This approach advances the alignment of biological and artificial intelligence and facilitates learning without substantial interference with existing knowledge.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

### [177] [SharedRep-RLHF: A Shared Representation Approach to RLHF with Diverse Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03672)
*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies fairness issues in existing RLHF approaches and introduces a novel framework, SharedRep-RLHF, which learns shared traits to improve fairness across sub-populations while significantly boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fairness issue in RLHF models that only represent dominant populations and lack representation of sub-populations, particularly in scenarios where the minimum-reward group is a minority.

Method: The authors propose SharedRep-RLHF, a framework that shifts from group-specific reward models to learning shared traits in cross-group annotations, which improves the representation of diverse sub-populations in reinforcement learning.

Result: SharedRep-RLHF demonstrates a significant improvement over MaxMin-RLHF by up to 20% in win rate across various natural language tasks, proving its capability to better represent minority opinions.

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF mitigates biases in reinforcement learning models by focusing on shared traits across groups, ensuring fairness while also improving task performance, making it a superior choice to the state-of-the-art approach.

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Motivation: Address challenges of efficiency loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission in supply chains.

Method: Using economic theories (Transaction Cost and Information Asymmetry) with machine learning methods (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost, reinforcement learning) to build multidimensional analysis and FSCM models.

Result: Achieved 30% increase in inventory turnover, 18%-22% decrease in SME financing costs, over 95% order fulfillment rate, and high forecasting/credit assessment accuracy.

Conclusion: The SCM-FSCM model minimizes costs, eases financing issues, and promotes supply chain quality enhancements.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Motivation: To understand and improve how gradient dynamics affect stability and generalization in deep neural networks, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and observed behaviors.

Method: The study tracks the variance and standard deviation of gradients across layers and proposes a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization technique aligning gradient scaling with natural evolution.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN show that the gradient normalization method stabilizes optimization and maintains or improves test accuracy.

Conclusion: Directly monitoring gradient dynamics is crucial for optimizing deep networks, and the proposed method successfully enhances performance and bridges theory with practice in training behaviors.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

TL;DR: This paper extends sparse autoencoders to infinite-dimensional function spaces for better mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators, focusing on unifying representations and comparing their dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the representational properties of neural operators and address the problem of unifying representations in neural models, especially in the context of scientific computing.

Method: The paper extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted and infinite-dimensional function spaces to study their inference and training dynamics in neural operators.

Result: Lifting and operator modules were shown to provide beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster and more robust recovery of smooth concepts and robust inference across varying resolutions.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of neural operators and demonstrates that lifting improves their representation, enabling better interpretability and inference dynamics.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational inefficiencies of traditional kernel methods for Bayesian inference on graph structures with large numbers of nodes.

Result: Bayesian inference with GRFs achieves $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels, enabling speedup and memory optimization.

Conclusion: GRFs provide the computational and memory improvements necessary for effective Bayesian optimization on graphs with millions of nodes.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently

processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), an approach leveraging multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs) in fog/edge infrastructures to address modality and task heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The M3T foundation models, like GPT-4, processing diverse tasks and modalities, increasingly demand leveraging geo-distributed and heterogeneous data in fog/edge network settings.

Method: HF-FMs align M3T FM modular structures (e.g., modality encoders, MoEs) with hierarchical fog/edge infrastructures, incorporating device-to-device communications for localized cooperation and training.

Result: Prototyped HF-FMs in wireless network settings, showcasing their potential and releasing open-source code for advancing exploration.

Conclusion: The HF-FMs framework introduces novel capabilities for handling modality/task heterogeneities in hierarchical networks, offering research directions and practical implementation resources.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR improves visualization and geometric preservation for noisy, high-dimensional data using a curvature-enhanced metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNE algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often fail to preserve data geometry and cluster structure in noisy, high-dimensional datasets.

Method: EmbedOR introduces a curvature-enhanced distance metric that improves visualization, emphasizing cluster structure and extending tSNE consistency.

Result: EmbedOR showed stronger geometry-preservation and clustering performance, avoiding data fragmentation as compared to UMAP and tSNE during experiments.

Conclusion: EmbedOR offers better visualization, less data fragmentation, and provides a tool for annotating visualizations to deepen insights into data geometry.

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

### [185] [Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)
*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Online Testing Problem (OTP), where optimal testing policies are needed under scenarios of missing data. This complicates the learning process, leading to higher regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how missing data impacts the exploration-exploitation trade-off when designing efficient policies for sequential online testing problems.

Method: The authors developed two algorithms: an Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) algorithm for handling general OTP scenarios with missing data and an Iterative-Elimination algorithm for a variant with more manageable reward structures. These are theoretically analyzed for regret bounds.

Result: They prove the fundamental difficulty of OTP with a minimax regret of $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ and show that their ETC algorithm matches this bound. For a special case, their Iterative-Elimination algorithm achieves a better $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Conclusion: The paper sheds light on the challenges of learning under missing data in the OTP and provides new algorithms and theoretical bounds, helping guide future development of testing policies.

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a differentiable range-partition entropy estimator for deep learning tasks, showcasing its ability to enhance efficiency and performance in computational geometry and Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt the range-partition entropy concept for use in deep learning, enabling algorithms to exploit input 'sortedness' while improving efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors developed a differentiable approximation of range-partition entropy, introduced EntropyNet for data restructuring, and extended entropy regularization to Transformer attention.

Result: The method resulted in up to 4.1x runtime speedups in geometry tasks and 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity in deep learning tasks, with negligible error and verified effectiveness through theoretical bounds and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Differentiable range-partition entropy is a practical approach for adaptive learning, boosting computational efficiency, and achieving structured representation, proving both theoretical appeal and real-world utility.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

Motivation: To address the failures of machine learning methods in socially and high-risk sensitive areas, such as medical diagnosis, and to explore their underlying causes.

Method: The paper introduces and investigates two overlooked problems—'no fair lunch' and 'subgroup separability'—that contribute to these failures. Existing fair representation learning methods are analyzed to identify their limitations in addressing these problems.

Result: Causal and statistical structures behind machine learning failures are detailed, and shortfalls in current methods are exposed. The authors propose potential future directions to address these issues.

Conclusion: The paper underscores that safe deployment of machine learning in sensitive contexts requires tackling the highlighted challenges. It calls for new strategies beyond existing fair representation learning methods to ensure reliable performance across diverse groups.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal

problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research introduces an optimal spatial training data strategy for SatML, addressing the common issue of sparse labeled data with limited budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SatML faces challenges due to scarce and spatially clustered labeled data, particularly impacting scalability for global applications in agriculture, ecology, and human development.

Method: They formulated a problem of optimizing spatial training data under budget constraints, coupled with novel methods for diverse scenarios, evaluated across continents and tasks.

Result: The study showcased significant gains in SatML performance through optimized sample collection while identifying scenarios where it is most effective.

Conclusion: The introduced problem formulation and methods can generalize across SatML applications, with immediate benefits demonstrated for agricultural monitoring in Togo.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural

### [190] [Parking Availability Prediction via Fusing Multi-Source Data with A Self-Supervised Learning Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Inverted Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04362)
*Yin Huang,Yongqi Dong,Youhua Tang,Li Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents an advanced model (SST-iTransformer) leveraging clustering and multi-source traffic data for improved parking availability predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban parking challenges driven by increased car ownership necessitate precise availability predictions to enhance urban planning and management.

Method: SST-iTransformer utilizes K-means clustering for parking zones and incorporates a dual-branch attention mechanism in upgraded iTransformer for enhanced spatio-temporal representation learning.

Result: Experiments on Chengdu data show SST-iTransformer significantly outperforms baseline models, with lowest MSE/MAE and highlights the importance of ride-hailing and historical/correlated data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses spatio-temporal prediction challenges, highlighting the necessity of spatial dependency modeling and integrating multi-source traffic data for parking management.

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven method based on Diffusion Maps for approximating functions on smooth manifolds, improving scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in high-dimensional function approximation on smooth manifolds efficiently and effectively.

Method: The approach combines diffusion geometry, the heat equation, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator, employing SVD for dimensionality reduction and an online updating mechanism for new data incorporation.

Result: Numerical experiments, including sparse CT reconstruction applications, showcased superior accuracy and efficiency compared to neural networks and interpolation.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology offers an advanced, scalable, and accurate framework for real-valued function approximation on manifolds.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework where a generative 'Attacker' agent creates challenging scenarios, driving a cooperative 'Defender' team to learn strategies, enabling self-scaling complex training environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed complexity and implicit biases in hand-crafted training environments for developing robust, generalizable agents.

Method: Introduced a co-evolutionary system with generative Attacker agents that create increasingly difficult challenges for cooperative Defender agents, creating a self-scaling curriculum through their interactions.

Result: Demonstrated the emergence of complex behaviors such as flanking, shielding, coordinated focus-fire, and spreading tactics within the agents.

Conclusion: Adversarial co-evolution can effectively generate instrumental world models that enhance agents' strategic depth and robustness through dynamic, scalable training environments.

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores low-rank structures in reward matrices to improve sample complexity in sparse-reward reinforcement learning, presenting Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) as a key method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient learning in sparse-reward reinforcement learning settings remains a challenge, particularly in terms of minimizing sample complexity in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors propose Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC), integrating matrix completion theory with reinforcement learning using policy-dependent sampling and providing robust guarantees despite approximate low-rank structures.

Result: Across 100 sampled domains, PAMC identified exploitable structures in over half and improved sample efficiency between 1.6x and 2.1x compared to baseline methods, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Structural reward learning via PAMC showcases its potential as an effective framework for improving sparse-reward reinforcement learning, with applications in robotics, healthcare, and various safety-critical fields.

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

### [194] [Online time series prediction using feature adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03810)
*Xiannan Huang,Shuhan Qiu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADAPT-Z, a novel method to enhance time series forecasting under distribution shifts, especially in online learning settings with delayed feedback, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in time series forecasting caused by distribution shifts, particularly in online scenarios requiring continuous adaptation.

Method: ADAPT-Z is proposed, leveraging an adapter module that uses both current feature representations and historical gradient information for robust updates despite delayed feedback in forecasting.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal ADAPT-Z's consistent outperformance of baseline models and state-of-the-art online learning methods across various datasets.

Conclusion: ADAPT-Z advances time series forecasting in online settings, effectively handling distribution shifts and delayed feedback, with openly available code for broader application.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

### [195] [Machine Learning for LiDAR-Based Indoor Surface Classification in Intelligent Wireless Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03813)
*Parth Ashokbhai Shiroya,Swarnagowri Shashidhar,Amod Ashtekar,Krishna Aindrila Kar,Rafaela Lomboy,Dalton Davis,Mohammed E. Eltayeb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops a LiDAR-based machine learning framework to classify indoor surfaces based on their scattering properties, ultimately enhancing mmWave and sub-THz network reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz signals are highly susceptible to blockage, requiring innovative strategies to ensure reliable connectivity in indoor environments. By understanding surface scattering behavior, network reliability can improve.

Method: LiDAR was used to collect optical reflectivity data from indoor materials. Patch-level features—including elevation angle, scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio—were extracted and fed into machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural networks for surface classification.

Result: Ensemble tree-based models outperformed other classifiers in accuracy and robustness, successfully predicting scattering properties of surfaces based on LiDAR-derived features.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively maps scattering-induced features of surfaces, paving the way for adaptive technologies in future mmWave and sub-THz networks.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

analyzing relative feature colinearity and unsupervised dimensionality
reduction through autoencoders, followed by a dense network. The features are
related to traffic accident data and the target is to classify accident

when classifying accident severity using the proposed deep neural network.

*Lucas Lopes Felipe,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Daniel Sadoc Menasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper offers a game-theoretic reinterpretation of the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for community detection, emphasizing efficiency, robustness, and accuracy in network partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Community detection is critical for analyzing complex network structures, and the authors aim to improve its efficiency and reliability through a game-theoretic approach.

Method: The authors redefine CPM as a potential hedonic game, localizing its global Hamiltonian into individual utility functions. They introduce optimization criteria based on robustness and propose stability measures controlled by resolution parameters.

Result: Better-response dynamics ensure pseudo-polynomial convergence to an equilibrium partition. Experiments show robust partitions enhance accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities using the Leiden algorithm.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic reinterpretation of CPM improves computational efficiency, stability robustness, and accuracy in practical community detection scenarios.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

*Kimia Ehsani,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bird's-eye view (BEV) injection framework to enhance large language models for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) tasks, showing improved performance for link quality predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of incorporating spatial understanding in multimodal large language models for better V2I communication link quality prediction using comprehensive and diverse vehicle sensor data.

Method: A bird's-eye view (BEV) framework is proposed, combining sensing data from multiple vehicles to generate spatial contexts that are then integrated with large language models. A co-simulation system using CARLA and MATLAB simulates multimodal data to train and evaluate the models.

Result: The BEV injection framework improved link prediction tasks' accuracy by up to 13.9%, with further improvements in adverse conditions (e.g., rain and nighttime), showing up to 32.7% enhancement compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The introduced BEV methodology enhances V2I communication prediction tasks, outperforms the ego-only input baseline, and demonstrates robustness under challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

*Yang Chen,Xiao Lin,Bo Yan,Libo Zhang,Jiamou Liu,Neset Özkan Tan,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method for mean field games (MFGs), addressing the limitations of existing methods in handling heterogeneous agent objectives through a deep latent variable model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods in MFGs struggle with handling heterogeneous and unknown agent objectives, which limits their practical applications.

Method: The authors propose a deep latent variable mean field game (MFG) model combined with an IRL method to infer rewards for heterogeneous, structurally similar tasks without prior context knowledge.

Result: Experiments on simulated scenarios and a real-world taxi-ride pricing problem show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IRL techniques in MFGs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework expands the capabilities of IRL in MFGs, enabling effective handling of demonstrations with heterogeneous objectives.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric to optimize data augmentation (DA) for low-precision models in quantization-aware knowledge distillation (KD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works on KD and QAT focus on improving accuracy using loss functions and propagation techniques but neglect the role of input transformations such as DA.

Method: The authors propose evaluating DAs through a novel metric based on Contextual Mutual Information and alignment with ground truth predictions.

Result: The metric enables automatic ranking and selection of DAs, achieving better performance in QAT and KD with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed metric improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD results across diverse architectures and datasets while maintaining compatibility with existing algorithms.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MillGNN, a graph neural network-based model, to effectively capture multi-scale lead-lag dependencies, improving multi-variate time series forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS forecasting methods fail to account for hierarchical lead-lag dependencies across multiple grouping scales in complex systems.

Method: MillGNN incorporates: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning module for evolving dependencies, and (2) a hierarchical message passing framework to model intra- and inter-scale lead-lag effects comprehensively.

Result: Experimental results on 11 datasets show MillGNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art methods in both short-term and long-term MTS forecasting.

Conclusion: MillGNN demonstrates significant advancements in modeling and leveraging hierarchical lead-lag dependencies for enhanced MTS forecasting accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The developed model serves as a reliable and accurate non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting coronary heart disease, highlighting its potential impact on clinical practice.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequence- and graph-based methods fall short in capturing the hierarchical organization of protein structures, limiting their utility for understanding structure-function relationships.

Method: The authors propose the Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) to represent proteins hierarchically and the Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet) that applies SE(3)-equivariant message passing for improved multi-scale structural pattern recognition.

Result: TCPNet outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks across four protein representation learning tasks, excelling in fold classification by capturing secondary structure arrangements.

Conclusion: The hierarchical topological features introduced by Topotein are critical for advancing protein representation learning and improving understanding of protein structures.

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Method: The researchers employed Marabou, a formal verification tool, to assess the local robustness of neural network models. This involves analyzing how much input perturbation a model can tolerate before its outputs become unstable.

Result: Using Marabou quantifies the robustness of the neural networks, providing insights into how they perform under uncertain conditions and ensuring performance reliability.

Conclusion: Integrating formal verification techniques like Marabou enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models in satellite fault detection systems, enabling earlier and more dependable fault identification.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper outlines a framework for integrating clinical experiential knowledge into ML models for healthcare, focusing on prostate cancer prediction, proving alignment is feasible without harming model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misalignment between modern ML models' behavior and clinical experiential learning, specifically underspecification issues in healthcare AI applications.

Method: A case study on prostate cancer outcome prediction using clinical knowledge via constraints in ML models, coupled with feedback-driven alignment approaches validated in randomized experiments with clinicians.

Result: Aligning ML models with clinical knowledge improved consistency without performance degradation; feedback-based alignment proved successful in enhancing clinical interpretability.

Conclusion: Integrating clinical experiential learning into ML models resolves behavioral inconsistencies, enriches interpretability, and maintains predictive accuracy, showcasing promising applicability in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedQuad, a novel federated learning method designed to address data heterogeneity by optimizing inter-class and intra-class variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generalization of global models in federated learning faces challenges from data heterogeneity, especially under limited data and class imbalance.

Method: FedQuad explicitly minimizes intra-class variance while maximizing inter-class variance across clients using a metric-learning-based strategy to disentangle client data in shared feature space.

Result: FedQuad demonstrates superior performance against existing methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets across diverse data distributions and numerous clients.

Conclusion: FedQuad effectively improves representational learning in federated settings, with a detailed analysis of metric-learning strategies in both supervised and federated paradigms.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

*Amirmohammad Farzaneh,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SP-CCI, a method leveraging synthetic data to improve prediction intervals for counterfactual outcomes, addressing the conservativeness issue in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for counterfactual prediction intervals often yield overly conservative results, especially under treatment imbalance, due to limited counterfactual samples.

Method: The proposed SP-CCI combines synthetic counterfactual data generation, conformal calibration via RCPS, and a debiasing step with PPI to ensure tighter prediction intervals with valid coverage guarantees.

Result: SP-CCI consistently produces narrower prediction intervals compared to traditional methods while maintaining theoretical coverage guarantees. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its efficacy across various datasets.

Conclusion: SP-CCI enhances the reliability and efficiency of counterfactual inference by reducing overly conservative intervals and upholding theoretical validity.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

*Ainhize Barrainkua,Giovanni De Toni,Jose Antonio Lozano,Novi Quadrianto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Algorithmic recourse ensures actionable steps for individuals to reverse negative decisions from classifiers. Concerns exist about fairness in this process. The paper proposes a social burden framework and a method (MISOB), achieving fairness in recourse and classification without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging legislation necessitates actionable pathways for individuals to challenge negative decisions, emphasizing the demand for fairness in both classification and the recourse process.

Method: The researchers establish a new fairness framework centered on social burden and develop MISOB, a practical algorithm designed to handle real-world conditions by reducing unfairness in algorithmic recourse.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that MISOB enhances fairness by minimizing social burden for all demographic groups while maintaining classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper bridges fairness in classification and algorithmic recourse using the proposed framework, offering a scalable and fair recourse mechanism suitable for sensitive applications.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TAGAL, a set of methods for generating synthetic tabular data using an agentic, feedback-driven workflow with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluated for various datasets and ML use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance machine learning tasks, particularly classification, by generating high-quality synthetic tabular data without requiring further training of LLMs, while also incorporating external knowledge.

Method: The authors utilize an agentic workflow that leverages LLMs to iteratively generate tabular data with feedback loops to refine its quality. This is done without retraining the LLMs, making the method efficient and adaptable.

Result: The results indicate that TAGAL performs on par with state-of-the-art methods that require LLM training and outperforms other non-training approaches. It successfully maintains data quality and utility for ML model training and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: TAGAL demonstrates the potential of agentic LLM workflows for synthetic data generation, achieving competitive performance and opening new research directions for training-free methods leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

### [211] [Attention as an Adaptive Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154)
*Peter Racioppo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), an attention mechanism integrating a learnable linear dynamics model into its computation. The formulation is derived using principles of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the computation of attention weights by introducing a mechanism grounded in stochastic dynamics, which enhances robustness and precision compared to traditional dot-product attention.

Method: The authors model the input sequence as observations of a linear SDE, implement pairwise uncertainty propagation via a differential Lyapunov equation, and derive attention as the maximum likelihood solution of the system.

Result: AFA computes attention weights as reweighted pairwise precisions while ensuring computational and memory complexity comparable to standard attention mechanisms. A simplified variant matches the efficiency of standard attention.

Conclusion: AFA bridges stochastic modeling and attention computation, offering a more robust attention method that transitions to standard dot-product attention under specific conditions.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

TL;DR: The paper explores the transfer learning ability of self-supervised speech models like HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS for bioacoustic tasks, showing competitive performance and robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised speech models have excelled in speech processing but their utility for non-speech, specifically bioacoustic data, has not been adequately explored.

Method: The authors examine the latent representations generated by speech models for bioacoustic data, employing linear probing for analysis and experimenting with architectures accounting for time-wise information and noise effects.

Result: The investigated models provide rich representations of animal sounds, achieve competitive results compared to bioacoustic-specific models, and highlight noise-robust training benefits.

Conclusion: Speech-based self-supervised learning offers an efficient framework for advancing bioacoustic research by leveraging transferable and noise-robust representations.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates membership inference attacks (MIAs) against time series forecasting models, introducing two novel attacks and benchmarking them to assess privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexamined vulnerability of time series forecasting models to membership inference attacks and establish privacy benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose two new MIAs: an adaptation of the multivariate LiRA for time-series forecasting and a novel Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. These are evaluated on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets under record- and user-level threat models, targeting LSTM and N-HiTS architectures.

Result: Results indicate vulnerability of forecasting models, with user-level attacks achieving perfect detection in some cases. The proposed methods outperform existing approaches, setting new benchmarks for privacy risk in time series forecasting.

Conclusion: Time series forecasting models exhibit significant privacy risks, particularly under certain conditions like longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, necessitating further research into mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

*Razi Hasson,Reuven Guetta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), provides theoretical insights into Dirichlet energy reduction, extends findings to spectral polynomial filters, and suggests practical ways to alleviate the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-smoothing in GNNs results in loss of node distinguishing power in deep architectures, making it critical to analyze and address this limitation.

Method: The authors extend theoretical results regarding the Dirichlet energy decrease under mild spectral conditions, including Leaky-ReLU activations, and provide experimental observations on techniques to mitigate over-smoothing.

Result: They show exponential reduction of Dirichlet energy with depth in GNNs under certain conditions, validate their findings with spectral polynomial filters, and demonstrate practical edge deletion and weight amplification to counter over-smoothing.

Conclusion: Under specific conditions, Dirichlet energy reduction is inevitable in deeper GNNs, but practical methods like edge deletion and weight amplification offer relief from over-smoothing.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Set Block Decoding (SBD), a method to accelerate language model inference by combining next token prediction and masked token prediction, allowing for faster generation without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high computational and memory costs of language model inference, particularly during the decoding stage.

Method: The authors propose SBD, which samples multiple future tokens in parallel by integrating next token prediction and masked token prediction within a single architecture. This method utilizes advanced solvers and requires fine-tuning existing models, with no need for architectural changes or extra hyperparameters.

Result: Experiments with fine-tuned Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B models show that SBD achieves a 3-5x reduction in forward passes required for generation while maintaining performance comparable to traditional next token prediction training.

Conclusion: SBD provides a flexible and efficient solution for accelerating language model decoding, enabling significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy or requiring extensive modifications.

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZooCast leverages the complementary strengths of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) to improve zero-shot forecasting by dynamically assembling and selecting optimal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of how to optimally utilize the complementary forecasting strengths of diverse Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) without task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: The proposed ZooCast framework uses the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm to map TSFMs into a unified representation space, enabling dynamic and efficient similarity-based forecasting model selection.

Result: ZooCast demonstrates superior performance in zero-shot forecasting on the GIFT-Eval benchmark, showcasing its ability to integrate models seamlessly and improve accuracy in real-world scenarios with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: ZooCast realizes an efficient and expandable approach to leveraging multiple TSFMs through dynamic model selection, paving the way for enhanced forecasting capabilities and adaptability.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes supervised metrics (precision and recall) to evaluate the relationship modeling phase in Dimensionality Reduction (DR), making the DR process faster and more reliable for visualizing expected cluster structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding why expected cluster structures are missing in DR projections and to simplify the time-consuming hyperparameter tuning process.

Method: The paper introduces two supervised metrics, precision and recall, to evaluate how well modeled relationships in DR align with expected cluster structures using label sets.

Result: The approach is validated using t-SNE and UMAP, showcasing its utility in hyperparameter tuning, artifact detection, and ensuring expected structures are captured in relationships.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics improve the reliability and efficiency of the DR process, aiding in better understanding and visualization of high-dimensional data's cluster structures.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the theoretical long-range dependency capabilities of various sequence models, including State-Space Models (SSM) and transformers. It proposes a new method to combine the computational efficiency of SSM with the flexibility of transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of theoretical investigation into the long-range dependency modeling capability of modern sequence models, hindering systematic improvement.

Method: The paper defines long-range dependency mathematically using hidden state derivative analysis relative to past inputs, and contrasts SSM and transformer capabilities. A new formulation for hidden state updates in SSM is introduced with stability proofs under Gaussian input data.

Result: SSM exhibits exponential decay in modeling long-range dependency, similar to RNNs, while transformers showcase more flexible capability due to the attention mechanism.

Conclusion: Combining SSM efficiency with transformer flexibility, the proposed hidden state update formulation provides a theoretically stable improvement towards balancing computation and modeling power.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

*Qifeng Tan,Shusen Yang,Xuebin Ren,Yikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework that systematically optimizes layer-wise noise injection strategies for differentially private deep learning, proposing a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-Consistent allocation method for better privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms are heuristic and lack a systematic connection between noise allocation and privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Method: The paper develops an analytical framework that connects layer-wise noise injection strategies with implicit optimization objectives and proposes a new SNR-Consistent noise allocation strategy.

Result: The proposed SNR-Consistent method achieves better signal preservation, efficient usage of privacy budgets, and outperforms current methods in both centralized and federated learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework provides diagnostic insights into existing methods and guides the design of more adaptive noise injection schemes, improving the privacy-utility tradeoffs in differentially private deep learning.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets created using deep learning models can preserve data privacy and fidelity, enabling broader research applications and overcoming significant data-sharing challenges in heart failure studies.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

*Idan Shenfeld,Jyothish Pari,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) preserves prior knowledge better than supervised fine-tuning (SFT), attributed to RL's preference for minimal KL-divergence solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the differences in knowledge retention and task adaptation between reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for fine-tuning models.

Method: Analysis of the KL-divergence shift during fine-tuning, theoretical justification for on-policy RL updates, and experimental validation using large language and robotic foundation models.

Result: RL minimizes KL-divergence to the base model during fine-tuning, preserving prior knowledge better than SFT, which can deviate arbitrarily from the base distribution.

Conclusion: RL is implicitly biased towards solutions that maintain prior knowledge, a principle termed 'RL's Razor,' highlighting its advantage over SFT in preserving original model capabilities during task adaptation.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

### [222] [An Interactive Framework for Finding the Optimal Trade-off in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04290)
*Yaohong Yang,Aki Rehn,Sammie Katt,Antti Honkela,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the privacy-performance trade-off in differential privacy (DP) by reformulating the problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) task, improving efficiency in trade-off modeling and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of balancing privacy guarantees and model performance in differential privacy by leveraging a more direct method to optimize and select trade-offs.

Method: The authors derive the theoretical shape of the privacy-performance trade-off, allowing direct and efficient modeling of the Pareto front. They also introduce an interactive method for preference learning that uses hypothetical trade-off curves instead of standard pairwise comparisons.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates faster convergence to optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs with lower computational cost and user interaction across multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances efficiency in discovering and selecting optimal privacy-performance trade-offs, leveraging tailored modeling and innovative user feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

### [223] [Using causal abstractions to accelerate decision-making in complex bandit problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04296)
*Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AT-UCB, a new algorithm for causal multi-armed bandits (CMAB). It uses different abstraction levels and causal abstraction theory to improve decision-making efficiency and reduce regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a general methodology for exploiting information and computational advantages of CMABs at varying abstraction levels.

Method: The AT-UCB algorithm uses causal abstraction theory to simulate decisions at a coarse-grained CMAB level and then applies the UCB algorithm to optimize actions in the refined CMAB.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AT-UCB achieves significant reductions in cumulative regret compared to traditional UCB algorithms, both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: AT-UCB is a robust framework for leveraging abstraction levels in CMABs, reducing computational costs and improving decision-making performance.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

### [224] [Characteristic Energy Behavior Profiling of Non-Residential Buildings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04322)
*Haley Dozier,Althea Henslee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven approach to model and analyze energy usage behaviors in U.S. Army installations for improving climate resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the rising threat posed by climate change and extreme weather events to U.S. Army installations' infrastructure and emphasizes the need for enhanced resilience in energy and water resources.

Method: A behavioral model is proposed to analyze and organize energy usage data from installations. This includes predicting and clustering multimodal data from non-residential buildings using open-access datasets.

Result: The proposed model will establish energy behavior profiles to assess the impact of disruptions and create benchmarks for future energy resiliency measures.

Conclusion: Analyzing energy behavior in installations supports preparedness against vulnerabilities, enabling the Army to plan and implement effective climate resilience strategies.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

### [225] [When three experiments are better than two: Avoiding intractable correlated aleatoric uncertainty by leveraging a novel bias--variance tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04363)
*Paul Scherer,Andreas Kirsch,Jake P. Taylor-King*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces active learning strategies to minimize bias in experimental scenarios characterized by heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, proposing a cobias-covariance method for data batching and showing its superiority over existing techniques like BALD and Least Confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world experimental contexts, noise (aleatoric uncertainty) and its correlation in batching pose challenges in reducing prediction errors. There is a need for strategies that effectively minimize bias and manage uncertainty.

Method: The paper develops new active learning methods to minimize bias between experimental rounds by using a bias—variance tradeoff framework. It also introduces a cobias-covariance relationship for leveraging historical data and optimizing batch processing via eigendecomposition.

Result: The proposed cobias-covariance method for batched settings, coupled with a quadratic estimator, performs better than established techniques such as BALD and Least Confidence in managing uncertainty and prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The cobias-covariance methodology is a promising approach to actively reduce model bias and uncertainty, particularly in scenarios with batched heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, offering a substantial improvement over current methods.

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

### [226] [PagedEviction: Structured Block-wise KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04377)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Jie Ye,Xian-He Sun,Anthony Kougkas,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PagedEviction, a new KV cache pruning strategy that improves memory efficiency during LLM inference while maintaining accuracy for long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the memory bottleneck caused by KV caching as sequence length increases during LLM inference.

Method: PagedEviction uses a block-wise eviction strategy tailored for paged memory layouts, integrating seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring CUDA kernel modifications.

Result: The method improves memory usage and achieves better accuracy compared to baselines, as demonstrated on the LongBench benchmark with Llama models.

Conclusion: PagedEviction provides a practical solution for improving memory efficiency in LLMs without sacrificing accuracy in long-context tasks.

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

### [227] [Transition Models: Rethinking the Generative Learning Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04394)
*Zidong Wang,Yiyuan Zhang,Xiaoyu Yue,Xiangyu Yue,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transition Models (TiM), a novel generative framework that enables better quality and efficiency in state transitions by overcoming limitations of iterative and few-step generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models face a trade-off between high fidelity in iterative models and computational efficiency in few-step models, both limited by restrictive training objectives.

Method: They propose Transition Models (TiM), powered by a continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions for any finite time interval, allowing scalable step adjustments.

Result: Despite having fewer parameters (865M), TiM outperforms leading models like SD3.5 (8B) and FLUX.1 (12B) at all evaluated step counts and achieves exceptional resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Conclusion: TiM addresses generative quality-efficiency conflicts with a scalable generative trajectory, achieving state-of-the-art results while supporting monotonic quality improvement as computational steps increase.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

### [228] [IPA: An Information-Preserving Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398)
*Yuan Yin,Shashanka Venkataramanan,Tuan-Hung Vu,Andrei Bursuc,Matthieu Cord*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces IPA, a projection framework enhancing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods by preserving information during down-projection, improving accuracy and reducing trainable parameters compared to existing approaches like LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, like LoRA, suffer from random initialization in down-projection layers, which limits performance by neglecting valuable information during adaptation.

Method: IPA introduces a feature-aware projection mechanism that leverages principal component analysis to preserve information in the reduced hidden space during down-projection. This approach trains these projections efficiently, reducing computation and inference costs.

Result: IPA demonstrates improvement over LoRA and DoRA across language and vision benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy (1.5 points on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k) and matching full LoRA performance while requiring nearly half the trainable parameters.

Conclusion: IPA addresses the inefficiencies in parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods by preserving information in projections, leading to consistent gains in performance and resource efficiency across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

### [229] [Interpretable Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning in Mixed Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04415)
*Wenrui Li,Qinghao Zhang,Xiaowo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HCL, a framework for unsupervised clustering and causal structure learning that effectively handles heterogeneity, confounding, and observational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately model causal heterogeneity and confounding in observational data, limiting interpretability and discovery of true causal mechanisms.

Method: The HCL framework jointly infers latent clusters and causal structures using bi-directional iterative refinement and self-supervised regularization, without requiring prior knowledge like temporal or environmental labels.

Result: HCL demonstrates superior clustering and structure learning performance, successfully identifying biologically meaningful mechanisms in single-cell perturbation data.

Conclusion: HCL offers an interpretable and effective approach to uncovering heterogeneous causal patterns, addressing gaps in traditional methods and advancing scientific understanding in complex domains.

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

*Xingtai Lv,Yuxin Zuo,Youbang Sun,Hongyi Liu,Yuntian Wei,Zhekai Chen,Lixuan He,Xuekai Zhu,Kaiyan Zhang,Bingning Wang,Ning Ding,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), a unified approach to training language models that integrates reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning, showing advantages in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to unify the training strategies of reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning for language models, addressing stability and performance issues.

Method: The Unified Policy Gradient Estimator is introduced, consisting of interchangeable components to optimize different training signals. The proposed Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) algorithm dynamically selects training signals.

Result: HPT consistently outperformed strong baselines in six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites for language models of various scales and families.

Conclusion: The proposed HPT framework unifies reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating its theoretical and experimental effectiveness in improving language model training.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

### [231] [Echo State Networks as State-Space Models: A Systems Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04422)
*Pradeep Singh,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper redefines Echo State Networks (ESNs) as state-space models (SSMs), providing theoretical explanations and novel training mechanisms for better system understanding and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESNs are traditionally guided by heuristics rather than robust theoretical principles, limiting their systematic design and performance.

Method: The study reformulates ESNs as SSMs by introducing stability conditions, developing two mappings (linearization and random-feature expansions), and aligning ESNs with spectral shaping concepts using Kalman filtering and EM algorithms.

Result: The authors provide theoretical conditions (e.g., leak, spectral radius) for stability, connect ESNs to state-space and kernel methods, and improve ESN training with advanced estimation techniques (e.g., Kalman filtering).

Conclusion: The findings unify ESNs with SSMs from a systems-theoretic and kernel perspective, improving their interpretability, design, and training under structured constraints.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

TL;DR: The paper explains recent advances in tabular deep learning by linking the success of certain methods to implicit mechanisms for managing data uncertainty. It also introduces improved numerical feature embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the knowledge gap in understanding why specific tabular deep learning techniques succeed, particularly focusing on the role of data uncertainty.

Method: The authors analyze design choices like feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models, and ensembling strategies to identify their connection to managing data uncertainty.

Result: They reveal that these mechanisms are a unifying factor for recent performance improvements, and propose more effective numerical feature embeddings based on this understanding.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundational understanding of modern tabular deep learning, facilitates better methods, and identifies directions for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned LLMs as embeddings based on internal activation changes, enabling effective clustering by domain and task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in navigating and understanding finetuned LLMs due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.

Method: The proposed method, Delta Activations, measures shifts in internal activations between finetuned models and a base model, creating vector embeddings for clustering and analysis.

Result: Delta Activations enables robust clustering of finetuned models by domain and task, shows additive properties with mixed datasets, and facilitates tasks like model selection, task embedding, and model merging.

Conclusion: This approach offers a structured way to explore and reuse finetuned models in the LLM landscape, aiding the community with tools for organization and analysis.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

*Cyrus Cousins,Vijay Keswani,Vincent Conitzer,Hoda Heidari,Jana Schaich Borg,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on aligning AI models with human decision-making processes using a novel axiomatic approach to tackle current limitations in preference elicitation methods. The proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy and interpretability in modeling human decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing models that fail to capture cognitive processes involved in human decision-making, thereby improving alignment between AI models and human preferences.

Method: An axiomatic approach is used to create cognitively faithful models based on pairwise comparison and feature aggregation. This involves structuring the processing and comparison of individual features followed by aggregation using rules like Bradley-Terry.

Result: The authors showcase improved interpretability and accuracy in modeling human decision-making using their approach, particularly in an applied kidney allocation task.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides realistic, interpretable models for human decision-making that align better with cognitive processes, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and utility.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

TL;DR: ChronoGraph is a dataset designed for multivariate time series forecasting in microservice systems, featuring interconnected service nodes and incident-based anomaly labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic benchmarks for multivariate time series forecasting and anomaly detection in microservice systems.

Method: ChronoGraph integrates graph-structured data from production microservices, annotated with expert-labeled incident anomalies for evaluation.

Result: Baseline evaluations include forecasting and anomaly detection models applied to this dataset, showcasing its utility in performance pattern analysis and incident-aware assessment.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph provides a unique and realistic benchmark for studying forecasting and anomaly detection in microservice environments with graph-structured dependencies.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

*Sara Makenali,Babak Rokh,Ali Azarpeyvand*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper presents two approaches combining similarity-based filter pruning and APoT quantization to enhance Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN deployment on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to computational and memory demands. Combining pruning and quantization for greater compression is underexplored due to optimization and accuracy concerns.

Method: The paper introduces two strategies: 1) simultaneous application of pruning and quantization during training; 2) a two-step integration where pruning precedes quantization using low-bit representations.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve effective compression with minimal accuracy loss, suitable for resource-limited deployments.

Conclusion: The integration of pruning and quantization offers higher compression efficiency while preserving DNN accuracy, enhancing their usability on constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide
range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,
which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this
issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,
commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance
processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even
greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization
to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily
due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly
optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that
integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)
quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model
accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied
simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed
first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the
pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal
accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with
limited computational resources.

### [237] [When Lifetimes Liberate: A Type System for Arenas with Higher-Order Reachability Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04253)
*Siyuan He,Songlin Jia,Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper aims to offer a unifying solution for managing resources in higher-order functional languages by combining the strengths of region-based systems, ownership types, and reachability types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations in static resource management in higher-order functional languages are due to restrictions on control over lifetimes, sharing patterns, and safety guarantees.

Method: The paper introduces a two-dimensional store model (A<:) to track reachability in arenas and a specialized extension ({A}<:) to ensure lexical lifetime control, both integrated with reachability types.

Result: The proposed models enable flexible sharing and lifetime control with static safety guarantees in a higher-order language, validated through formalization and proofs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves static safety in resource management while preserving flexibility and expressiveness in higher-order functional languages, bridging gaps in existing paradigms.

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

*Quan Quan,Jiwen Xu,Runxiao Liu,Yi Ding,Jiaxing Che,Kai-Yuan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-inspired decentralized method to enable cooperative aerial transportation by robot swarms without explicit communication, proving its robustness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative aerial transportation approaches face issues with scalability, communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures. A transformative solution is needed, particularly for logistics and disaster response scenarios.

Method: The approach uses a decentralized dissipative force model inspired by table-leg mechanics, where each robot autonomously adjusts its position based on local neighbors and the payload without explicit communication. The method is rigorously tested through simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: The proposed system shows improved tracking errors (20%, 68%, 55.5%, 21.9%) compared to existing methods in various challenging scenarios. Real-world experiments with six drones exhibit a 94% success rate under conditions like robot failures, payload variation, and outdoor winds.

Conclusion: This novel decentralized, physics-inspired framework integrates mechanical stability principles with swarm intelligence, offering scalability and robustness for heterogeneous aerial systems to handle complex tasks in constrained environments.

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-making framework for two robots working together to transport objects, featuring a neural network-based model that identifies grasp configurations suitable for collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable, collaborative grasp planning between two robots in constrained environments prompted the development of a system for identifying feasible grasp configurations.

Method: The framework employs a Conditional Embedding (CE) model built from two neural networks, trained with supervised learning and negative sampling, using diverse environmental and object datasets.

Result: The model successfully identified feasible grasp configurations in simulation tests across varied environments and objects, and was validated in physical robotic experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for decision-making in cooperative grasping tasks, offering generalizability and practicality in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for generating diverse, accurate future trajectories for autonomous vehicle planning while addressing challenges like fidelity, efficiency, and control.

Method: Presents a two-stage normalization pipeline for trajectory scaling and stable PCA latent space normalization, with denoising in low-dimensional latent space using an MLP, combined with scene context provided by a Transformer-based StateEncoder.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset with minADE of 0.25 and insights from an ablation study emphasizing multi-step sparse routes over single endpoint goals.

Conclusion: Efficient Virtuoso effectively balances fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control, advancing trajectory planning and mimicking human driving behavior nuances.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a convex hull-based real-time dynamic buoyancy modeling system for AUV simulations, aimed at overcoming the lack of native buoyancy in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the absence of a native buoyancy system in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, which constrains high-fidelity underwater AUV simulations.

Method: The proposed method dynamically calculates the AUV's submerged volume based on mesh geometry and its intersection with the water level using a convex hull approach, incorporating a cross-sectional area extension for efficient buoyant force computations.

Result: The method was tested on a custom AUV design, showing real-time performance and scalability, adapting to orientation, depth, and wave fluctuations.

Conclusion: This approach enhances simulation fidelity for underwater robotics by enabling accurate, scalable, real-time buoyancy modeling without relying on precomputed hydrodynamic models.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic architectures, primarily serial mechanisms, limit the potential of robotic intelligence, necessitating new frameworks for innovative robotic designs.

Method: The paper introduces INGRID, a framework that integrates reciprocal screw theory with kinematic synthesis, decomposing design into four steps: constraint analysis, joint generation, chain construction, and mechanism design.

Result: INGRID successfully generates novel parallel mechanisms with unique kinematic configurations and validates it through three case studies, facilitating task-specific robot designs.

Conclusion: This approach bridges mechanism theory with AI, allowing non-experts to create customized robotic systems, removing hardware constraints, and potentially advancing embodied AI development.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study addresses garment manipulation challenges and introduces a dual-arm visuotactile framework combining dense visual correspondence confidence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate garments in crumpled and suspended states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Garments pose manipulation challenges due to complex material dynamics and frequent self-occlusion, requiring advanced techniques that move beyond flattening or reliance on visible features.

Method: The dual-arm system integrates a dense visual correspondence model trained on simulated data using a distributional loss, alongside a visuotactile grasp affordance network that is self-supervised by tactile feedback for grasp validation.

Result: The framework adapts folding strategies based on uncertainty and enables manipulation of occluded garments, demonstrating capability in folding and hanging tasks; the descriptors provide reusable intermediate representations for broader applications such as human video demonstrations.

Conclusion: This system offers scalable, generalizable garment manipulation, smoothing the way for broader planning modalities in robotics through its reusable representations and confidence-aware strategies.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal pose estimator for a wall-climbing robot using EKF, UKF, and data from wheel odometry, visual odometry, and IMU to handle the limitations of traditional localization methods in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate pose estimation for wall-climbing mobile robots in environments where traditional and GPS-based localization methods fail due to geometric, material, and signal issues.

Method: Proposed a pose estimator combining EKF, UKF, and multimodal sensor data; conducted systematic calibrations via nonlinear optimization methods (Levenberg-Marquardt) and stochastic methods (Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm).

Result: Validated calibration methods and pose estimators through experiments on a mobile wall-climbing robot, showing effectiveness in such challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal pose estimator provides reliable pose information for wall-climbing robots, crucial for performing measurements and maintenance in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Conclusion: This framework aids in testing and refining cloud-robot deployments under practical conditions.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive

integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional perception-planning lacks flexibility and end-to-end VLA systems struggle with failure recovery.

Method: A supervisor predicts action failures and generates corrections, aided by a similarity-guided fusion module for refining actions, requiring minimal manual labeling.

Result: FPC-VLA demonstrates superior performance in simulations and real-world robot tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: FPC-VLA enhances task success rates and generalizes well, proving its reliability and practical utility for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM), a fine-tuning algorithm to improve Vision-Language-Action models in robotic tasks using offline reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of Vision-Language-Action models in handling complex robotic tasks due to the sole reliance on imitation learning.

Method: Proposes a new offline RL-based post-training objective and introduces an adaptive scaling factor to balance RL advantages with variance control in flow matching models.

Result: ARFM demonstrates improved generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning in both simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ARFM effectively enhances Vision-Language-Action models, providing a stable and efficient approach for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Method: Modification of Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL) with a calibrated Q-value action selection module and using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) as the RL policy.

Result: The DRLR framework demonstrated efficiency in handling bootstrapping errors and overfitting across various state-action dimensions and tasks. Simulation and real-world tests on robotics tasks, including on a real wheel loader, validated its robustness and efficacy.

Conclusion: DRLR framework enhances reinforcement learning in robotics by optimizing exploration and decision-making and has been shown to work effectively in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

### [252] [Keypoint-based Diffusion for Robotic Motion Planning on the NICOL Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04076)
*Lennart Clasmeier,Jan-Gerrit Habekost,Connor Gäde,Philipp Allgeuer,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning that achieves fast results by learning from numerical planners' datasets, significantly reducing runtime compared to standard approaches while maintaining high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical planning methods for robotic motion planning often require substantial runtime, which motivates the exploration of deep learning to provide faster solutions.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion-based model that predicts keypoint-based joint sequences using point cloud embeddings as input, learned from datasets generated by numerical planners.

Result: The model, despite initial challenges in conditioning on point cloud embeddings, was refined through dataset improvement. It outperformed numerical planners in runtime efficiency and achieved a 90% success rate for collision-free test solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates that learning-based approaches can substantially reduce runtime and remain effective, making them advantageous over traditional numerical planners.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

### [253] [Object-Reconstruction-Aware Whole-body Control of Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04094)
*Fatih Dursun,Bruno Vilhena Adorno,Simon Watson,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computationally efficient method for object reconstruction tasks using a focus point approach that avoids the need for sampling-based path planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object reconstruction approaches are computationally expensive due to evaluating numerous candidate views along paths, necessitating faster methods.

Method: The authors focus on identifying a single "focus point" in the most unknown region, integrating visibility constraints into whole-body control of a mobile manipulator.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests on diverse objects show comparable performance in object coverage but demonstrate a ninefold increase in efficiency versus sampling-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves computational efficiency without sacrificing reconstruction performance, making it practical for robotics applications.

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

*Ke Wu,Yuhao Wang,Kevin Henry,Cesare Stefanini,Gang Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LASEM, a model for cable-driven continuum robots that is computationally efficient and accounts for various physical factors, validated via simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion planning and control of continuum robots, inspired by biological structures like octopus arms, require accurate yet efficient modeling due to their complex morphology.

Method: The LASEM framework models actuation potential energy in actuation space using nonlinear physics principles, enabling unified kinematic and static solutions with minimized computational cost.

Result: LASEM demonstrated accuracy through numerical simulations and offered a method for inverse kinematics while addressing robot discretization issues with numerical optimizations.

Conclusion: LASEM is a versatile and computationally efficient modeling framework for continuum robots, proving its potential for real-time and complex applications without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

TL;DR: OVGrasp is a framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp assistance combining vision-language models, multimodal cues, and wearable technology, achieving superior grasping performance in open environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective grasp assistance in unstructured environments for individuals with motor impairments, given the diverse and unpredictable object categories and user intentions.

Method: Integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, voice commands, a vision-language foundation model, and multimodal decision-making for zero-shot object detection and flexible user intent inference in multi-object scenarios.

Result: Achieved an 87.00% grasping ability score (GAS) in systematic evaluations across 15 objects and three grasp types with ten participants, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: OVGrasp effectively improves grasp assistance and kinematic alignment with natural hand motion, demonstrating robust multimodal interaction and adaptability to open environments.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces perioperation and DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton that sensorizes human manipulation to enable better robotic data collection and skill transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve robotic dexterity by designing a paradigm and device to generate high-quality human manipulation data transfers to robots, overcoming limitations in traditional teleoperation.

Method: DEXOP is a passive hand exoskeleton designed to mechanically connect human fingers to robot fingers, providing proprioceptive feedback and enabling pose mirroring. It collects sensory data and facilitates natural human demonstrations for robots.

Result: DEXOP demonstrated success across various dexterous tasks by producing high-quality data. Policies trained with DEXOP data showed enhanced task performance efficiency compared to teleoperation.

Conclusion: DEXOP offers an effective solution for scaling robotic data collection and improving robot dexterity, outperforming teleoperation in speed and accuracy for dexterous tasks.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

TL;DR: EMMA is a framework that trains mobile manipulation robots using human and static robot data instead of expensive teleoperated robot data, showing effective generalization and scalability in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of teleoperated mobile robot data for imitation learning is expensive and limits scalability.

Method: The method co-trains policies using human full-body motion data together with static robot data, avoiding teleoperation data requirements.

Result: EMMA achieves comparable or better task success than baselines trained with teleoperation data and generalizes effectively to new spatial configurations and scenes.

Conclusion: Utilizing scalable human data can surpass traditional teleoperation-dependent approaches, offering new possibilities for robotic learning.

Abstract: Scaling mobile manipulation imitation learning is bottlenecked by expensive
mobile robot teleoperation. We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA),
an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile
manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To
accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot
data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates
comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data
(Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task
success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations
and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the
hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in
real-world environments. Details of this project can be found at

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the sources and uses of datasets in requirements engineering research for mobile apps, finding a strong reliance on app store data and a bias toward certain RE activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the state-of-the-art of datasets used in requirements engineering for mobile apps and identify gaps in current research practices.

Method: A systematic mapping study following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al., analyzing 43 papers.

Result: Google Play and Apple App Store provide over 90% of datasets, with requirements elicitation and analysis being the most studied RE activities.

Conclusion: The study highlights growth in dataset usage since 2012, potential bias due to over-reliance on app store data, the need for diversified data sources, and calls for research to explore RE activities beyond elicitation and analysis.

Abstract: [Background] Research on requirements engineering (RE) for mobile apps
employs datasets formed by app users, developers or vendors. However, little is
known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on
datasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]
Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Random Forest-based automated error diagnosis framework to address an ICCAD 2025 contest challenge, achieving 91.36% accuracy for debugging APB transaction errors in VCD files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional verification and debugging in SoC design are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone, especially when diagnosing transaction errors in large VCD files.

Method: A hierarchical Random Forest-based framework with four binary classifiers is used to automate error diagnosis by prioritizing address-related faults before data errors, improving efficiency.

Result: The framework achieves an overall 91.36% accuracy, excelling in precision and recall for address errors, and showing strong performance for data errors.

Conclusion: Hierarchical machine learning proves effective and competitive as an automated debugging tool in EDA, with the method securing first place in the beta stage of ICCAD 2025 Contest Problem D.

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful
automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

### [260] [Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668)
*Matt Rau,Chris Brown,John Edwards*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first algorithm for tracking parse tree nodes through time, enabling high-level analysis of student programming behavior at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of analyzing programming process data caused by the inability to automatically track high-level code representations through time.

Method: The authors developed two algorithms to track parse tree nodes and construct tree representations for unparseable states, applied to keystroke data from a CS1 course.

Result: Findings include newly observable statistics such as code deletion rates, commented code restoration, and non-indicative struggle behavior from code navigation.

Conclusion: Tracking parse trees through time enables new insights into student programming behaviors and practices over time, paving the way for improved structural and syntactic analysis at scale.

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

*Rodrigo Oliveira Zacarias,Rodrigo Pereira dos Santos,Patricia Lago*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SECO-TransDX, a conceptual model exploring transparency's role in software ecosystems from a developer experience perspective, aiming to enhance DX and foster trust and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored role of transparency in shaping Developer Experience (DX) within Software Ecosystems (SECO), despite transparency being acknowledged as essential for trust, fairness, and engagement.

Method: The authors developed SECO-TransDX, a conceptual model created using prior research and refined through a Delphi study involving experts from academia and industry.

Result: The SECO-TransDX model identifies 63 interrelated factors that impact transparency in SECO, spanning technical, social, and organizational dimensions.

Conclusion: The model serves as a framework for researchers to study transparency's impact on DX and for practitioners to design more trustworthy and developer-centered SECO platforms, fostering long-term engagement.

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

### [262] [VulRTex: A Reasoning-Guided Approach to Identify Vulnerabilities from Rich-Text Issue Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03875)
*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Guowei Yang,Lin Shi,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes VulRTex, a new reasoning-guided approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify vulnerability-related issue reports (IRs) in open-source software with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual identification of vulnerability-related IRs in OSS is time-consuming and leaves systems exposed to potential exploits due to time gaps. Existing automatic methods focus only on textual information and miss deeper analysis of rich-text information in IRs.

Method: The proposed approach, VulRTex, leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs to create a Vulnerability Reasoning Database based on historical IRs. Relevant cases are retrieved to guide LLMs in reasoning and analyzing rich-text information in target IRs.

Result: VulRTex outperforms prior methods with improved metrics (+11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, +10.5% Macro-F1) and operates at half the time cost compared to reasoning baselines. In application, it identified 30 vulnerabilities in GitHub's 2024 IRs, 11 of which were assigned CVE-IDs.

Conclusion: VulRTex proves effective and practical for quickly and accurately identifying vulnerability-related IRs, providing a significant step forward in OSS security and addressing prior limitations in automatic identification methods.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies tools identifying software versions affected by vulnerabilities, revealing fundamental limitations and advocating new approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite tools available for identifying vulnerable software versions, their real-world effectiveness is poorly understood due to limited evaluations.

Method: A benchmark of 1,128 real vulnerabilities was curated to evaluate 12 tools, analyzing effectiveness, false positives/negatives, patch sensitivities, and ensemble strategies.

Result: No tool performed above 45% accuracy, with ensemble strategies improving results up to 10.1%, emphasizing major challenges like heuristic dependence and rigid matching logic.

Conclusion: Existing methods are inadequate for accurately identifying affected software versions, requiring new paradigms and actionable insights for future tool development.

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained

### [264] [Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896)
*Zushuai Zhang,Elliott Wen,Ewan Tempero*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how code smell interactions in software can increase dependencies between modules, using an analysis of 116 Java systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how code smell interactions can affect software dependencies, complicating maintenance.

Method: Conducted a dependency analysis comparing smell and non-smell code interactions in 116 Java systems.

Result: Code smell interactions result in increased total dependencies, with examples showing significant magnification in dependency numbers.

Conclusion: Developers should focus on resolving interacting code smells as they exacerbate dependency issues.

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

*Yuvraj Agrawal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Auth Shim, a proxy service designed to bridge security integration gaps in open-source software (OSS) by enabling compatibility with enterprise single sign-on (SSO) protocols like SAML and OIDC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of native support for enterprise security protocols in standalone OSS tools, which creates a barrier for secure integration within enterprise settings.

Method: The Auth Shim is presented as an external proxy service that translates communications between an enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) and the target application's session management system using a secure administrative API provided by the application.

Result: A case study at Adobe demonstrates successful integration of an OSS BI tool with Okta SAML using the Auth Shim, enabling automated IAM group-based RBAC and eliminating manual user provisioning.

Conclusion: The Auth Shim offers a reusable, secure, and cost-effective solution for integrating standalone OSS tools with enterprise SSO systems, facilitating secure adoption of open-source tools in enterprises.

Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but
standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,
creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to
embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.

*Jingjing Liu,Zeming Liu,Zihao Cheng,Mengliang He,Xiaoming Shi,Yuhang Guo,Xiangrong Zhu,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RepoDebug, a repository-level debugging dataset supporting multiple tasks, languages, and error types for comprehensive LLM evaluation. Current LLMs struggle with repository-level debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing debugging datasets, which focus mostly on function-level code repair and lack diversity in tasks, languages, and error types, leading to an incomplete understanding of repository-level debugging challenges.

Method: The authors propose RepoDebug, a new dataset comprising 22 error subtypes, supporting 8 programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. They evaluate the debugging capabilities of 10 large language models against the dataset.

Result: The evaluation shows that even the best-performing model, Claude 3.5 Sonnect, struggles with repository-level debugging, highlighting the difficulty of the task.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are inadequate for repository-level debugging, and RepoDebug can serve as a benchmark to drive advancements in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyVul, a benchmark suite for Python-package vulnerabilities, with 1,157 verified vulnerabilities and high label accuracy, aiding the evaluation of detection tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a comprehensive and precise vulnerability benchmark for Python packages due to an increase in vulnerability reports and the underexplored effectiveness of detection tools.

Method: Developed PyVul, a vulnerability benchmark suite with annotations and data cleansing using LLM assistance for accuracy. Also analyzed vulnerability distribution in Python packages.

Result: PyVul achieved 100% commit-level and 94% function-level label accuracy. Multi-lingual packages were found more susceptible to vulnerabilities, and evaluation of existing tools highlighted gaps in their capabilities.

Conclusion: PyVul sets a new standard for Python-package vulnerability benchmarks and emphasizes the need for improved detection tools, particularly for multi-lingual vulnerabilities.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaaSGuard, a unified security framework for serverless computing in open-source environments, enhancing DevSecOps with lightweight checks integrated throughout the lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive and integrated security strategies for serverless computing in open-source environments, specifically the unique security challenges posed by serverless functions like ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability.

Method: The paper proposes FaaSGuard, a DevSecOps pipeline embedding lightweight, fail-closed security checks across all DevSecOps lifecycle stages, validated through a case study on 20 real-world serverless functions.

Result: FaaSGuard achieved 95% precision and 91% recall in detecting and preventing critical vulnerabilities, effectively addressing threats like injection attacks, without disrupting conventional CI/CD workflows.

Conclusion: FaaSGuard demonstrates the potential for significantly enhancing security in serverless environments, addressing critical vulnerabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing development practices.

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in locating suitable blood donors during emergencies, ensuring timely access to blood.

Method: The platform uses web technologies (PHP, Laravel, etc.) and system design tools (diagrams) to build an efficient, centralized, user-friendly blood donation system.

Result: The developed platform facilitates faster donor registration, blood request processing, and communication, minimizing delays in emergencies.

Conclusion: The system improves timely blood accessibility, enhancing efficiency in emergency blood donation services.

Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable
donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper
presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register
their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and
availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,
and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

*Timothee Robert,MohammadAli Shaeri,Mahsa Shoaran*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiND, a novel model for decoding bimanual hand movements from neural recordings, outperforming six state-of-the-art models and showing robustness to session variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of decoding bimanual movements for BCIs, complicated by overlapping neural patterns and nonlinear interlimb interactions.

Method: The authors developed BiND, a two-stage model combining motion classification (unimanual/bimanual) with GRU-based decoders that predict continuous hand velocities. It uses trial-relative time indexing for enhanced predictions.

Result: BiND achieved a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 for unimanual and 0.69 for bimanual predictions, outperforming all six benchmarked models by up to 4% in session-variability scenarios.

Conclusion: BiND demonstrates the importance of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling for accurate bimanual movement decoding, suggesting its viability for improving BCIs.

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the implementation and computational feasibility of Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent Networks (HORNs) in analog-electronic hardware. Using a digital twin model, a trained HORN was transferred to the analog equivalent, revealing potential for energy-efficient analog systems but highlighting challenges due to precision mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of implementing oscillatory recurrent networks, specifically HORNs, in analog-electronic hardware for energy-efficient computation mimicking brain-inspired dynamics.

Method: The study used a digital twin approach to train a four-node HORN for sequential MNIST classification, transferred parameters to an analog implementation, and compared results using custom error metrics to evaluate dynamics and classification performance.

Result: The analog system replicated the dynamics of the digital model in most tests, but classification agreement between analog and digital predictions was low (28.39%) due to hardware precision differences. Retraining the readout layer on the analog system restored classification performance to match the digital counterpart.

Conclusion: Analog electrical circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks, preserving computational information content. This provides a pathway for creating energy-efficient analog systems for brain-inspired computational tasks.

Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent
Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed,
and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet,
while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor
dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in
analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far
are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in
analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of
the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node
HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained
parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error
metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the
dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall
well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on
the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement
with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch
is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the
floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform
classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a
re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to
that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the
analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic
circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation,
providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit
brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.

*Mauricio Girardi-Schappo,Leonard Maler,André Longtin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores how adaptive recurrent neuronal networks can encode information efficiently, especially for weak stimuli, through a dual-coding scheme of spatial spike patterns and firing rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of reliably encoding weak stimuli in recurrent neuronal populations, which traditional firing rate methods struggle with.

Method: The authors investigate the behavior of a stochastic recurrent excitable network around its critical point, leveraging single-cell threshold adaptation to optimize coding schemes.

Result: They reveal a synergistic dual-coding mechanism that enhances mutual information for both weak and strong inputs by combining rate and variance coding. Adaptation ensures robustness near critical points.

Conclusion: Threshold adaptation is critical for robust and diverse encoding of weak signals in neural networks, highlighting the importance of near-critical adaptive dynamics in biological and artificial systems.

Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception
and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are
often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes
unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be
transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial
coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic
recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme,
enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance
coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs,
thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust
across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of
internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are
linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits
(~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at
criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable
encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a
fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual
coding in biological and artificial neural networks.

*Niclas Dern,Lennart Redl,Sebastian Pfister,Marcel Kollovieh,David Lüdke,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), enabling efficient training of continuous normalizing flows for Boltzmann distributions using only energy evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from unnormalized high-dimensional target distributions such as Boltzmann distributions is computationally challenging, leading to the need for improved techniques to address this issue.

Method: The paper presents the EWFM training objective that reformulates flow matching via importance sampling and introduces two algorithms: iterative EWFM (iEWFM) for progressive proposal refinement and annealed EWFM (aEWFM) with temperature annealing for complex energy landscapes.

Result: The proposed methods achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art energy-only techniques on benchmark systems, reducing energy evaluations by up to three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed EWFM methods are efficient alternatives for modeling Boltzmann distributions, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and sample quality.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions
$\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many
scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex,
high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern
generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of
samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy
evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of
advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown
promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce
Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling
continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy
function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via
importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal
distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative
EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training,
and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature
annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including
challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate
sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while
requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of understanding correlations between node-level features and network structures, which is crucial for various applications.

Method: Proposed four methods: two using linear models with latent variables and two using canonical correlation analysis to avoid linear modeling assumptions.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are provided for accuracy using a low-rank latent space model, demonstrated on simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The methods are computationally efficient and make fewer assumptions, outperforming prior techniques for network dependency testing.

Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features.
In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates
are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel
methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model
relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive
network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation
analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear
modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods
when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space
model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be
high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer
modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We
demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated
and real-world data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for enhancing diffusion models used in synthetic data generation by incorporating compressed sensing to improve efficiency and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for faster and more efficient diffusion model inference, particularly in applications involving synthetic data generation.

Method: The method involves compressing data into a latent space, training a diffusion model in this reduced space, and applying a compressed sensing algorithm to enhance efficiency and promote faster convergence under data sparsity assumptions.

Result: The approach achieves faster convergence and determines an optimal latent space dimension under suitable sparsity conditions. Numerical experiments validate the method across various datasets, including images and financial time series.

Conclusion: Integrating compressed sensing with diffusion models proves effective, offering a scalable solution for efficient synthetic data generation with potential broad applications.

Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an effective method for both simulation and inference in inverse problems using a generative model that covers sampling from the likelihood and posterior distributions.

Method: Combining upper and lower triangular normalizing flows into a single invertible mapping for conditional sampling, and proposing a training loss for this generative model.

Result: Demonstrates the utility and properties of the proposed approach numerically through stylized examples.

Conclusion: The new invertible generative modeling approach is viable for conditional sampling in Bayesian frameworks, offering properties useful for simulation and inference.

Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computationally efficient framework for solving stochastic matching problems using the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) model, achieving regret bounds while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of minimizing regret in stochastic matching tasks, a computationally expensive NP-hard problem, driven by the need to optimize cumulative rewards in agent-arm assignments.

Method: They propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates, enabling lower computational costs ($O(1)$ amortized) while maintaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces computational costs, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in solving the matching problem.

Conclusion: The study provides an efficient solution to the stochastic matching problem using the MNL model, balancing computational cost and regret performance effectively.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching
based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents
on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm
stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown
preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize
regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all
agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based
on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur
a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we
propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates,
thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per
round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Motivation: PDE problems are computationally intensive to solve accurately at scale, and existing methods lack efficiency and flexibility. This paper addresses the challenges by exploring neural network-based surrogate solvers.

Method: The authors propose a subdomain neural operator model compatible with flexible boundary conditions, coupled with iterative multilevel domain decomposition techniques to enhance scalability and accuracy for solving PDEs, focusing on Maxwell’s equations.

Result: The model successfully solves large-scale PDE problems with varying conditions (e.g., size, resolution, wavelength). Additionally, it enables accurate inverse design of nanophotonic devices for multi-wavelength scenarios.

Conclusion: Neural network surrogates, integrated with iterative algorithms, promise to provide scalable and precise solutions for complex, large-scale PDE challenges across different fields.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate

### [280] [Towards understanding Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow -- Analysis of Generalized Bilinear Kernels for Gaussian target distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04008)
*Viktor Stein,Wuchen Li*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), a faster variant of Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with added momentum and regularization, showing improved sampling efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in Bayesian neural network tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGD is effective for sampling without requiring score estimation but can be slow in high-dimensional cases, motivating the development of a faster sampling algorithm leveraging its advantages.

Method: ASVGD employs accelerated gradient flow inspired by Nesterov's momentum-based method, with deterministic particle updates and Wasserstein regularization to stabilize computations.

Result: The proposed ASVGD achieves optimal convergence rates under specific conditions, and numerical experiments show its effectiveness across varied target distributions, outperforming SVGD and other methods, especially in Bayesian neural networks.

Conclusion: ASVGD offers a significant speedup and superior sampling performance compared to SVGD and contributes innovative momentum-based regularization techniques to sampling algorithms.

Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and
non-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as
in Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other
particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the
gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to
score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient
high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce
accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric
space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a
momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of
particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we
also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the
conference version \cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target
distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an
optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by
analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.
Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on
the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel
functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target
distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other
popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian
neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of
log-likelihood and total iteration times.

*Iman Seyedi,Antonio Candelieri,Enza Messina,Francesco Archetti*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores the evolution of the assignment problem, integrates optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) theory, and proposes methods like GW-MultiInit for solving complex assignments efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the understanding and application of assignment problems, especially Quadratic Assignment Problems (QAP), by leveraging advanced optimal transport methods.

Method: The study connects classical linear assignment methods to OT theory, introduces GW distances for diverse metric-measure spaces, and proposes computational strategies like GW-MultiInit and entropic approximations.

Result: GW-MultiInit consistently achieves high performance on complex QAP instances by finding near-optimal solutions, with flexible variations balancing accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: The work bridges theoretical and computational advancements in OT for solving practical matching problems, offering guidelines for QAP-related tasks in fields like machine learning and logistics.

Abstract: The assignment problem, a cornerstone of operations research, seeks an
optimal one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks to minimize total cost.
This work traces its evolution from classical formulations and algorithms to
modern optimal transport (OT) theory, positioning the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP) and related structural matching tasks within this framework. We
connect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,
Kantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where
source and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW
variant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address
QAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances
and cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint
correspondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed
multi-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting
stuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and
fused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that
GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales
efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while
parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy
and runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational
insights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and
other real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and
logistics.

*Daniil Medyakov,Gleb Molodtsov,Grigoriy Evseev,Egor Petrov,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical convergence for shuffling-based methods in variational inequalities, validating their efficiency through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of theoretical guarantees for shuffling-based approaches in solving variational inequalities, a strategy used instead of independent data sampling.

Method: The authors established theoretical bounds and convergence rates for shuffling methods, followed by experimental validation on benchmark problems.

Result: The experiments demonstrated faster convergence rates of shuffling methods compared to traditional independent sampling techniques in diverse problems.

Conclusion: Shuffling-based methods are shown to be theoretically sound and practically faster for solving variational inequality problems, expanding the methodological toolkit for researchers.

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine
learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these
problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an
alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves
permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal
consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical
guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We
address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for
shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and
convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class
of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on
diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster
convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.

TL;DR: The paper leverages machine learning and genomic data to predict antimicrobial resistance trends, identifying resistance determinants and forecasting healthcare impacts of Campylobacter infections in the UK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing public health and economic problems caused by antimicrobial resistance, especially linked to Campylobacter species.

Method: The paper applies machine learning through Random Forest and time-series forecasting models, utilizing genomic, epidemiological, and economic data to detect AMR patterns and trends.

Result: The research achieved 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes using machine learning models, and forecasts increasing campylobacteriosis cases and economic burdens by 2050.

Conclusion: The findings highlight urgent attention needed to curb AMR trends, emphasizing the utility of machine learning models for predictive analysis and policy implications.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic
challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.
This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data
from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity
(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by
the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns
in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK
from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance
determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We
investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene
for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with
bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%
accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,
SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially
exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden
projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced
Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by
incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend
modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing
fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.

*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The LibriQuote dataset is proposed as a large-scale English corpus for improving expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems, featuring a diverse set of expressive and non-expressive speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in expressive speech synthesis caused by insufficient representation of expressive speech in large-scale corpora.

Method: The dataset comprises 12.7K hours of non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours of primarily expressive speech from character quotations, supplemented with contextual and pseudo-label information. A test set is provided for zero-shot TTS benchmarking.

Result: Fine-tuning a baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improved the intelligibility of synthesized speech, but current systems still fail to match the expressiveness and naturalness of ground-truth utterances.

Conclusion: LibriQuote advances the field of expressive TTS by offering a diverse dataset and benchmarking tools, highlighting gaps in current systems' ability to synthesize expressive and natural speech.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of deriving the linear response of random dynamical systems in general settings, overcoming limitations of hyperbolicity and specific noise models.

Method: The authors derive a divergence-kernel formula applicable to a broad class of stochastic systems, pass it to continuous-time limits, and develop a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm.

Result: They formulate an efficient pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm and propose a forward-only diffusion generative model, showcasing its performance in simple cases.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical advances in computing the linear response of stochastic systems and practical applications in generative modeling.

Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response
(parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random
dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula
works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it
does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm
for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative
model and test on simple problems.

*Atikkhan Faridkhan Nilgar,Manuel Dietrich,Kristof Van Laerhoven*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores users' privacy perceptions of social robots in well-being coaching and highlights the importance of user control in data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns as social robots increasingly support well-being coaching, where they handle sensitive user information.

Method: An online study with 200 participants to examine the impact of transparency, user control, and robot behavior (proactive vs. reactive) on privacy perceptions.

Result: Users rated perceived privacy and trust higher when they had explicit control over the robot's use of their information, while transparency and proactivity had minimal impact.

Conclusion: Providing user control is key to addressing privacy concerns in interactions with social robots; transparency and proactivity alone are inadequate.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.

Result: Findings demonstrated the pedagogical value of gaze analytics when supported by intuitive tools like familiar visualizations and narrative scaffolds. Conversational agents reduced cognitive barriers in data interpretation.

Conclusion: Integrating eye-tracking analytics in educational technology is feasible and beneficial with proper design, and conversational agents can enhance interpretation and utility for classroom applications.

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large
language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by
enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biometric user model using deep metric similarity learning to detect behavioral changes caused by XR avatars. The model outperforms traditional methods in sensitivity and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and measure behavioral changes in XR environments triggered by avatar bodily affordances, such as the Proteus effect.

Method: Development of a biometric user model using deep metric similarity learning, tested against motion analysis and post-exposure questionnaires in a within-subject study.

Result: The proposed model effectively identified user behavioral changes due to avatar height variations, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The model allows unobtrusive, scalable, user-specific, and real-time behavioral analysis in XR, improving over typical subjective methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HumAIne-chatbot, a conversational AI that personalizes interactions using a unique user profiling framework, showing improved outcomes in personalized settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems lack personalized interactions and adaptive dialogue management, limiting user satisfaction and engagement.

Method: The chatbot employs pre-training with GPT-generated personas and refines user models during live interactions through reinforcement learning, using both implicit signals and explicit feedback to adjust its dialogue policy.

Result: Controlled experiments with synthetic personas demonstrated consistent improvements in user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement in personalized scenarios.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and sets the groundwork for real-world applications of personalized conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-based, massively-parallel implementation of the Cosserat rod model for real-time simulation, achieving significant speed-ups over CPU computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable fast and accurate computer simulations of Cosserat rods for applications such as threads, surgical instruments, and catheters, requiring real-time interactive rates.

Method: The authors implemented massively-parallel versions of the Cosserat rod model using GPU programming. They employed CUDA Scalable Programming with inter-block synchronization to reduce computation time and maximize GPU utilization, simulating multiple time-steps in a single kernel launch.

Result: The GPU implementation achieved significant performance improvements: a 40x speed-up for the original extensible model and a 15.11x average speed-up for the inextensible version, enabling real-time simulation at 0.5-1kHz in certain applications.

Conclusion: The novel GPU-based implementation of Cosserat rod models has successfully enabled efficient, high-performance simulations, particularly for real-time cardiovascular applications such as catheter and guidewire simulation.

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

TL;DR: The paper introduces LuxDiT, a method using video diffusion transformers to estimate high-dynamic-range (HDR) lighting from images or videos, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of estimating scene lighting from limited visual input, which is constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps in current methods.

Method: LuxDiT fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer using a synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions and employs a low-rank adaptation strategy with real-world HDR panoramas to enhance semantic alignment.

Result: The proposed approach achieves both accurate lighting predictions and realistic details in HDR environment maps, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: LuxDiT is effective in recovering HDR lighting information from indirect visual cues, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data for improved generalization.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ContraGS is a novel method enabling training on compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, achieving significant memory reduction and faster processing with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the high GPU memory requirements and slower latencies associated with training and rendering 3D Gaussian Splatting models, especially as higher quality necessitates large model sizes.

Method: ContraGS employs codebooks for compact storage of Gaussian parameter vectors, combined with Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to overcome challenges in training compressed representations.

Result: ContraGS reduces peak memory usage during training (on average by 3.49X), accelerates training and rendering processes (by 1.36X and 1.88X respectively on average), while maintaining close-to-state-of-the-art quality.

Conclusion: ContraGS successfully demonstrates the feasibility of training on compressed 3DGS representations, making it a practical solution for high-quality scene modeling with reduced resource requirements and enhanced efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),

### [296] [TensoIS: A Step Towards Feed-Forward Tensorial Inverse Subsurface Scattering for Perlin Distributed Heterogeneous Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04047)
*Ashish Tiwari,Satyam Bhardwaj,Yash Bachwana,Parag Sarvoday Sahu,T. M. Feroz Ali,Bhargava Chintalapati,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces "HeteroSynth," a synthetic dataset and proposes "Tensorial Inverse Scattering" (TensoIS), a learning-based framework to estimate heterogeneous scattering parameters using sparse image observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating scattering parameters in heterogeneous media are limited and often assume homogeneity. The lack of well-defined distributions for real-world heterogeneous scattering motivates exploration of procedural noise models like Perlin noise.

Method: The authors create a synthetic dataset (HeteroSynth) with scattering parameters modeled on Fractal Perlin noise and introduce TensoIS, a feed-forward framework that uses learnable low-rank tensor components for estimating scattering volumes from sparse multi-view images.

Result: TensoIS effectively estimates scattering parameters for unseen heterogeneous shapes, realistic smoke and cloud simulations, and some real-world samples. Its performance establishes viability for handling inverse scattering tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of Perlin noise distributions for modeling heterogeneous scattering and presents TensoIS as a promising feed-forward solution for estimation challenges in computer graphics and optical scattering.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

### [297] [SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04058)
*Lei Zhong,Yi Yang,Changjian Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents SMooGPT, a method for stylized motion generation using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), facilitating interpretability, novel styles, and fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of existing methods, such as low interpretability, limited generalization to new styles, and dataset biases. The aim is to produce novel motions that respect both motion content and desired styles using a more effective and interpretable approach.

Method: The approach introduces a reasoning-composition-generation paradigm by leveraging body-part-centric natural language descriptions as intermediary representations. It utilizes SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, to reason, compose, and generate stylized motions.

Result: The proposed framework achieves higher interpretability, enables fine-grained motion control, resolves content-style conflicts, and generalizes well to unseen styles. Experimental studies also validate the approach's effectiveness, particularly in text-driven scenarios.

Conclusion: The work highlights the effectiveness of using body-part text space and LLMs for achieving compositional and generalizable stylized motion generation, solving key challenges faced by prior methods.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

*Dongliang Cao,Guoxing Sun,Marc Habermann,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining person-specific rendering and pre-trained diffusion models to generate photorealistic, dynamic human avatars with realistic pose-based deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for creating human avatars either achieve photorealism but are limited to specific individuals or produce generic avatars with lower quality and static animations. The authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The approach employs a two-stage pipeline: optimizing person-specific UNets to capture pose-dependent deformations, followed by training a hyper diffusion model for generating network weights in rendering dynamic avatars.

Result: Experiments on a large dataset show that the approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dynamic human avatar generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines photorealistic rendering and cross-identity generalization capabilities, achieving superior performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

*Aviad Levis,Nhan Luong,Richard Teague,Katherine. L. Bouman,Marcelo Barraza-Alfaro,Kevin Flaherty*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cutting-edge computational framework leveraging neural fields and radiative transfer solvers to extract detailed structures of protoplanetary disks using ALMA data, revealing insights overlooked by conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protoplanetary disks are central to planet formation, but their evolution remains difficult to characterize due to limitations in 3D modeling at high resolutions.

Method: The authors developed RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable radiative transfer solver integrated with physics-constrained neural fields and differentiable rendering.

Result: RadJAX achieved up to 10,000x speedup over traditional methods, allowing detailed reconstructions of disk structures such as the narrowing and flattening of CO emission surfaces previously unnoticed.

Conclusion: This framework sets a new benchmark for investigating protoplanetary disks and contributes to a deeper understanding of their 3D structures and evolution.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture
features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational
framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable
rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature
missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting
complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary
evolution.

*Harald Störrle,Anastasia Hort*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The study introduces a simpler approach that effectively predicts surgical durations using minimal data, integrating practitioner expertise and data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce hospital costs and improve medical outcomes by optimizing operating theater utilization through better surgery schedule predictions using simpler models and limited data.

Method: Used practitioner expertise for theory-guided data analysis, combined factor analysis and regression modeling for predicting perioperative process durations.

Result: Simple methods of central tendency rival and sometimes outperform complex methods, showing improved data quality and model accuracy via expert knowledge integration.

Conclusion: Integrating conventional data analysis with clinical insights allows for accurate forecasts with small datasets, surpassing results from prior work.

Abstract: Context: Utilization of operating theaters is a major cost driver in
hospitals. Optimizing this variable through optimized surgery schedules may
significantly lower cost and simultaneously improve medical outcomes. Previous
studies proposed various complex models to predict the duration of procedures,
the key ingredient to optimal schedules. They did so perusing large amounts of
data.
  Goals: We aspire to create an effective and efficient model to predict
operation durations based on only a small amount of data. Ideally, our model is
also simpler in structure, and thus easier to use.
  Methods: We immerse ourselves in the application domain to leverage
practitioners expertise. This way, we make the best use of our limited supply
of clinical data, and may conduct our data analysis in a theory-guided way. We
do a combined factor analysis and develop regression models to predict the
duration of the perioperative process.
  Findings: We found simple methods of central tendency to perform on a par
with much more complex methods proposed in the literature. In fact, they
sometimes outperform them. We conclude that combining expert knowledge with
data analysis may improve both data quality and model performance, allowing for
more accurate forecasts.
  Conclusion: We yield better results than previous researchers by integrating
conventional data science methods with qualitative studies of clinical settings
and process structure. Thus, we are able to leverage even small datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework using quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) to analyze exoplanetary atmospheres, demonstrating its efficiency and fault tolerance on current quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead in studying exoplanetary atmospheres caused by the high-dimensionality of parameter spaces when relying on traditional forward models.

Method: The study employs quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) as a black box for processing input data and introduces a fault-tolerant framework suitable for near-term quantum devices. A demonstration was implemented on IBM Fez.

Result: The proposed QELM framework effectively extracted atmospheric features and showcased the potential of quantum computing in astrophysical dataset analysis.

Conclusion: QELMs may enable faster, more efficient, and accurate exoplanet atmospheric models, presenting a promising near-term computational tool using quantum devices.

Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome ethical and practical barriers in studying judicial panel deliberations and to assess the efficacy and fairness of justice systems.

Method: A Multi-Agent System (SAMVAD) is developed featuring agents representing judicial roles, utilizing a RAG-supported legal knowledge base and iterative deliberation rounds for verdict consensus.

Result: SAMVAD integrates domain-specific legal grounding and deliberative mechanisms to simulate legally sound and transparent judicial decision-making processes.

Conclusion: SAMVAD serves as a sophisticated platform for exploring legal reasoning and group dynamics in simulations, offering explainability and consistency, specifically tailored to Indian judiciary contexts.

Abstract: Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)
designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the
Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

### [304] [No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404)
*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A resume-screening experiment revealed that people working with AI systems exhibiting racial bias often emulate such bias in their decisions. Implicit association tests (IATs) can partially mitigate this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI systems' racial bias affects human collaborative decision-making in resume screening, and to explore potential strategies to mitigate these biases.

Method: The study involved a resume-screening experiment with simulated AI models displaying race-based bias. It examined 1,526 scenarios with implicit association tests (IATs) to measure participants' unconscious biases.

Result: When exposed to biased AI systems, participants mirrored the AI's biases up to 90% of the time, even if they perceived the AI as low quality. Completing an IAT increased the likelihood of selecting candidates with non-stereotypical racial statuses by 13%.

Conclusion: AI systems' racial biases significantly influence human decision-making, even unconsciously. Organizational and regulatory policies should account for this complexity, emphasizing education, oversight, and bias mitigation strategies in AI-human collaborative systems.

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

### [305] [Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Adversarial Evidence in the Health Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03787)
*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the robustness of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems in the health domain when subjected to adversarial misinformation in the retrieved evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential for harm in the health domain from incorrect responses necessitates a study of RAG systems' robustness to adversarial evidence.

Method: The authors conducted controlled experiments with varying types of retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, adversarial) and question framings (consistent, neutral, inconsistent) to assess alignment with ground truth.

Result: Adversarial documents significantly degrade alignment, but robustness can be maintained with the presence of helpful evidence in the retrieval pool.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and emphasizes the importance of implementing retrieval safeguards to design safer RAG systems for high-stakes domains like health.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

TL;DR: This paper introduces NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework leveraging internal representations of large language models for ad-hoc Named Entity Retrieval based on user-defined type descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in conventional Named Entity Recognition methods, such as reliance on predefined schemas or fine-tuning, by creating a framework for flexible, scalable, and schema-free entity retrieval.

Method: The framework embeds both entity mentions and open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space using mid-layer transformer block value vectors from large language models. A lightweight contrastive projection network then refines these embeddings to enhance type-awareness and compatibility.

Result: NER Retriever outperforms existing lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval models on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved entity retrieval accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the utility of leveraging mid-layer LLM representations for fine-grained type interpretation and presents a robust, schema-free solution for ad-hoc entity retrieval. The codebase is made publicly accessible for further use.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Automated Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework for recommender systems, which automatically adjusts hyperparameters to meet secondary objectives or 'guardrails.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining secondary objectives (guardrails) in recommender systems, especially amidst system changes, without requiring extensive manual hyperparameter tuning.

Method: ACT performs offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to identify minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and continuously retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes.

Result: The framework successfully ensures guardrail objectives are met with minimal intervention and demonstrates measurable effectiveness in a large-scale production environment.

Conclusion: ACT provides an efficient, automated, and adaptive solution for enforcing guardrails in recommender systems, reducing manual tuning efforts and maintaining ecosystem stability.

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based approach for automated relevance evaluation in search systems, replacing traditional human annotations to improve efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of human annotation in relevance evaluation, such as high cost and slow turnaround time, and to make evaluation scalable in personalized search systems.

Method: The paper proposes the use of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to generate relevance judgments, validates their alignment with human annotations, and leverages them for optimized query sets and sampling designs.

Result: The results show that LLM-generated evaluations align well with human annotations, improve evaluation efficiency, allow assessment of diverse query sets, and reduce the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiments.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a scalable and efficient alternative for relevance evaluation in search systems, leading to improved metrics and experimental outcomes while reducing human dependency.

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 'local-to-global' image retrieval paradigm that combines efficient local feature search and dynamic global feature re-ranking, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in image retrieval systems, where current reliance on global feature search often misses partial matches, and computational costs limit the applicability of local feature methods.

Method: The authors propose a novel re-ranking approach where global features are dynamically computed using local feature retrieval results, leveraging multidimensional scaling for embedding.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The local-to-global paradigm with dynamic global feature re-ranking offers a significant performance boost for image retrieval and sets a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in retrieving and understanding complex technical documentation, which is crucial for efficient workflows in hardware and software development.

Method: The approach involves enhancing queries to improve fine-tuning diversity, extracting summarized contexts from documents, and fine-tuning a BERT bi-encoder model using specialized techniques such as soft prompting.

Conclusion: The integration of query expansion and contextual summarization enhances semantic retrieval for technical domains, advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems and improving information access in engineering workflows.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product
development workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework combining diverse upstream models and downstream integration to improve user and item embedding techniques for personalized recommendations on Pinterest, leading to significant performance boosts in ad ranking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of personalized Pin and ad recommendations by leveraging diverse data embeddings.

Method: The framework uses upstream models trained on varied signals to generate embeddings asynchronously. These embeddings are later used in downstream tasks, such as ad ranking and CTR/CVR predictions.

Result: The framework demonstrates substantial improvements in both offline evaluations and real-world online performance metrics.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and scalable, offering significant enhancements to Pinterest's personalized ad delivery systems while being deployed in production-level scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

*Junyu Lu,Di Jiang,Mengze Hong,Victor Junqiu Wei,Qintian Guo,Zhiyang Su*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Contextualized Token Discrimination (CTD) to improve speech query correction using BERT and introduces a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of speech search driven by ASR systems necessitates accurate correction of queries to help users express their intentions clearly.

Method: The CTD method uses BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations, applies a composition layer to enhance semantics, and corrects queries via token comparison.

Result: Experiments validate the effectiveness of CTD, showing superior performance across all metrics. Additionally, a new benchmark dataset for audio query correction is presented.

Conclusion: The proposed CTD method significantly improves speech query corrections, benefiting from semantic enhancements with BERT and providing a benchmark for future evaluations.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

### [313] [AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04345)
*Qizhou Wang,Hanxun Huang,Guansong Pang,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A new dataset called AUDETER is introduced, consisting of over 4,500 hours of diverse deepfake audio clips, for improving deepfake audio detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake audio detection systems are hindered by their inability to generalize to novel audio samples due to training on outdated and less diverse datasets.

Method: A comprehensive audio dataset, AUDETER, was created with over 3 million audio clips generated using 11 text-to-speech models and 10 vocoders, providing diverse examples for real and synthetic audio categories.

Result: Existing deepfake detection methods trained on AUDETER showed a reduction in error rates by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving a 4.17% error rate on cross-domain samples, outperforming models trained on other datasets.

Conclusion: AUDETER significantly enhances the generalization capabilities of deepfake detection systems and sets a new standard for robust audio deepfake identification.

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.
AUDETER is available on GitHub.

### [314] [Neural Video Compression with In-Loop Contextual Filtering and Out-of-Loop Reconstruction Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04051)
*Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Yiming Wang,Semih Esenlik,Zhaobin Zhang,Kai Zhang,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhancement filtering techniques for neural video compression, improving efficiency via in-loop and out-of-loop strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle error propagation and improve compression efficiency in neural video codecs.

Method: The authors propose in-loop contextual filtering to refine temporal contexts and out-of-loop enhancement for frame reconstruction, combined with an adaptive coding decision strategy.

Result: Experiments show a 7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs.

Conclusion: Enhancement filtering is shown to be effective in reducing bit rate and improving coding efficiency for neural video compression frameworks.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Junqi Liao,Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Zhipin Deng,Li Li,Dong Liu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec with key features to improve video quality and coding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current neural video codecs show remarkable efficiency but have limitations due to mismatches in the hierarchical quality and reference structures.

Method: EHVC introduces three key innovations: hierarchical multi-reference scheme, lookahead strategy utilizing future frame context, and random quality training strategy to enhance hierarchical quality stabilization.

Result: EHVC outperforms state-of-the-art neural video codecs in terms of performance.

Conclusion: EHVC addresses key challenges in neural video coding and aligns reference and quality structures, demonstrating notable improvements in video coding efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code
will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.

*Cédric Join,Michel Fliess*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This study proposes flatness-based control with HEOL feedback and model-free predictive control as alternatives to reinforcement learning (RL) for collision avoidance, showcasing their efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of RL in terms of requiring a large number of trials and proposes alternative methods for collision avoidance.

Method: Flatness-based control with HEOL feedback and model-free predictive control are employed using the Dubins' car model, and their performances are compared via simulations.

Result: Both methods achieve robust performance against disturbances, with the model-free approach exhibiting excellent robustness and low computational requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer effective and computationally efficient solutions for collision avoidance, outperforming RL in robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

### [317] [Compatibility of Multiple Control Barrier Functions for Constrained Nonlinear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04220)
*Max H. Cohen,Eugene Lavretsky,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for designing safe controllers for nonlinear systems with multiple constraints using multiple Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods primarily focus on handling systems with only a single CBF constraint, making it difficult to handle systems with multiple state constraints.

Method: The authors propose a solution for constrained control of nonlinear systems with vector-valued outputs and box constraints using multiple, compatible CBFs.

Result: The proposed approach results in an optimization-based controller that is locally Lipschitz continuous, has a closed-form expression, and maintains system safety under multiple constraints.

Conclusion: The framework is validated through simulations of a planar quadrotor, showing its ability to manage multiple constraints and balance safety with tracking objectives.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

### [318] [Leveraging Equivariances and Symmetries in the Control Barrier Function Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04399)
*Adrian Wiltz,Dimos V. Dimarogonas*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper explores how dynamics' symmetry properties can simplify and speed up Control Barrier Function (CBF) synthesis by utilizing equivariances and symmetry in constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBF synthesis often requires exhaustive computations; leveraging system dynamics' structural properties, like equivariances, could ease this process.

Method: The authors investigate how symmetry (equivariances) in dynamics and constraints can induce symmetry in CBFs through reachability analysis. They propose a way to construct CBFs for new constraints using partial CBF knowledge paired with equivariances.

Result: They demonstrate that equivariances significantly reduce computational demands. Examples and numerical studies illustrate the theoretical framework and validate the computational gains.

Conclusion: Equivariances in system dynamics offer a practical avenue to simplify and enhance CBF synthesis processes, even for systems with non-symmetric constraints.

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

*Babak Esmaeili,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven motion-planning framework for multi-agent systems in shared environments, using convex optimization and invariant ellipsoids for safety and feasibility, combined with a tree-based planning approach for coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of motion planning for multi-agent systems in shared and obstacle-filled spaces without relying on explicit system models, ensuring dynamic feasibility, safety, and collision avoidance.

Method: The framework uses convex semidefinite programs to generate locally invariant ellipsoids to certify feasibility and safety; a tree-based sampling planner ensures transitions between these ellipsoids, coordinated by a space-time reservation table to avoid inter-agent collisions.

Result: The approach successfully generates synchronized and safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, as shown through simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method is an effective data-driven solution for multi-agent motion planning, ensuring safe and feasible trajectories using only data and convex optimization tools.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

TL;DR: This paper integrates echo-state networks with model predictive path integral control for fast learning and control of nonlinear dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving fast online identification and control of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems.

Method: Combining echo-state networks for nonlinear dynamics learning with parallelized model predictive path integral control.

Result: The integration improves control performance, reducing costs by up to 60% compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware RPPI enhances dynamic system control by leveraging ESN uncertainty to balance learning and performance.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

*Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti,Andrea Del Prete*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses the certification of safety in dynamical systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), presenting a Lipschitz-based verification method to simplify robust computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the challenges in certifying the safety of dynamical systems by using Control Invariant (CI) sets, a critical tool, while tackling the intractability of the robust optimization tasks required to compute Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).

Method: A verification approach based on Lipschitz continuity arguments was introduced. The procedure contributes to developing a sample-efficient certification algorithm for validating whether scenario-based CBFs satisfy robust constraints.

Result: The proposed Lipschitz-based verification approach demonstrated efficiency in a numerical example, validating its robustness and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The verification method simplifies the problem of certifying safety using CBFs and offers a practical, sample-efficient algorithm for robust constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high manual effort in state estimation deployment, leveraging transformer-based foundation models for zero-shot generalization, overcoming the reliance on pre-trained sensor models seen during training.

Method: Integration of a transformer-based system dynamics model with analytically known sensor models using the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), enabling generalization to different sensor configurations.

Result: FM-UKF provides competitive accuracy, robustness, and effort balance, demonstrated via a benchmark on complex container ship dynamics compared to classical and end-to-end methods.

Conclusion: FM-UKF shows promise in enabling zero-shot generalization for state estimation tasks, even with varying dynamics and sensors, offering an open-sourced benchmark to support further research in the field.

Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires
extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the trade-off between fast charging and battery aging using a hybrid control strategy combining Reinforcement Learning and formal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing the speed of lithium-ion battery charging with minimal aging effects, which results in capacity loss, is a key challenge in improving battery performance and prolonging its lifespan.

Method: The authors adopt a hybrid approach involving Reinforcement Learning to design controllers and data-driven formal methods to guide partitioning into a switched control structure. Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis is used to iteratively refine the design.

Result: The proposed methodology results in a hybrid system, where controllers and switching depend on initial battery output measurements, delivering probabilistic performance guarantees for meeting desired objectives.

Conclusion: The study presents an innovative approach to safe and efficient battery management, advancing the design of charging protocols that optimize both speed and longevity under provable guarantees.

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

Method: COBRA employs a D-Net architecture featuring U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head self-attention, and BiLSTM for temporal processing using wearable multimodal sensors. The approach was validated on the WISDM-Smart dataset.

Result: COBRA achieved an overall accuracy of 96.86%, with high F1-scores for specific behavioral categories and outperformed state-of-the-art methods by 1.18%. It also showed robust performance across diverse demographics with less than 3% variance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, reliable solution for continuous, objective monitoring of obesity-relevant behaviors, supporting personalized healthcare interventions.

Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance
behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant
underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern
digital health systems. This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral
Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective

hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head
self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily
activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical
Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart
dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal
preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving
high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86%
overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical
Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily
Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The
framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%),
enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and
continuous lifestyle monitoring.

TL;DR: Sparse optimization effectively discovers governing equations in chaotic systems, but these equations vary with measurement methods while still producing identical chaotic attractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstrate challenges in deterministic modeling for chaotic systems where imperfect data from disturbances and measurement errors affects model reliability.

Method: Evaluate sparse-optimization methods for chaotic systems, comparing their governing equations and analyzing Koopman spectra for eigenvalue trends.

Result: Models generated through sparse optimization depend on measurement method but produce identical chaotic attractors, with large eigenvalues showing agreement and divergences in smaller eigenvalues.

Conclusion: Equation-based modeling is challenged in complex dynamical systems; direct data analysis, such as using machine-learning methods, is a better alternative.

Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a
popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering
the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and
measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used
sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models
that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models
generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking
limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling
in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the
different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the
differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an
equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing
equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to
misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the
available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.

### [326] [Natural Latents: Latent Variables Stable Across Ontologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03780)
*John Wentworth,David Lorell*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper explores the conditions under which two Bayesian agents can relate their latent variables when they have converged on the same predictive distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between latent variables in different generative models can improve coordination and knowledge sharing between Bayesian agents.

Method: The authors propose the 'natural latent conditions' as a framework and derive theorems establishing these conditions. They analyze the robustness of this framework to approximation errors.

Result: The study finds that the natural latent conditions are the simplest and most general conditions under which latent variable translatability is guaranteed between agents.

Conclusion: The paper establishes robust theoretical guidelines for translating latent variables among Bayesian agents, aiding practical applications in collaboration and model interoperability.

Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same
environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive
distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but
may have different generative models containing different latent variables.
Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function
of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be
possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further
constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability
is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to
approximation error in the natural latent conditions.

### [327] [Gravity Well Echo Chamber Modeling With An LLM-Based Confirmation Bias Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03832)
*Joseph Jackson,Georgiy Lapin,Jeremy E. Thompson*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a confirmation bias-based extension to the gravity well model to better identify echo chambers and their role in spreading misinformation, validated through analysis of Reddit communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spread of misinformation through echo chambers on social media by accounting for individual confirmation bias in existing models.

Method: Researchers proposed an extension to the gravity well model using a dynamic confirmation bias variable calculated from users' interactions and posting history across diverse viewpoints. This enhanced model is tested on Reddit communities.

Result: The updated model demonstrated improved ability to identify echo chambers compared to existing methods and highlighted markers of information health at the community level.

Conclusion: The confirmation-bias-integrated gravity well model serves as a novel framework to identify echo chambers more effectively, aiding efforts to mitigate misinformation amplification.

Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of
misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual
confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well"
model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells.
We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias
variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to
belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through
comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a
wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity
well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals
community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on
nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of
confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective
identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the
model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common
points of amplification.

*Haoyu Jiang,Yuexi Wang,Yun Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A novel simulation-based inference method integrates score matching with Langevin dynamics to improve Bayesian analysis efficiency in complex high-dimensional parameter spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges faced by simulation-based inference methods in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces motivated the study, leveraging gradient-based Monte Carlo methods.

Method: The method combines score matching with Langevin dynamics and involves tailored techniques like localization schemes and architectural regularization to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The proposed approach performs well on benchmark tasks and challenges in moderate to high-dimensional spaces, showing advantages compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The integration of score matching with Langevin dynamics advances Bayesian analysis, particularly in high-dimensional settings, offering improved posterior exploration and reduced simulation costs.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the
likelihood is intractable but model simulations are available. Recent advances
in statistics and machine learning, including Approximate Bayesian Computation
and deep generative models, have expanded the applicability of SBI, yet these
methods often face challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian
sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with
Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in
such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for
SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an
architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of
log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide
theoretical analysis of the method and illustrate its practical benefits on
benchmark tasks and on more challenging problems in moderate to high
dimensions, where it performs favorably compared to existing approaches.

*Yang Liu,Chaoyu Yuan*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based approach for comparing uplift models, focusing on uncertainty quantification in uplift curve estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for understanding model differences in uplift modeling within marketing, especially when it is not feasible to use the entire population and uncertainty quantification has been neglected in prior work.

Method: The authors propose a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based method for quantifying uncertainty in uplift curve estimates.

Result: They test their proposed methodology through simulations and real-world data applications, demonstrating its feasibility and usefulness.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of uncertainty quantification in comparing uplift models and presents a novel method to overcome this challenge.

Abstract: Uplift models play a critical role in modern marketing applications to help
understand the incremental benefits of interventions and identify optimal
targeting strategies. A variety of techniques exist for building uplift models,
and it is essential to understand the model differences in the context of
intended applications. The uplift curve is a widely adopted tool for assessing
uplift model performance on the selection universe when observations are
available for the entire population. However, when it is uneconomical or
infeasible to select the entire population, it becomes difficult or even
impossible to estimate the uplift curve without appropriate sampling design. To
the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed uncertainty
quantification of uplift curve estimates, which is essential for model
comparisons. We propose a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based
approach to compare uplift models with uncertainty quantification, examine the
proposed method via simulations and real data applications, and conclude with a
discussion.

*Shota Arai,David Selby,Andrew Vargo,Sebastian Vollmer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework using LLMs for hierarchical Bayesian adverse event modeling in clinical trials, allowing reduced patient numbers while maintaining statistical robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a more efficient clinical trial system by leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs to reduce the number of participants needed without sacrificing statistical power.

Method: The method involves using pre-trained LLMs to inform prior distributions in hierarchical Bayesian models, systematically incorporating external clinical expertise for improved safety assessment.

Result: The study shows that LLM-derived priors improve predictive performance over traditional methods through sensitivity analysis and cross-validation with real-world data.

Conclusion: This approach could transform clinical trial design by reducing participant requirements, enhancing drug safety monitoring, and informing regulatory decisions more effectively.

Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the
same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language
models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling
of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed
prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate
synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from
the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for
hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM,
enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into
Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity
analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we
demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance
compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the
way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling
substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust
safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring
and regulatory decision making.

*Chatipat Lorpaiboon,Jonathan Weare,Aaron R. Dinner*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper addresses inaccuracies in estimating the committor and transition rates in dynamical systems, proposing improved methods for lag time invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating committors and transition rates yield biased results when the lag time is not a single step, hindering accuracy in practical applications.

Method: The authors introduce an alternative expression for the committor that ensures accuracy at any lag time and numerically test it on benchmark systems. They also derive an additional expression for the transition rate and utilize a decomposition of error into dynamic modes for further analysis.

Result: The proposed committor and transition rate estimation method is shown to exhibit significantly less sensitivity to lag time, improving robustness in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: This study offers a more reliable framework for committor and transition rate estimation, enhancing dynamical system analysis by addressing lag time sensitivity.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability in materials science by merging traditional feature-based models with the advantages of deep learning frameworks.

Method: MatterVial integrates latent features from pretrained GNNs, computationally efficient descriptors, and symbolic regression to expand the feature space and enhance MODNet's performance.

Result: The framework achieves over 40% accuracy improvements for multiple tasks, outperforming several state-of-the-art GNN models.

Conclusion: MatterVial offers a high-performance and interpretable AI framework for materials discovery, advancing the scope of targeted and autonomous research in the field.

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted

*Marina Struleva,Shayan Hundrieser,Dominic Schuhmacher,Axel Munk*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This study focuses on analyzing empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal transport (UOT), specifically for Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance in spatio-temporal point processes, providing convergence rates for such measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the robust estimation of UOT distances for intensity measures generated by spatio-temporal point processes, where traditional assumptions about balance may fail.

Method: The method includes modeling observations as weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures. Under certain temporal growth conditions, convergence rates for empirical estimators are derived as functions of intrinsic dimensions, alongside lower bounds to demonstrate minimax optimality.

Result: The results establish convergence rates for empirical UOT estimators under different temporal growth assumptions and validate these results using examples like Poisson cluster and Hawkes processes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that empirical UOT estimators for the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance achieve minimax optimality for a wide variety of real-world spatio-temporal point processes under sub-quadratic variance growth conditions.

Abstract: We statistically analyze empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal
transport (UOT) formalisms, focusing on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance,
between general intensity measures based on observations from spatio-temporal
point processes. Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly
time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish
sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic
dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition
of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal
dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes
slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial
covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes,
including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox
processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower
bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish
near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-offs between complexity and efficiency in controller synthesis strategies, and investigate recent advancements that challenge traditional assumptions.

Method: The author examines memory and randomness in strategies within game-theoretic synthesis contexts, integrating recent findings and offering a brief evaluation of unconventional complexity measures.

Result: Recent insights reveal nuanced dependencies of strategy complexity on memory and randomness, while suggesting potential advantages in exploring alternative complexity paradigms in synthesis methods.

Conclusion: The study underscores the implications of strategy complexity on controller synthesis and encourages expanding the perspective beyond traditional metrics to optimize design and functionality.

Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the
interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game
between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal)
strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a
real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited
memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive
and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a
variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and
randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions
of complexity for strategies.

### [335] [Hypothesis Selection: A High Probability Conundrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03734)
*Anders Aamand,Maryam Aliakbarpour,Justin Y. Chen,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper advances the hypothesis selection problem by improving algorithm runtime and addressing unresolved issues in alternative settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem seeks efficient methods to identify candidate hypotheses close to the unknown distribution, with optimal performance in confidence and error parameters.

Method: The authors focus on reducing time complexities for hypothesis selection algorithms and explore three alternative settings using preprocessing, expected distance bounds, and known parameters.

Result: The study achieves improved runtime of $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$, resolves optimal settings for expected distances, advances runtime when $\mathsf{OPT}$ is known, and introduces preprocessing for subquadratic runtime.

Conclusion: Key theoretical advancements are made in hypothesis selection, improving sample complexity, runtime, and approximation factors across multiple settings.

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given a finite set of candidate
distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples
from an unknown distribution $P$. Our goal is to find a hypothesis $H_i$ whose
total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis
in $\mathcal{H}$. If the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output
an $H_i$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation
distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$.
  Despite decades of work, key aspects of this problem remain unresolved,
including the optimal running time for algorithms that achieve the optimal
sample complexity and best possible approximation factor of $C=3$. The previous
state-of-the-art result [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided a
nearly linear in $n$ time algorithm but with a sub-optimal dependence on the
other parameters, running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We
improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$,
significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.
  Furthermore, we study hypothesis selection in three alternative settings,
resolving or making progress on several open questions from prior works. (1) We
settle the optimal approximation factor when bounding the \textit{expected
distance} of the output hypothesis, rather than its high-probability
performance. (2) Assuming the numerical value of \textit{$\mathsf{OPT}$ is
known} in advance, we present an algorithm obtaining $C=3$ and runtime
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ with the optimal sample complexity and succeeding
with high probability in $n$. (3) Allowing polynomial \textit{preprocessing}
step on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ before observing samples, we present
an algorithm with $C=3$ and subquadratic runtime which succeeds with high
probability in $n$.

*Paresh Baidya,Rourab Paul,Vikas Srivastava,Sumit Kumar Debnath*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses intentional fault injection issues in Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) hardware accelerators by proposing three fault detection methods for Barrett Reduction in Kyber using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to secure hardware implementations of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, like Kyber, from deliberate fault injections that compromise their reliability and leak sensitive information.

Method: Proposed three recomputation-based fault detection methods for Barrett Reduction: Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO), and Recomputation with Shifted Operand (RESO). RESWO is introduced as a novel optimized method.

Result: RESWO achieves lesser delay while consuming similar slice resources as RENO and RESO, with all three methods exhibiting nearly 100% fault detection efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively improve fault detection in the hardware implementation of PQC algorithms, enhancing security with minimal resource consumption and maximum efficiency.

Abstract: A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally
injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)
algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in
side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The
recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also
leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three
efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for
Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are
fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including
Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new
algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection.
While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted
Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett
Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices
compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both
RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is
nearly 100%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework called Reactive Bottom-Up Testing, aimed at improving vulnerability detection in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic testing is a prominent approach for vulnerability detection, but current techniques face challenges in reaching deep call graph functions and reducing false positives.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage bottom-up testing approach: (1) identify vulnerable functions and create suitable harnesses, (2) fuzz test to find crashes and extract input constraints, (3) validate and refine crashes to remove false positives.

Result: Their prototype, called Griller, detected 28 known vulnerabilities in a benchmark of 48 across 5 projects, and discovered 6 new vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Reactive Bottom-Up Testing enhances deep function vulnerability detection and introduces more reliable security analysis, aiding robust security practices.

Abstract: Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers
apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most
common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a
top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the
call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address
these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating
valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.
  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up
Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not
sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is
a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also
validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that
detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a
three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions
and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and
extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by
combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated
prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting
using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,
where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we
evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it
discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that
Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of
vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security
practices.

*Junhui Li,Chengbin Feng,Zhiwei Yang,Qi Mo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIDO, a hybrid image-based malware detection system that addresses challenges related to obfuscation and concept drift using statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware detection methods face significant performance issues with obfuscated data or concept drift, and existing approaches often address these challenges independently, failing to tap into their shared statistical root (out-of-distribution).

Method: BIDO enhances malware detection by combining local feature selection, cross-modal dependency modeling, and a learnable metric for feature compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate BIDO’s superior robustness and performance over existing methods in detecting malware effectively under conditions of obfuscation and concept drift.

Conclusion: The study suggests that BIDO’s integrated approach can significantly improve the scalability and robustness of malware detection techniques, addressing shared challenges effectively.

Abstract: To identify malicious Android applications, various malware detection
techniques have been proposed. Among them, image-based approaches are
considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability.
Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant
performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift.
However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different
problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact
that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and
research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a
hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both
obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the
discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection
module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to
enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an
outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns.
Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls
samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different
labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on
the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms
existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and
obfuscation. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous advancements in jailbreak attack techniques pose security challenges to large language models, necessitating deeper understanding of their vulnerabilities.

Method: NeuroBreak uses layer-wise representation probing analysis to examine neuron-level safety mechanisms, incorporating insights from AI security experts and allowing semantic and functional analysis of critical neurons.

Result: NeuroBreak provides comprehensive analysis of jailbreak attack methods and demonstrates its effectiveness via quantitative evaluations and case studies.

Conclusion: The system offers mechanistic insights for designing robust defenses against jailbreak attacks, contributing to the development of next-generation security strategies.

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMAE4Eth, a multi-view framework for Ethereum fraud detection, combining transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge to achieve improved account detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods have limitations in capturing transaction semantics and handling the homogeneity of transaction data. Additionally, existing graph learning methods face scalability and performance issues for node-level tasks.

Method: The authors propose LMAE4Eth, combining a Transaction-token Contrastive Language Model (TxCLM) for generating semantic transaction representations, a Masked Account Graph Autoencoder (MAGAE) for account detection, and a cross-attention network for unifying embeddings.

Result: Their method surpasses 21 baseline approaches, achieving over 10% improvement in F1-score on two datasets used for evaluation.

Conclusion: LMAE4Eth demonstrates significant advancements in solving scalability and discriminative embedding challenges for fraud detection tasks in Ethereum.

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

### [341] [KubeGuard: LLM-Assisted Kubernetes Hardening via Configuration Files and Runtime Logs Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04191)
*Omri Sgan Cohen,Ehud Malul,Yair Meidan,Dudu Mimran,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces KubeGuard, a framework using large language models (LLMs) to enhance Kubernetes security by creating and refining least-privilege configurations based on runtime logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes security is challenged by misconfigurations and overly permissive settings, leading to risks like unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

Method: KubeGuard utilizes large language models to analyze runtime logs and manifests through modular prompt-chaining workflows, providing least-privilege configuration recommendations.

Result: KubeGuard successfully enhances security by generating precise and practical recommendations for Kubernetes manifests, validated through high precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: KubeGuard is a practical and effective solution for improving Kubernetes security by translating runtime observability into actionable configuration improvements.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

*Guglielmo Gattiglio,Lyudmila Grigoryeva,Massimiliano Tamborrino*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This work introduces Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic version of the GParareal algorithm for solving differential equations with uncertainty quantification, showcasing its robustness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the need for probabilistic extensions to established Parallel-in-Time (PinT) methods, enabling uncertainty quantification and compatibility with existing numerical solvers for ODEs and PDEs.

Method: The authors propose Prob-GParareal, which incorporates Gaussian processes (GPs) to model numerical uncertainty while solving differential equations and maintains compatibility with traditional solvers. They also present a variant, Prob-nnGParareal, using nearest-neighbors GPs.

Result: The authors theoretically derive computational complexity and error bounds for Prob-GParareal and validate its accuracy through numerical experiments on five ODE systems and one PDE case, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: Prob-GParareal and its variant bridge the gap between existing PinT methods and probabilistic approaches, offering a reliable and scalable framework for solving differential equations with built-in uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal
algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the
Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential
equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model
the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the
propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic
forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates
probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical
numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing
Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the
computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we
numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm
on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation
problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed
algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing
the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased
performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in
the development of probabilistic counterparts to established PinT methods.

### [343] [Finetuning AI Foundation Models to Develop Subgrid-Scale Parameterizations: A Case Study on Atmospheric Gravity Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03816)
*Aman Gupta,Aditi Sheshadri,Sujit Roy,Johannes Schmude,Vishal Gaur,Wei Ji Leong,Manil Maskey,Rahul Ramachandran*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the use of pre-trained AI foundation models (FMs) in climate modeling, specifically demonstrating superior parameterization performance for atmospheric gravity waves compared to existing machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unresolved subgrid-scale processes like gravity waves and turbulence in climate models cause significant uncertainty. The paper aims to improve parameterizations using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: The study fine-tunes a pre-trained 2.3 billion parameter AI foundation model known as Prithvi WxC to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves. It learns fluxes from finer-resolution atmospheric reanalysis.

Result: The fine-tuned FM parameterization showed superior predictive performance over baseline machine learning models, including regions excluded from pre-training. Performance was quantified, showcasing improvements in Hellinger distance metrics.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer reusable and versatile tools for creating accurate parameterizations in climate modeling, paving the way for enhanced earth-system applications that rely on observation-driven methods.

Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes
like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be
sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes
are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to
developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes
by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely
unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3
billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a
latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned
(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity
waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution
climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10
times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous
evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals
superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the
atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost
is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and
0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and
reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-
and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of
observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more
earth-system processes.
