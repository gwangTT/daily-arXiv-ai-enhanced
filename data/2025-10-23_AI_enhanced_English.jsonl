Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this\ncontext, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the\nvast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve\nsingle-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research\nefforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular\ndownstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To\naddress this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of\ngeneralizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for\ninference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative\nlearning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal\nmodel manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We\nevaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and\nregression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the\nmodalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our\nresults demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art\napproaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as\nwell as EO-specific methods.

This paper investigates whether\nincreasing the layer depth of deep neural networks affects their robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)\ndomain. We compare the adversarial robustness of various deep neural networks\nacross both \\ac{NIDS} and computer vision domains (the latter being widely used\nin adversarial attack experiments). Our experimental results reveal that in the\nNIDS domain, adding more layers does not necessarily improve their performance,\nyet it may actually significantly degrade their robustness against adversarial\nattacks. Conversely, in the computer vision domain, adding more layers exhibits\na more modest impact on robustness. These findings can guide the development of\nrobust neural networks for (NIDS) applications and highlight the unique\ncharacteristics of network security domains within the (ML) landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "Increasing the layer depth in Deep Neural Networks does not universally enhance adversarial robustness, especially in Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) applications.", "motivation": "The paper aims to address whether the depth of deep neural networks impacts their robustness against adversarial attacks, specifically within the NIDS domain.", "method": "The adversarial robustness of DNNs was evaluated by comparing deep neural networks across the NIDS and computer vision domains.", "result": "In the NIDS domain, adding more layers may degrade robustness against adversarial attacks, whereas in the computer vision domain, deeper layers have a modest impact on robustness.", "conclusion": "Increasing layer depth does not guarantee improved adversarial robustness in NIDS and may negatively influence it, guiding the design of robust neural networks tailored for specific applications."}}
