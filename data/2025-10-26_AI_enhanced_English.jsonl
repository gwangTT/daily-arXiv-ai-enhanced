Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of\nsimultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and\nconditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.\nFor example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row\nactivation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,\nincreasing the temperature from 50{\\deg}C to 90{\\deg}C decreases SiMRA's\nentropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation.

That\nparadox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be\nmet by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of\nthat use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers.

A side\neffect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the\nprobability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite\nthere being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword\nvocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by\nmarginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.\n  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a\ntext, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a\ndownside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by\nthe LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be\nacquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the\napproximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the\ntokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we\ninvestigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no\ngeneration from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling\nstrategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.\n  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling\nstrategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently\naccurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and\ndemonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores decoding-free strategies to estimate marginal probabilities in language models without relying on expensive generation steps, achieving faster and sufficiently accurate results.", "motivation": "Language models currently evaluate text probabilities by considering only specific tokenizations, which limits accuracy and demands high computational resources for marginalization via sampling.", "method": "The authors investigate decoding-free sampling strategies as alternatives to traditional sampling methods that involve computationally expensive generation steps.

In addition, this paper proposes an\nadversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and\nattack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL\nin detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space,\naction space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the\nattacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness\ntraining strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training,\nrobust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related\ndefense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these\nmethods in improving the robustness of DRL.
