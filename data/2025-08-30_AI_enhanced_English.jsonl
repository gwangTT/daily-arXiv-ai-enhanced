In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We\nevaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains\nof aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles\ngenerated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those\nobtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this\naccuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system\nunder test.

Through a study with 20\nparticipants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat\ninterface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired\ndesign implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal\ncommunication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable\nfeedback to improve LLM performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces OnGoal, a chat interface for LLMs that tracks goal progress to help users during long, complex dialogues.", "motivation": "To aid users in better managing and achieving conversational goals during long and complex interactions with large language models.", "method": "The OnGoal system offers real-time feedback on goal alignment, explanations with examples, and visual overviews of progression.

Companies\nsuch as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly\nwithin SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,\nopen-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor\nperformance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source\nsystems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to\nexpose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked\nLLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,\noptimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning.
