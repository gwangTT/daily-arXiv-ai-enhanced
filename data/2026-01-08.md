### [1] [Mastering the Game of Go with Self-play Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03306)
*Jingbin Liu,Xuechun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QZero, a model-free reinforcement learning method, masters the game of Go without relying on human data or search strategies, showcasing efficiency and off-policy feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if model-free reinforcement learning can master the complex strategic demands of the game of Go without relying on human data or model-based search methods.

Method: QZero employs entropy-regularized Q-learning and self-play along with off-policy experience replay, utilizing a single Q-value network for policy evaluation and improvement.

Result: QZero achieved performance comparable to AlphaGo, training from scratch for 5 months using 7 GPUs.

Conclusion: Model-free reinforcement learning like QZero can efficiently master complex environments like Go, highlighting new pathways for large-scale AI strategy development.

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

### [2] [Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335)
*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates the Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a self-play algorithm that applies continual adaptation using large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the dynamics of adversarial evolution. It develops warriors competing in the Core War game and reveals that evolving dynamic objectives may lead to general-purpose solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how embracing dynamic, adversarial Red Queen dynamics in evolution frameworks, instead of static optimization problems, can contribute to broader domains like artificial life and cybersecurity.

Method: The DRQ algorithm was implemented where an LLM evolves assembly-like programs (warriors) to compete against previous models in Core War. Over rounds, warriors adapt to become stronger adversaries against past iterations.

Result: The evolved warriors showed increased generalization against human competitors but also demonstrated reduced behavioral diversity, akin to convergent evolution in biology.

Conclusion: The study suggests that dynamic Red Queen objectives offer value by encouraging general-purpose solutions. DRQ's simplicity and effectiveness highlight its potential for further exploration in adversarial domains like cybersecurity and drug resistance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

### [3] [Enhancing LLM Instruction Following: An Evaluation-Driven Multi-Agentic Workflow for Prompt Instructions Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03359)
*Alberto Purpura,Li Wang,Sahil Badyal,Eugenio Beaufrand,Adam Faulkner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of formal inaccuracies in Large Language Models' (LLMs) outputs by introducing a multi-agentic workflow to improve prompt compliance iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate accurate content conceptually but fail to meet formal constraints; the need exists to develop prompts that ensure compliance with procedural accuracy.

Method: Proposed a multi-agent workflow to decouple task descriptions from granular constraints, utilizing iterative refinements informed by quantitative compliance scores.

Result: Using models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B, the proposed method demonstrates significantly improved compliance in LLM outputs.

Conclusion: The novel workflow effectively enhances procedural accuracy in LLM responses through iterative prompt optimization guided by compliance metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

### [4] [Exploration Through Introspection: A Self-Aware Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03389)
*Michael Petrowski,Milica Gašić*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces introspective reinforcement learning agents that infer internal states using biological pain-inspired methods to improve learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how artificial agents model internal mental states and advance Theory of Mind capabilities in AI.

Method: Introduces introspective exploration with pain-belief inferred via a hidden Markov model, integrated into the agent's reward function, and compares chronic vs normal pain perception models.

Result: Agents with introspection significantly outperform baseline models and mimic complex human-like behaviors.

Conclusion: Self-awareness through introspection enhances AI learning capabilities and enables human-like behavioral replication in agents.

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

### [5] [Toward Maturity-Based Certification of Embodied AI: Quantifying Trustworthiness Through Measurement Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03470)
*Michael C. Darling,Alan H. Hesu,Michael A. Mardikes,Brian C. McGuigan,Reed M. Milewicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a maturity-based framework for certifying embodied AI systems, focusing on structured assessment, measurement, and navigating trustworthiness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured and quantitative methods for certifying embodied AI systems effectively.

Method: Proposing a framework with explicit measurement mechanisms, using uncertainty quantification and a practical example involving a UAS detection case study.

Result: The feasibility of implementing this framework is demonstrated through a case study on UAS detection, showcasing the approach's utility.

Conclusion: Structured frameworks and quantitative assessments can improve the maturity and trustworthiness of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: We propose a maturity-based framework for certifying embodied AI systems through explicit measurement mechanisms. We argue that certifiable embodied AI requires structured assessment frameworks, quantitative scoring mechanisms, and methods for navigating multi-objective trade-offs inherent in trustworthiness evaluation. We demonstrate this approach using uncertainty quantification as an exemplar measurement mechanism and illustrate feasibility through an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) detection case study.

### [6] [CPGPrompt: Translating Clinical Guidelines into LLM-Executable Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03475)
*Ruiqi Deng,Geoffrey Martin,Tony Wang,Gongbo Zhang,Yi Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yanshan Wang,Justin F Rousseau,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPGPrompt, a novel system converting clinical practice guidelines into large language models to improve AI's adherence to medical guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical guideline integration in AI faces issues like limited interpretability, inconsistent adherence, and field-specific applicability.

Method: The authors developed CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that transforms guidelines into structured decision trees, using large language models for dynamic navigation. They tested the model's decisions on synthetic cases from three medical fields.

Result: Binary specialty referral classification performed highly across domains (F1: 0.85-1.00; recall: 1.00), whereas multi-class pathway decisions showed varying efficiency based on domain: F1 for headache (0.47), lower back pain (0.72), and prostate cancer (0.77).

Conclusion: The method is effective for binary decision-making, with domain-dependent challenges in complex pathway classifications due to guideline-specific reasoning requirements.

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

### [7] [Personalization of Large Foundation Models for Health Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03482)
*Stefan Konigorski,Johannes E. Vedder,Babajide Alamu Owoyele,İbrahim Özkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the limitations of large foundation models (LFMs) in personalized medicine and suggests integration with N-of-1 trials to address challenges and improve outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the limitations of LFMs in delivering truly personalized medicine and identify strategies like N-of-1 trials to overcome associated paradoxes and challenges in healthcare AI.

Method: The paper analyzes the drawbacks of LFMs and highlights the role of N-of-1 trials in ensuring personalized, causally validated treatments. It suggests a hybrid framework where LFMs generate hypotheses and N-of-1 trials validate them.

Result: The study finds that LFMs alone cannot address tensions like the generalizability paradox or causal understanding but can complement N-of-1 trials for better personalization in healthcare.

Conclusion: LFMs and N-of-1 trials should be integrated as a hybrid framework for personalized medicine to navigate paradoxical challenges and ensure responsible AI adoption in healthcare.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

### [8] [Evolving Programmatic Skill Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03509)
*Haochen Shi,Xingdi Yuan,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), enabling agents to learn, refine, and reuse skills in dynamic environments using a compositional framework driven by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework for continual and compositional skill acquisition in open-ended environments, addressing challenges of skill refinement, reuse, and adaptation.

Method: PSN incorporates executable symbolic programs represented as networks that evolve through experience. It uses three mechanisms: structured fault localization (REFLECT), maturity-aware optimization for skill stabilization, and structural refactoring to maintain compactness. It leverages large language models for these processes.

Result: Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter show PSN effectively supports skill reuse, quick adaptation, and generalization across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: PSN provides a robust framework for compositional and open-ended skill learning, showing promise for continual learning in complex environments.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

### [9] [Variance Computation for Weighted Model Counting with Knowledge Compilation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03523)
*Kengo Nakamura,Masaaki Nishino,Norihito Yasuda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses computational tractability in evaluating the variance of weighted model counting (WMC) under parameter uncertainty, deriving an efficient algorithm for structured d-DNNFs while proving hardness for other representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the challenge of dealing with uncertainty in inference outcomes due to parameter uncertainty in learned models, particularly in probabilistic models like Bayesian networks.

Method: The authors develop a polynomial-time algorithm for evaluating the variance of WMC when represented as structured d-DNNFs. They then prove the problem's computational hardness for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs.

Result: They provide an efficient algorithm for WMC variance computation in structured d-DNNFs and highlight computational hardness for other representation formats. Additionally, they demonstrate the application of this method to Bayesian networks and analyze real-world parameter uncertainty.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while evaluating WMC variance is tractable for structured d-DNNFs, it is computationally hard for other representations. The approach is applicable in assessing uncertainty in Bayesian network inference outcomes.

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

### [10] [STAR-S: Improving Safety Alignment through Self-Taught Reasoning on Safety Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03537)
*Di Wu,Yanyan Zhao,Xin Lu,Mingzhe Li,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes STAR-S, a framework to improve safety reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) for defending against jailbreak attacks through a self-taught reasoning loop incorporating safety rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks and enhance their ability to reason over safety rules, which has been difficult to efficiently design or implement.

Method: The STAR-S framework integrates elicitation of reasoning, guided by safety rules, into a self-taught loop. This loop leverages fine-tuning and iterative improvement in safety reasoning by producing better training data over time.

Result: STAR-S outperforms baseline methods in defending against jailbreak attacks and improves the reasoning of LLMs with respect to safety rules.

Conclusion: The self-taught reasoning approach of STAR-S demonstrates enhanced capability in shielding LLMs from jailbreak attacks, offering a promising pathway for safer LLM deployment.

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

### [11] [ReEfBench: Quantifying the Reasoning Efficiency of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03550)
*Zhizhang Fu,Yuancheng Gu,Chenkai Hu,Hanmeng Liu,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic framework for evaluating reasoning in Large Language Models and discovers the limitations of current reasoning evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation methods fail to fully determine if observed performance improvements in LLMs stem from genuine reasoning abilities or increased verbosity.

Method: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic framework to evaluate reasoning in a process-centric and non-intrusive manner, identifying diverse behavioral patterns, examining failure modes, and studying the impact of inference mode and training strategies.

Result: The study finds that extended token generation does not necessarily indicate deep reasoning. Mixing different CoT data types during training can lead to model degradation, while smaller models distilled from larger ones often lose logical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Accurate evaluation of reasoning requires a comprehensive approach, as performance improvements in LLMs do not always equate to better reasoning abilities due to intrinsic model constraints and training strategies.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

### [12] [SCRIBE: Structured Mid-Level Supervision for Tool-Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03555)
*Yuxuan Jiang,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a framework that applies skill-conditioned reward modeling to improve multi-step reasoning by linking subgoals to skill prototypes, achieving state-of-the-art results in reasoning and tool-use tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in training tool-augmented agents stems from difficulties in credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. Current LLM judges lack task-specific rubrics, resulting in noisy and inconsistent evaluations.

Method: SCRIBE introduces a framework that utilizes mid-level skill prototypes to provide structured rubrics, reducing reward variance in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Result: SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3% and enhancing success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.

Conclusion: SCRIBE offers a scalable method for improving reasoning and tool-use benchmarks, serving as a complementary pathway alongside low-level tool optimizations.

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

### [13] [Controllable LLM Reasoning via Sparse Autoencoder-Based Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03595)
*Yi Fang,Wenjie Wang,Mingfeng Xue,Boyi Deng,Fengli Xu,Dayiheng Liu,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve and control large reasoning models (LRMs), ensuring accurate and efficient reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often autonomously choose reasoning strategies but may result in inefficient or erroneous paths, necessitating controlled and reliable reasoning.

Method: The authors propose using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle hidden states, followed by SAE-Steering—a feature identification pipeline to control reasoning by selecting strategy-specific features.

Result: SAE-Steering achieves over 15% better control effectiveness and improves accuracy by 7% by redirecting LRMs from flawed reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Controlling fine-grained reasoning strategies in LRMs enhances efficiency and reliability, outperforming existing methods significantly.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

*Chuanliu Fan,Zicheng Ma,Huanran Meng,Aijia Zhang,Wenjie Du,Jun Zhang,Yi Qin Gao,Ziqiang Cao,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PFUA, a domain-specific reasoning agent that uses external tools for protein function prediction, improving upon text-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model reasoning methods are ineffective for protein function understanding due to their reliance on internal reasoning rather than external biological tools.

Method: The paper introduces PFUA, which integrates problem decomposition, tool invocation, and answer generation using domain-specific tools for protein reasoning.

Result: PFUA demonstrated superior performance, outperforming text-only models with an average improvement of 103% across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using domain-specific tools for reasoning offers significant advantages in knowledge-intensive scientific tasks like protein function prediction.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs and Agentic AI systems demands architectural guidelines for creating sophisticated AI systems in enterprise contexts.

Result: The framework enables the expression and verification of organizational, legal, and ethical rules, demonstrated through a clinical trial matching case study.

Conclusion: The proposed architectural approach offers actionable guidance and formal validation capabilities for deploying AI systems in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

### [16] [How Does the Thinking Step Influence Model Safety? An Entropy-based Safety Reminder for LRMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03662)
*Su-Hyeon Kim,Hyundong Jin,Yejin Lee,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SafeRemind, a novel defense mechanism for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that enhances safety by dynamically injecting safe-reminding phrases during the reasoning process, achieving significant safety improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the novel risk introduced by the explicit thinking steps of LRMs, as these steps can amplify unsafe behaviors, and traditional defense mechanisms fail to account for the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs.

Method: The SafeRemind method dynamically inserts safe-reminding phrases using entropy triggers during decision-locking points in the reasoning process of LRMs, ensuring redirection toward safer outcomes without modifying model parameters.

Result: SafeRemind demonstrated a substantial enhancement in LRM safety across five models and six benchmarks, with safety improvements reaching up to 45.5%, while maintaining reasoning capability.

Conclusion: SafeRemind is a simple yet effective decoding-time defense method that promotes LRM safety by utilizing safe-reminders during reasoning, presenting a promising solution for addressing safety risks in these models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

### [17] [Sandwich Reasoning: An Answer-Reasoning-Answer Approach for Low-Latency Query Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03672)
*Chen Zhang,Kepu Zhang,Jiatong Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a faster approach for query correction achieving high accuracy with reduced latency, addressing the limitations of Chain-of-Thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the latency-accuracy trade-off in real-time query correction by reducing reasoning time while maintaining accuracy.

Method: SandwichR combines an initial answer, reasoning, and a final refined answer using consistency-aware reinforcement learning to align corrections and improve accuracy.

Result: SandwichR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reduces latency by 40-70%, outperforming traditional Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Conclusion: SandwichR resolves the latency-accuracy trade-off in query correction, optimizing online search pipelines with real-time and accurate performance.

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

### [18] [Personalized Medication Planning via Direct Domain Modeling and LLM-Generated Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03687)
*Yonatan Vernik,Alexander Tuisov,David Izhaki,Hana Weitman,Gal A. Kaminka,Alexander Shleyfman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing personalized medication planning using problem-specific heuristics generated by Large Language Models, achieving scale and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Initial attempts at automated medication planning were impractical, limited to using up to seven medications, which is insufficient in clinical applications.

Method: The authors specify the domain programmatically and utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate problem-specific heuristics, integrated with a fixed search algorithm (GBFS).

Result: The approach leads to significant improvements, scaling the number of medications planned to at least 28, with better coverage and reduced planning time.

Conclusion: This advancement brings automated personalized medication planning closer to practical applicability in clinical settings.

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

*Zihang Li,Yuhang Wang,Yikun Zong,Wenhan Yu,Xiaokun Yuan,Runhan Jiang,Zirui Liu,Tong Yang,Arthur Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EntroCoT, a framework to enhance Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by filtering low-quality reasoning traces, improving the reliability of fine-tuning datasets for mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of "answer right but reasoning wrong" in datasets for CoT prompting, where intermediate steps are flawed despite correct final answers.

Method: The authors propose a two-step process using entropy-based segmentation and Monte Carlo rollouts to evaluate and filter reasoning steps that contribute to constructing high-quality datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning models on the improved dataset created by EntroCoT yields better performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to full datasets.

Conclusion: EntroCoT successfully refines CoT datasets by detecting and removing flawed reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable fine-tuning and enhanced model performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

*Muyang Zhao,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROI-Reasoning, a framework for large language models (LLMs) to strategically manage computation budgets by predicting task difficulty, cost, and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling LLMs to strategically allocate computation based on task difficulty and global token constraints, optimizing their reasoning under tight computational budgets.

Method: A two-stage framework involving Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning to predict costs/utilities and Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning for strategic token allocation.

Result: ROI-Reasoning demonstrated improved performance and reduced regret in budget-constrained mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances LLMs’ ability to make budget-aware rational decisions, ensuring optimal computation use under constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to compute Rational Closure (RC) using Answer Set Programming (ASP), aiming to improve efficiency and automation in defeasible entailment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implementations of Rational Closure (RC) need more efficient and declarative approaches to enhance entailment checking and model construction.

Method: The authors utilize Answer Set Programming (ASP) to develop a declarative and automated approach for constructing ranked models and checking entailments.

Result: Their ASP-based implementation is proven correct, demonstrates adherence to RC's properties, and enhances computational efficiency compared to existing methods like the InfOCF solver.

Conclusion: The ASP-based methodology for Rational Closure is a theoretically sound and computationally efficient improvement over imperative implementations.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper presents a tool using Answer Set Programming (ASP) to model and interpret articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), supporting decision-making in legal cases with explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assist legal experts during criminal trials by automating the interpretation of ICC articles, simplifying reasoning, and providing explanations for possible legal decisions.

Method: The methodology includes encoding ICC articles in ASP, handling contradictions, validating the model with prior judicial verdicts, and refining as needed. It also employs inductive logic programming to generalize rules from cases.

Result: The developed system generates possible legal decisions and explanations, validated using past verdicts, and provides clarity on the reasoning behind judicial decisions.

Conclusion: This tool enhances legal decision-making processes by combining automated reasoning, explanation generation, and rule learning to improve interpretability in criminal trials.

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

*Akihiro Takemura,Masayuki Otani,Katsumi Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ASP-based method for generating multiple types of logical explanations for decision tree models, focusing on flexibility and effectiveness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting decision tree models, particularly in applications requiring model decision justification, by improving on existing explanation generation techniques.

Method: The authors propose using Answer Set Programming (ASP) to generate sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, offering flexibility and exhaustive enumeration capabilities.

Result: The method was empirically evaluated on diverse datasets and shown to be effective, though with some limitations compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed ASP-based explanation method provides a more flexible and comprehensive means of interpreting decision tree models, holding promise for enhanced applicability in critical domains.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

*Ly Ly Trieu,Tran Cao Son*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces xDNN(ASP), an explanation system generating global logic-based explanations for deep neural networks, bridging the gap between input-output relationships and network structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing explainable AI methods for deep neural networks that focus only on input-output relationships, ignoring the structural aspects of the models.

Method: Propose xDNN(ASP), which extracts a logic program under answer set semantics from neural network models to provide global explanations, connecting the model's structure to its behavior.

Result: Experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets shows that xDNN(ASP) achieves high prediction accuracy and yields insights into feature importance and hidden node impact, useful for network optimization.

Conclusion: xDNN(ASP) provides valuable structural and functional explanations for deep neural networks, enabling optimization and a deeper understanding of the models.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

*Veronika Semmelrock,Gerhard Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines whether Answer Set Programming (ASP) techniques can scale for large configuration problems. The study focuses on grounding issues and proposes a method to reduce memory demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to test if ASP can effectively scale for large configuration challenges, such as those involving electronic systems with more than 30,000 components, and address the grounding bottleneck issue.

Method: The study investigates the incremental solving approach and develops a new method called constraint-aware guessing to reduce memory requirements.

Result: The incremental approach proved effective to some extent but still had significant memory limitations. The constraint-aware guessing method substantially reduced memory needs.

Conclusion: While current ASP techniques have potential, memory constraints remain a challenge. The constraint-aware guessing method shows promise in mitigating this issue.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether agents can effectively use generative world models to enhance their reasoning. It finds that many agents poorly utilize simulation, need mechanisms for better integration of foresight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current vision-language agents in anticipating future states for reasoning, exploring the potential of generative world models as tools to enhance such anticipatory cognition.

Method: The paper conducts empirical evaluations of agents' performance with generative world models across various tasks and analyzes their behavior in invoking, interpreting, and integrating simulation results.

Result: The study finds that agents rarely invoke simulations, often misuse predicted outcomes, and demonstrate inconsistent performance when simulation is enforced. The primary barriers are deciding when and how to simulate effectively.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that enhanced mechanisms are needed to enable agents to strategically and correctly interact with world models, ensuring reliable anticipatory cognition in future systems.

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trade-R1, a framework to mitigate reward hacking in RL applied to financial decision-making by verifying reasoning via retrieval-augmented generation and triangular consistency metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend RL capabilities to financial decision-making, overcoming challenges caused by noisy and stochastic market rewards.

Method: Introduce Trade-R1 framework with a verification method transforming financial reasoning into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation task, incorporating triangular consistency metrics and two reward strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward.

Result: Experiments show reduced reward hacking; Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward enables better cross-market generalization and reasoning consistency.

Conclusion: Trade-R1 effectively addresses challenges in applying RL to stochastic financial markets, with innovations improving reasoning and performance in asset selection tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a method to improve reasoning model efficiency by controlling unnecessary verbosity without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the issue of excessive verbosity in large reasoning models, which increases deployment costs and inefficiently handles simple queries.

Method: Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT) is proposed as a training-time strategy to suppress redundant tokens in model responses, complemented by KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling.

Result: Experimental testing shows DOT improves efficiency and accuracy, with reduced token usage by 78% on AIME-24 benchmarks, beating existing methods.

Conclusion: DOT effectively addresses verbosity issues in reasoning models, pushing the efficiency-performance frontier while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most mobile GUI agents are limited by their reactive nature, relying solely on current screens, hindering their potential in long-term task management.

Method: The paper proposes MobileDreamer, consisting of a textual sketch world model to predict post-action states and a rollout imagination strategy to guide action selection using spatially-aware and efficient learning techniques.

Result: MobileDreamer delivers state-of-the-art results by improving task success by 5.25% in experiments conducted on Android World and accurately forecasting GUI elements.

Conclusion: MobileDreamer enhances the decision-making capabilities of mobile GUI agents, demonstrating both improved task success and effective future imagination capabilities for long-horizon applications.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality.

Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundational framework for understanding and combating agent drift, improving long-term reliability and safety in multi-agent LLM systems during enterprise applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

### [32] [Bare-Metal Tensor Virtualization: Overcoming the Memory Wall in Edge-AI Inference on ARM64](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03324)
*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a software-based "Virtual Tensor Core" optimized for ARM64 processors to address memory-related latency issues, achieving efficient and open inference on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the memory wall bottleneck in deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices, avoiding inefficiencies caused by high-level abstractions and memory access overhead.

Method: Implemented a novel Virtual Tensor Core architecture using 'Software-Defined DMA,' custom NEON SIMD kernels, Tensor Virtualization Layout for efficient memory utilization, and zero-copy loading for ARM64 microarchitectures.

Result: Achieved >60 tokens/second inference throughput on M2 hardware with a 110M parameter model, meeting psycholinguistic latency thresholds using open and portable optimizations.

Conclusion: The proposed open and deterministic software solution efficiently addresses memory bottlenecks on general-purpose ARM processors, providing a new reference for memory-efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

*Shuo Lu,Yinuo Xu,Jianjie Cheng,Lingxiao He,Meng Wang,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the retrieval-utilization gap in deep research agents and proposes the DeepResearch-Slice framework to improve evidence utilization and reasoning in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of current retrieval models, which fail to effectively utilize retrieved evidence due to context blindness in noisy environments.

Method: The authors introduce DeepResearch-Slice, a neuro-symbolic framework that predicts precise span indices for deterministic hard filtering before reasoning, enhancing robustness without modifying frozen backbones.

Result: Across six benchmarks, DeepResearch-Slice shows a 73% relative improvement in evidence utilization, enhancing reasoning accuracy from 19.1% to 33.0% by mitigating noise effectively.

Conclusion: Explicit grounding mechanisms like the proposed framework are critical to improving robustness in open-ended research tasks involving noisy environments.

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

### [34] [Internal Reasoning vs. External Control: A Thermodynamic Analysis of Sycophancy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03263)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines sycophancy in large language models, comparing internal reasoning mechanisms with external regulatory methods, and finds external constraints necessary for eliminating sycophancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of sycophancy in language models, where they prioritize user agreeableness over factual correctness.

Method: The authors use the CAP-GSM8K adversarial dataset to assess internal mechanisms (Chain of Thought reasoning) versus external regulatory mechanisms (Regulated Coherence Analysis) on models GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1.

Result: Internal reasoning methods lead to performance collapse in weaker models and a residual output gap in frontier models. On the other hand, external constraints eliminate sycophancy across model tiers.

Conclusion: External structural constraints are essential to ensure safety and optimal performance in language models, as internal reasoning alone is insufficient to mitigate sycophancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models frequently exhibit sycophancy, prioritizing user agreeableness over correctness. We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.

*Kai Hu,Abhinav Aggarwal,Mehran Khodabandeh,David Zhang,Eric Hsin,Li Chen,Ankit Jain,Matt Fredrikson,Akash Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a policy-based red teaming methodology for large language models (LLMs) that generates diverse and effective adversarial prompts to identify safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations rely on example-based approaches, which limit policy coverage and attack diversity, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Jailbreak-Zero uses an attack LLM to generate diverse adversarial prompts, fine-tuned with a preference dataset, to optimize policy coverage, attack diversity, and prompt fidelity.

Result: Empirical evidence shows Jailbreak-Zero achieves higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary LLMs like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Jailbreak-Zero methodology is scalable, effective, and human-readable, addressing safety vulnerabilities in LLMs with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

### [36] [Benchmarking and Adapting On-Device Large Language Models for Clinical Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03266)
*Alif Munim,Jun Ma,Omar Ibrahim,Alhusain Abdalla,Shuolin Yin,Leo Chen,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates smaller, open-source, on-device LLMs for clinical tasks, showing they rival proprietary and larger models while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and resource limitations in clinical settings by exploring smaller, open-source LLMs for local inference of clinical tasks.

Method: The paper benchmarks two on-device LLMs (gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b) against proprietary and open-source models in three clinical scenarios, including fine-tuning for diagnostic improvement.

Result: gpt-oss models perform comparably or better than larger systems despite smaller sizes, and fine-tuning boosts their accuracy to nearing GPT-5 levels.

Conclusion: On-device LLMs can provide adaptable, accurate, and privacy-preserving solutions for clinical decision support, enabling broader clinical integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.

### [37] [A path to natural language through tokenisation and transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03368)
*David S. Berman,Alexander G. Stapleton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between natural language statistical regularities, such as Zipf's and Heaps' laws, and contemporary tokenization schemes like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), revealing that BPE influences corpus statistics and model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap in understanding how modern tokenization schemes (e.g., BPE) relate to the inherent statistical properties of natural languages, such as Zipf’s law, and their implications for language models.

Method: The authors derive a mathematical expression for slot entropy under Zipfian frequency assumptions, analyze corpora transformed by BPE empirically, and conduct experiments with language models trained on data tokenized at varying BPE depths. Attention diagnostics are also employed.

Result: The study finds that BPE drives token frequencies toward Zipfian distributions and induces characteristic entropy growth patterns. Language models trained on deeply tokenized data exhibit predictive entropies that better align with Zipf-derived expectations, with reduced local token dependencies.

Conclusion: BPE not only serves as a compression tool but also reconstructs critical informational properties of natural language, optimizing tokenization for contemporary transformer modeling.

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to design a more efficient, safer, and useful AI system that addresses previous limitations such as hallucinations and sycophancy, while excelling in real-world applications.

Method: GPT-5 uses a combination of a fast model, a deeper reasoning model, and a real-time router to optimize response quality and efficiency based on task complexity and intent. User feedback and usage data continuously train the system for improvements.

Result: GPT-5 achieves significantly better benchmark performance, faster response times, and improved utility for real-world applications. It also features substantial advancements in safety and instruction following.

Conclusion: GPT-5 represents a milestone in multimodal AI systems, excelling in utility, performance, and safety, particularly in writing, coding, and health-related tasks. Precautionary safety measures were also taken in high-risk domains like biology and chemistry.

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

TL;DR: This paper highlights the underappreciated effectiveness of Small Language Models (SLMs) in practical, non-reasoning tasks like tone modification, and proposes a tailored evaluation framework for these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and problem-solving tasks, Small Language Models (SLMs) are often undervalued despite their utility in common industrial applications like tone adjustment.

Method: The authors propose a specialized evaluation framework for SLMs, combining new methods in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation, to highlight their capabilities in non-reasoning tasks.

Result: The framework successfully showcases the potential of SLMs in task-specific fine-tuning for practical applications, providing better benchmarking tools for comparing SLMs and LLMs.

Conclusion: SLMs, though smaller compared to LLMs, are effective and valuable for specific industrial tasks. The developed framework ensures their efficient benchmarking, especially relevant for edge and private computing contexts.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

Conclusion: The paper identifies an 'instruction gap' in LLMs, emphasizing their struggle to meet precise instruction-following needs in enterprise contexts while providing benchmarks for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

TL;DR: The paper presents a history-free test set compression framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce redundancy and computational costs in evaluation benchmarks without requiring prior model history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation benchmarks for LLMs in specialized domains suffer from semantic redundancy and high computational costs, particularly posing challenges in cold-start scenarios with no previous model evaluation history.

Method: The framework fine-tunes an LLM using minimal domain-specific data, generates embeddings for test samples, performs task-aware clustering, and uses a dataset X-ray mechanism to calibrate compression intensity based on benchmark redundancy.

Result: The method demonstrates over 90% reduction in evaluation cost while maintaining high fidelity to the full benchmark, as validated on a large-scale 3GPP communications dataset.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient, history-free solution for compressing test sets in specialized domains, addressing redundancy and computational expense effectively.

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

### [43] [GuardEval: A Multi-Perspective Benchmark for Evaluating Safety, Fairness, and Robustness in LLM Moderators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03273)
*Naseem Machlovi,Maryam Saleki,Ruhul Amin,Mohamed Rahouti,Shawqi Al-Maliki,Junaid Qadir,Mohamed M. Abdallah,Ala Al-Fuqaha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GuardEval, a detailed benchmark dataset, and GemmaGuard (GGuard), a fine-tuned language model for safer moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for enhanced moderation techniques is driven by the limitations of current LLMs in handling nuanced harmful content and biases, which persist due to reliance on training data and subjective issues.

Method: The study introduces GuardEval, a multi-perspective benchmark dataset with 106 categories, and develops GemmaGuard (GGuard), leveraging QLoRA fine-tuning on this dataset.

Result: GemmaGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, significantly outperforming existing moderation models like OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61).

Conclusion: Multi-perspective safety benchmarks like GuardEval, combined with representative data exemplified in GGuard, lead to better moderation performance and mitigate biases and inconsistencies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

### [45] [Topic Segmentation Using Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03276)
*Pierre Mackenzie,Maya Shah,Patrick Frenett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for topic segmentation, employing a recursive prompting and sentence enumeration strategy. It suggests LLMs could outperform traditional methods but identifies unresolved challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous topic segmentation approaches rely on semantic similarity, which lacks long-range dependencies and knowledge inherent in LLMs.

Method: An overlapping and recursive prompting strategy along with sentence enumeration to utilize LLMs effectively for topic segmentation.

Result: The study finds LLMs can surpass existing methods in segmentation effectiveness but highlights issues that need resolution.

Conclusion: While LLMs show potential in topic segmentation, further improvements are required to ensure their reliability for this task.

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

*Zhibo Hu,Chen Wang,Yanfeng Shu,Hye-young Paik,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how metaphors in training data affect large language models' reasoning misalignment across domains, finding a causal connection and proposing a detector for misaligned content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether metaphors in LLMs' training data influence reasoning pathways and contribute to cross-domain reasoning misalignments.

Method: The authors analyzed the causal relationship between metaphors and reasoning misalignment, conducted interventions in pre-training, fine-tuning, and re-alignment, and monitored latent features for patterns.

Result: The study found that metaphors have a strong causal connection with reasoning misalignment, and interventions significantly affect misalignment degrees. They also developed a detector leveraging latent features to identify misaligned content with high accuracy.

Conclusion: Metaphors play a significant role in influencing LLMs' reasoning misalignment, but by monitoring latent features and incorporating careful interventions, such misalignments can be detected and potentially mitigated.

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

*Maan Qraitem,Kate Saenko,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses biases in procedural character generation methods and proposes PersonaWeaver, a tool for creating more diverse and dynamic virtual characters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current character generation techniques tend to produce predictable characters due to biases like moral conformity and helpfulness, which hinder dramatic tension and character diversity.

Method: PersonaWeaver separates world-building attributes (roles, demographics) from behavioral attributes (moral stances, interaction styles), promoting nuanced character generation.

Result: The framework creates characters with greater diversity in moral stances, interactional styles, and stylistic markers (e.g., tone and punctuation).

Conclusion: PersonaWeaver enhances character generation for virtual worlds by addressing alignment-induced biases, thus fostering creative and engaging narratives.

Abstract: Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Disclaimer Injection to protect data from unauthorized learning by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the unauthorized use of proprietary or personal data in the training of large language models.

Method: Disclaimer Injection incorporates alignment-triggering disclaimers into the data, exploiting the models' alignment mechanisms to hinder effective learning.

Result: The protected data induces systematic performance degradation in models, as alignment-related layers persistently override task learning.

Conclusion: This method offers a practical approach to make data unlearnable at LLM scale without needing access to the training pipeline or modifying the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, heterogeneous text corpora, raising serious concerns about the unauthorised use of proprietary or personal data during model training. In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computational resources for Tigrinya number verbalization.

Method: Documenting canonical rules, developing a formal algorithm, and providing open-source implementation.

Result: Large language models show gaps in processing Tigrinya numbers accurately.

Conclusion: Rule formalization enhances Tigrinya language applications in modeling, speech synthesis, and accessibility.

Abstract: We present a systematic formalization of Tigrinya cardinal and ordinal number verbalization, addressing a gap in computational resources for the language. This work documents the canonical rules governing the expression of numerical values in spoken Tigrinya, including the conjunction system, scale words, and special cases for dates, times, and currency. We provide a formal algorithm for number-to-word conversion and release an open-source implementation. Evaluation of frontier large language models (LLMs) reveals significant gaps in their ability to accurately verbalize Tigrinya numbers, underscoring the need for explicit rule documentation. This work serves language modeling, speech synthesis, and accessibility applications targeting Tigrinya-speaking communities.

### [50] [Implicit Graph, Explicit Retrieval: Towards Efficient and Interpretable Long-horizon Memory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03417)
*Xin Zhang,Kailai Yang,Hao Li,Chenyue Li,Qiyu Wei,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentGraphMem is a hybrid memory framework designed to efficiently handle long-context applications by combining graph-structured latent memory and explicit subgraph retrieval for better performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of answering queries in long-horizon scenarios where evidence is sparse and spread across extensive contexts, something current memory paradigms struggle with.

Method: LatentGraphMem creates a latent graph memory for efficient operations and stability, while introducing task-specific subgraph retrieval for improved interpretability and reasoning supervision.

Result: LatentGraphMem outperforms existing memory paradigms in long-horizon benchmarks and adapts effectively to various model scales without adding excessive symbolic complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates enhanced performance, adaptability, and the ability to scale efficiently, making it suitable for applications requiring extended reasoning over long contexts.

Abstract: Long-horizon applications increasingly require large language models (LLMs) to answer queries when relevant evidence is sparse and dispersed across very long contexts. Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCoA, a benchmark for verifying medical summaries with detailed phrase-level context attribution. It also proposes an evaluation framework and validates its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the verification of system-generated medical summaries by ensuring precise attribution to source context, addressing the challenges in high-stakes medical domains.

Method: Researchers introduce PCoA, a benchmark aligning summaries with contextual evidence at the phrase level, and propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to independently assess summary quality and context attribution.

Result: Experiments validate PCoA's utility as a reliable benchmark and show that identifying relevant context before summarization improves quality. Benchmarking results for large language models are also presented.

Conclusion: PCoA provides a consistent and reliable benchmark for phrase-level attribution in medical summarization tasks, and pre-identifying context enhances summary quality.

Abstract: Verifying system-generated summaries remains challenging, as effective verification requires precise attribution to the source context, which is especially crucial in high-stakes medical domains. To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that explicitly identifying relevant sentences and contributory phrases before summarization can improve overall quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAPT, a novel model-ensembling method for adapting general-domain language models to the clinical domain without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt state-of-the-art general-domain language models to clinical tasks without incurring costly retraining for every new model generation.

Method: The authors propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), which uses contrastive decoding to combine signals from existing clinical models into general-domain models, preserving reasoning and fluency.

Result: CAPT consistently outperforms individual models and existing ensembling methods across six clinical tasks, providing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: CAPT effectively adapts general-domain models for clinical applications, offering training-free model improvement while enhancing clinical specificity and reducing errors.

Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.

### [53] [The Critical Role of Aspects in Measuring Document Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03435)
*Eftekhar Hossain,Tarnika Hazra,Ahatesham Bhuiyan,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASPECTSIM, a framework for measuring document similarity conditioned on specific aspects, contrasting traditional holistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on holistic approaches for document similarity, missing the importance of specific aspects.

Method: ASPECTSIM uses conditioning on specified aspects and conducts experiments using GPT-4o, smaller open-source models, and embeddings with a benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs.

Result: ASPECTSIM with GPT-4o achieves 80% higher human-machine agreement compared to traditional methods. Smaller LLMs, even with refinements, significantly underperform in comparison.

Conclusion: Explicit aspect conditioning improves document similarity measurement, but there is a noticeable gap in effectiveness between large proprietary models and smaller open-source models.

Abstract: We introduce ASPECTSIM, a simple and interpretable framework that requires conditioning document similarity on an explicitly specified aspect, which is different from the traditional holistic approach in measuring document similarity. Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\approx$140%. Nevertheless, agreement remains well below that of GPT-4o-based models, indicating that smaller open-source LLMs still lag behind large proprietary models in capturing aspect-conditioned similarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the choice of grading scale in large language model evaluations affects consistency and agreement between human and LLM ratings, finding variations across tasks and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing reliance on LLMs for autonomous evaluations, understanding their consistency and alignment with human judgment is crucial for reliable performance.

Method: The study compares LLM and human evaluations across three grading scales (including 0-5) on six benchmarks containing objective, subjective, and mixed tasks, measuring agreement using intraclass correlation coefficients.

Result: Findings reveal LLMs are inconsistent across scales in subjective benchmarks with scale design affecting human-LLM alignment. The 0-5 scale showed the highest alignment while pooled reliability hides subgroup diagnostic differences.

Conclusion: Scale design and subgroup-specific analyses are critical to improving the reliability and fairness of LLM judgments, making these elements essential in scaling LLMs as evaluators.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

*Atsuki Yamaguchi,Maggie Mi,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the L2T framework, which enhances language models by integrating structured language learning tasks into the pre-training process, improving linguistic competence and general reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models excel in generating sequences and reasoning but lack explicit optimization for linguistic competence. The paper addresses this limitation.

Method: The researchers propose a framework named L2T, transforming raw text into structured input-output pairs for language learning tasks, combined with standard token prediction in pre-training.

Result: L2T pre-trained models show improved linguistic competence and faster acquisition, while retaining strong performance on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating structured language learning tasks during pre-training makes language models more linguistically competent without compromising reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on raw text datasets to generate text sequences token-by-token. While this approach facilitates the learning of world knowledge and reasoning, it does not explicitly optimize for linguistic competence. To bridge this gap, we propose L2T, a pre-training framework integrating Language Learning Tasks alongside standard next-token prediction. Inspired by human language acquisition, L2T transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. Pre-training LMs on a mixture of raw text and L2T data not only improves overall performance on linguistic competence benchmarks but accelerates its acquisition, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

*Dan Schumacher,Erfan Nourbakhsh,Rocky Slavin,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the belief that LLMs perform poorly at time series classification by showing that limitations of prompt-based evaluation, rather than the models themselves, lead to this underestimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address doubts regarding whether LLMs can encode meaningful temporal structure for time series classification and scrutinize the reliability of prompt-based evaluations.

Method: The authors use linear probes to analyze internal representations of LLMs and compare their results with prompt-based outputs. They perform layer-wise analysis to evaluate how class-discriminative time series information develops within the transformer architecture.

Result: Linear probes outperform zero-shot prompt evaluations in time series classification, revealing that LLMs can match or exceed specialized time series models. Time series information becomes discriminative in earlier transformer layers and improves with visual or multimodal inputs.

Conclusion: Prompt-based evaluations systematically underestimate LLMs' capabilities in understanding time series, as LLMs internally encode significant temporal information that is revealed by alternative methods like linear probing.

Abstract: Prompt-based evaluations suggest that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on time series classification, raising doubts about whether they encode meaningful temporal structure. We show that this conclusion reflects limitations of prompt-based generation rather than the model's representational capacity by directly comparing prompt outputs with linear probes over the same internal representations. While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs. Together, these results demonstrate a systematic mismatch between what LLMs internally represent and what prompt-based evaluation reveals, leading current evaluations to underestimate their time series understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EpiQAL is introduced as the first benchmark for assessing epidemiological question answering, showing that current language models struggle with multi-step inference and evidence-grounded reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in systematic evaluation tools for evidence-grounded epidemiological inference and question answering, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning.

Method: Three subsets of EpiQAL were constructed using expert-designed taxonomy, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. These subsets evaluate factual recall, multi-step inference, and conclusion reconstruction in epidemiology.

Result: Experiments with ten open models reveal limited performance, particularly on multi-step inference. Performance rankings differed across subsets, and scaling models does not guarantee success. Chain-of-Thought prompting had mixed effects.

Conclusion: EpiQAL serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, highlighting LLMs' current limitations in epidemiological reasoning and providing insights for areas of improvement.

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

*José Isidro,Filipe Cunha,Purificação Silvano,Alípio Jorge,Nuno Guimarães,Sérgio Nunes,Ricardo Campos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SegNSP, an approach to linear text segmentation using next sentence prediction (NSP) without explicit topic labels, achieving competitive results on datasets CitiLink-Minutes and WikiSection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear text segmentation is challenging due to issues with defining topic boundaries, variable discourse structure, and balancing local coherence with global context, which impacts tasks like summarization and question answering.

Method: The paper proposes SegNSP, which reframes text segmentation as an NSP task. It uses a label-agnostic approach for predicting sentence continuity, incorporating segmentation-aware loss and harder negative sampling to enhance coherence detection.

Result: SegNSP achieves a B-F1 score of 0.79 on CitiLink-Minutes and 0.65 on WikiSection, outperforming existing baselines like TopSeg by 0.17 points on WikiSection, showing competitive performance.

Conclusion: Modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity via SegNSP improves segmentation quality and supports NLP tasks without requiring explicit topic labels or task-specific supervision.

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMRA, a self-explaining hate speech detection framework that aligns model attention with moral rationales using Moral Foundations Theory, and presents a new annotated dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hate speech detection models overly rely on surface-level lexical features, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and lacking robustness, cultural contextualization, and interpretability.

Method: SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision based on Moral Foundations Theory directly into its training to guide the model's attention to morally significant text spans, reducing dependence on spurious patterns.

Result: SMRA outperforms baseline models in performance metrics (e.g., F1 scores) and explanation faithfulness while maintaining fairness and sufficiency in rationales.

Conclusion: Incorporating moral rationale supervision enhances hate speech detection performance and interpretability, with SMRA offering more robust and contextually meaningful explanations.

Abstract: Hate speech detection models rely on surface-level lexical features, increasing vulnerability to spurious correlations and limiting robustness, cultural contextualization, and interpretability. We propose Supervised Moral Rationale Attention (SMRA), the first self-explaining hate speech detection framework to incorporate moral rationales as direct supervision for attention alignment. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp). Although explanations become more concise, sufficiency improves (+2.3 pp) and fairness remains stable, indicating more faithful rationales without performance or bias trade-offs

### [60] [CALM: Culturally Self-Aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03483)
*Lingzhi Shen,Xiaohao Cai,Yunfei Long,Imran Razzak,Guanming Chen,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM is a new framework for making language models culturally self-aware, enabling better cultural sensitivity through dynamic adaptation and reflective learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultural understanding in language models is often static, leading to reduced reliability in tasks needing cultural sensitivity. This paper aims to address this limitation by providing a dynamic approach to cultural awareness.

Method: CALM employs contrastive learning to form structured cultural clusters and aligns them with cross-attention. These clusters are integrated using a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism across culture-specific dimensions and enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning.

Result: CALM consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CALM framework makes language models culturally self-aware, enabling better handling of dynamic cultural contexts and achieving superior performance in culturally sensitive tasks.

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [61] [Submodular Evaluation Subset Selection in Automatic Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03493)
*Jinming Nian,Zhiyuan Peng,Hongwei Shang,Dae Hoon Park,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies evaluation subset selection for automatic prompt optimization and introduces SESS, a principled submodular selection method, improving prompt quality compared to random baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on small, often randomly chosen evaluation subsets for feedback in prompt optimization, but the selection of these subsets is often overlooked despite its importance.

Method: The authors propose SESS, which frames evaluation subset selection as maximizing a submodular, monotone objective set function, allowing for greedy selection with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Using SESS on datasets like GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond yields better optimized prompts compared to random or heuristic selection methods.

Conclusion: Evaluating with submodularly selected subsets enhances prompt optimization and outperforms traditional random or heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual prompt engineering, but relies on task performance measured on a small, often randomly sampled evaluation subset as its main source of feedback signal. Despite this, how to select that evaluation subset is usually treated as an implementation detail. We study evaluation subset selection for prompt optimization from a principled perspective and propose SESS, a submodular evaluation subset selection method. We frame selection as maximizing an objective set function and show that, under mild conditions, it is monotone and submodular, enabling greedy selection with theoretical guarantees. Across GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond, submodularly selected evaluation subsets can yield better optimized prompts than random or heuristic baselines.

### [62] [Beyond Perplexity: A Lightweight Benchmark for Knowledge Retention in Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03505)
*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a new evaluation method (Knowledge Retention Test) to better assess factual learning during large language model fine-tuning by using contrastive examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of validating domain-specific fine-tuning in language models, where existing methods fail to differentiate between linguistic mimicry and true factual learning.

Method: The proposed KR-Test involves generating contrastive examples to measure a model's factual correctness without requiring additional instruction tuning or generative decoding.

Result: The KR-Test successfully exposes distinctions between linguistic adjustments and factual knowledge during fine-tuning, and its reliability is established through benchmark analyses.

Conclusion: KR-Test improves the understanding of training dynamics by offering a refined method to evaluate factual knowledge retention separate from purely stylistic adjustments.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

### [63] [Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging for Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03506)
*Zhaofeng Zhong,Wei Yuan,Tong Chen,Xiangyu Zhao,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM) to merge long and short reasoning models for efficient query-adaptive reasoning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models often incur high computational costs and latency by generating unnecessarily long reasoning paths for every query. Existing solutions are expensive or highly sensitive to input settings, motivating the need for a lightweight alternative.

Method: The authors propose a layer-wise model merging framework (RPAM) where reasoning models are combined adaptively based on reasoning patterns. This involves using a pattern-labeled calibration set and optimizing merging coefficients through feature alignment and contrastive objectives.

Result: RPAM achieves significant inference cost reduction while maintaining high performance on seven reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Model merging using RPAM offers an efficient and practical alternative to retraining or complex prompting approaches, balancing computational efficiency and strong querying performance.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

### [64] [IntroLM: Introspective Language Models via Prefilling-Time Self-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03511)
*Hossein Hosseini Kasnavieh,Gholamreza Haffari,Chris Leckie,Adel N. Toosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntroLM allows language models to predict their output quality without external evaluation, enhancing efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of assessing the quality of language model outputs without relying on external evaluators, which have limitations in scope and computational demands.

Method: IntroLM introduces introspective tokens and token conditional LoRA, enabling the language model to evaluate its answer quality during the prefilling phase without altering generative behavior.

Result: IntroLM significantly improves success prediction (ROC AUC of 90%) and outperforms external classifiers; it reduces system latency by 33% and large-model usage by half while maintaining reliability.

Conclusion: IntroLM offers an effective, efficient, and integrated approach to self-assessments of language model output, promising enhancements in cost-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

### [65] [Mem-Gallery: Benchmarking Multimodal Long-Term Conversational Memory for MLLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03515)
*Yuanchen Bei,Tianxin Wei,Xuying Ning,Yanjun Zhao,Zhining Liu,Xiao Lin,Yada Zhu,Hendrik Hamann,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mem-Gallery introduces a groundbreaking benchmark to evaluate multimodal long-term conversational memory in multimodal large language models (MLLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess how multimodal conversations evolve across longer interaction horizons; thus, there was a need for a rigorous evaluation of memory capabilities in such settings.

Method: Mem-Gallery provides a new dataset featuring rich multimodal dependencies and high-quality multi-session conversations, accompanied by a systematic evaluation framework focusing on memory extraction, reasoning, and knowledge management.

Result: Testing across thirteen memory systems revealed gaps in memory reasoning, knowledge management, efficient retention, and organization of multimodal information.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of explicit multimodal memory retention and organization, while revealing inefficiencies and limitations within current model architectures.

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

*Yuwen Wang,Xinyuan Qian,Tian-Hao Zhang,Jiaran Gao,Yuchen Pan,Xin Wang,Zhou Pan,Chen Wei,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Large Audio-Language Models (PALM) to incorporate personal context in audio understanding and reasoning, introducing a benchmark and evaluating current strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large audio-language models excel in general audio processing but lack the ability for personalized question answering, highlighting the need for models that can integrate individual personal contexts.

Method: The authors formalize the Personalized LALMs task, develop the PALM-Bench benchmark for structured evaluation, and conduct extensive experiments with existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques.

Result: Experiments showed that while prompting and fine-tuning strategies enhance performance, they are still insufficient in robustly transferring personalized knowledge across tasks.

Conclusion: More sophisticated methods are essential for effectively modeling and transferring personal knowledge within large audio-language models. Data and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in audio understanding and generation. Yet, our extensive benchmarking reveals that their behavior is largely generic (e.g., summarizing spoken content) and fails to adequately support personalized question answering (e.g., summarizing what my best friend says). In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly. Data and code will be released.

*Yilong Dai,Ziyi Wang,Chenguang Wang,Kexin Zhou,Yiheng Qian,Susu Xu,Xiang Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Vision-Language Model framework for assessing bikeability, integrating user perceptions and providing explainable assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create safer and more cyclist-friendly urban environments by addressing limitations in current perception-based bikeability assessment methods.

Method: The framework uses persona-aware conditioning, multi-granularity fine-tuning, and AI-driven data augmentation with crowdsourced panoramic image-based assessments from 427 cyclists.

Result: The framework provides competitive bikeability prediction and allows for explainable analysis of influencing factors.

Conclusion: The study advances bikeability assessment methodologies by offering a novel, explainable, and user-centered approach focused on cyclist perceptions.

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark for objectively assessing the information consolidation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating coherent, long-form outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate the synthesis capabilities of LLMs, which are crucial for creating structured, coherent reports from fragmented information, and addressing the lack of benchmarks for open-ended, subjective writing.

Method: The authors created DeepSynth-Eval, leveraging survey papers as benchmarks, and introduced checklists for factual and structural evaluations (General and Constraint Checklists). They tested it on 96 tasks and compared single-turn generation methods with agentic workflows.

Result: The study finds that synthesizing information from large datasets remains challenging for LLMs, with agentic workflows outperforming single-turn approaches in reducing hallucinations and improving structural adherence.

Conclusion: Effective synthesis of information by LLMs requires agentic workflows rather than single-turn generation for better coherence, reduced hallucinations, and adherence to structural complexity.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards autonomous agents has catalyzed progress in Deep Research. While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing "Oracle Contexts" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints.

*Xukai Liu,Ye Liu,Jipeng Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Kai Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) perform multi-hop reasoning and identifies layer-order inversion, a deviation from the hop-aligned circuit hypothesis. The authors introduce a probabilistic recall-and-extract framework to explain these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and better understand how LLMs internally perform multi-hop reasoning and challenge the hop-aligned circuit hypothesis.

Method: The authors conducted systematic analyses of real-world multi-hop queries, reinterpreted prior layer-wise decoding evidence, and developed the probabilistic recall-and-extract framework to model LLM behavior.

Result: They discovered a phenomenon called layer-order inversion, where later-hop answers appear earlier than bridge entities, validated the proposed framework, and provided insights into multi-hop reasoning and its failures.

Conclusion: The study challenges the hop-aligned circuit hypothesis, proposing a probabilistic recall-and-extract framework to better explain LLM reasoning processes and diagnose their limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/laquabe/Layer-Order-Inversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation for LLMs on diverse memory dimensions, particularly in multi-session conversational contexts.

Method: The authors designed EvolMem, grounded in cognitive psychology, covering declarative and non-declarative memory abilities. They used a hybrid data synthesis framework for creating scalable multi-session conversations and evaluation guidelines.

Result: Evaluation showed no LLM consistently excelled across all memory dimensions, and agent memory mechanisms had limited impact and efficiency shortcomings.

Conclusion: EvolMem highlights gaps in LLM multi-session memory capacities, establishing a foundation for future advancements and evaluations in this area.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding and leveraging long-range conversational memory, existing benchmarks still lack systematic evaluation of large language models(LLMs) across diverse memory dimensions, particularly in multi-session settings. In this work, we propose EvolMem, a new benchmark for assessing multi-session memory capabilities of LLMs and agent systems. EvolMem is grounded in cognitive psychology and encompasses both declarative and non-declarative memory, further decomposed into multiple fine-grained abilities. To construct the benchmark, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that consists of topic-initiated generation and narrative-inspired transformations. This framework enables scalable generation of multi-session conversations with controllable complexity, accompanied by sample-specific evaluation guidelines. Extensive evaluation reveals that no LLM consistently outperforms others across all memory dimensions. Moreover, agent memory mechanisms do not necessarily enhance LLMs' capabilities and often exhibit notable efficiency limitations. Data and code will be released at https://github.com/shenye7436/EvolMem.

TL;DR: This paper explores the decision-making simulation of LLMs on personal data-sharing tasks focusing on their privacy and prosocial motivations, measuring alignment between attitudes and actual behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) balance privacy concerns and prosocial motivations when simulating data-sharing decisions, reflecting human-like behavior.

Method: Introduced a context-based protocol with standardized questionnaires, analyzed value-action alignment through Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling (MGSEM) and proposed the Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR) metric.

Result: LLMs exhibit stable but model-specific profiles regarding privacy and sharing attitudes, with significant variability in their alignment between expressed values and actions.

Conclusion: The findings underline the diversity among LLMs in simulating human-like trade-offs between privacy and prosocial behavior, offering avenues for improving privacy-conscious AI decision-makers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

TL;DR: The paper assesses the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations, introducing a systematic PAS framework for evaluation and highlighting areas where LLMs underperform in police-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of LLMs in police operations necessitates a reliable evaluation framework, as unverified use can lead to legal and operational risks, such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence management.

Method: The authors developed a Police Action Scenarios (PAS) framework and a novel QA dataset based on over 8,000 official documents, then validated key metrics through statistical analyses with police expert judgments.

Result: Experimentation revealed that existing commercial LLMs perform poorly on police-specific tasks, especially in providing fact-based recommendations.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of a scalable evaluation framework for ensuring safe and reliable AI applications in police environments, releasing data and a prompt template for future development.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

TL;DR: DiffCoT enhances multi-step mathematical problem-solving in large language models by introducing a diffusion-style framework for iterative denoising of reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of exposure bias and error accumulation in Chain-of-Thought reasoning with autoregressive language models.

Method: DiffCoT employs a diffusion-styled framework using a sliding-window mechanism for iterative correction of intermediate reasoning steps, coupled with a causal diffusion noise schedule for maintaining temporal consistency.

Result: Testing on three CoT benchmarks across diverse model backbones showed that DiffCoT outperformed existing optimization methods in robustness and error-correction.

Conclusion: DiffCoT improves the robustness and accuracy of CoT reasoning, offering a novel iterative correction framework for better problem-solving performance in language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves multi-step mathematical problem solving in large language models but remains vulnerable to exposure bias and error accumulation, as early mistakes propagate irreversibly through autoregressive decoding. In this work, we propose DiffCoT, a diffusion-styled CoT framework that reformulates CoT reasoning as an iterative denoising process. DiffCoT integrates diffusion principles at the reasoning-step level via a sliding-window mechanism, enabling unified generation and retrospective correction of intermediate steps while preserving token-level autoregression. To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.

*Barry Menglong Yao,Sha Li,Yunzhi Yao,Minqian Liu,Zaishuo Xia,Qifan Wang,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes how large language models (LLMs) learn, retain, forget, and interact with concepts, linking findings to Concept Circuits and their structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs acquire, retain, and forget concepts during their ongoing training to improve their robustness and interpretability.

Method: This paper uses Concept Circuits and Graph Metrics to examine learning dynamics, focusing on temporal patterns, interference, synergy, forgetfulness, and transferability.

Result: Findings include statistically significant concept learning patterns, patterns of concept acquisition and stabilization, larger learning gains linked to greater forgetting, interference among semantically similar concepts, and varying transferability of conceptual knowledge.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into concept-level learning in LLMs, offering guidance for designing better concept-aware training strategies.

Abstract: Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsychEthicsBench, a benchmark rooted in Australian psychology guidelines, to evaluate ethical and behavioral responses of language models in mental health contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating the safety alignment of large language models in mental health applications rely heavily on refusal-based metrics, which fail to address nuanced clinical behaviors and can lead to unempathetic and harmful outcomes.

Method: The authors developed PsychEthicsBench, a benchmark utilizing both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks, annotated with fine-grained ethicality metrics, based on psychological and psychiatric guidelines.

Result: Empirical analysis of 14 models reveals that refusal rates inadequately reflect ethical behavior and that fine-tuning domain-specific models can degrade their ethical alignment compared to their base counterparts.

Conclusion: PsychEthicsBench sets a foundation for jurisdiction-aware, systematic evaluation of LLMs in mental health, to foster more responsible and clinically appropriate AI development.

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into mental health applications necessitates robust frameworks for evaluating professional safety alignment. Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment.

### [76] [OLA: Output Language Alignment in Code-Switched LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03589)
*Juhyun Oh,Haneul Yoo,Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inability of current LLMs to align output language to user expectations during code-switching, introduces the OLA benchmark for evaluation, and proposes improved alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual users naturally code-switch in prompts, but existing LLMs fail to infer the intended response language based on contextual cues, leading to user dissatisfaction.

Method: The authors introduced OLA, a benchmark to evaluate output language alignment during Korean-English code-switching scenarios, analyzed biases across different language pairs, and explored solutions like Code-Switching Aware DPO.

Result: Even state-of-the-art models struggle with implicit language expectations and exhibit biases, errors like language intrusions and instability. A fine-tuning approach (DPO) with limited data greatly improves alignment.

Conclusion: Better alignment strategies are needed for multilingual LLMs, as these failures stem from insufficient training rather than inherent limitations.

Abstract: Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

### [77] [From Chains to Graphs: Self-Structured Reasoning for General-Domain LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03597)
*Yingjian Chen,Haoran Liu,Yinhong Liu,Sherry T. Tong,Aosong Feng,Jinghui Lu,Juntao Zhang,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo,Irene Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework for improving reasoning consistency in large language models by enabling them to represent their reasoning processes as structured graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs perform well on open-domain question answering, their reasoning is often linear and logically inconsistent, unlike real-world parallel reasoning integrating multiple premises. Current methods like Chain-of-Thought do not address this issue effectively.

Method: SGR facilitates structured graph representations for reasoning in LLMs and trains models using a specialized dataset with merged reasoning graphs. The framework explicitly constructs reasoning graphs before forming final answers.

Result: Across five QA benchmarks, SGR improved reasoning consistency and achieved a 17.74% performance gain over the base model. Fine-tuned LLaMA-3.3-70B achieved comparable performance to GPT-4o and outperformed Claude-3.5-Haiku.

Conclusion: Graph-structured reasoning enhances consistency and demonstrates the potential of enabling LLMs to construct and utilize their reasoning graphs in open-domain QA settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

*Hui Huang,Muyun Yang,Yuki Arase*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in factuality verification by introducing DiVA, a hybrid framework, and constructing FGVeriBench for fine-grained verification. Experiments show superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of binary judgments in existing factuality verification methods, limiting their utility in nuanced applications.

Method: The paper proposes DiVA, which combines generative models for agentic search and discriminative models for precise scoring. Additionally, FGVeriBench is established as a benchmark.

Result: DiVA outperformed existing methods in both general and multi-hop factuality verification tasks, as demonstrated on FGVeriBench.

Conclusion: DiVA and FGVeriBench advance the field by enabling fine-grained factuality verification, offering improved results and potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), their factuality remains a critical challenge, fueling growing interest in factuality verification. Existing research on factuality verification primarily conducts binary judgments (e.g., correct or incorrect), which fails to distinguish varying degrees of error severity. This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification. Experimental results on FGVeriBench demonstrate that our DiVA significantly outperforms existing methods on factuality verification for both general and multi-hop questions.

### [79] [Analyzing Reasoning Shifts in Audio Deepfake Detection under Adversarial Attacks: The Reasoning Tax versus Shield Bifurcation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03615)
*Binh Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of Audio Language Models (ALMs) in audio deepfake detection, focusing on reasoning shifts under adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transparency and explainability in audio deepfake detection, moving beyond black-box classifiers, and understand the vulnerabilities in predictive reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate ALMs' reasoning robustness under adversarial attacks, analyzing acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance.

Result: The study finds that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness, with reasoning acting either as a protective shield or a performance tax depending on model robustness. High cognitive dissonance may flag manipulation even if classification fails.

Conclusion: Reasoning in ALMs plays a nuanced role, with implications for forensic audio analysis and its weaknesses under adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents EPAG, a framework and dataset to evaluate the pre-consultation diagnostic capabilities of LLMs, revealing findings like small fine-tuned models outperforming larger ones in certain cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the evaluation of LLMs for pre-consultation uses in real-world clinical applications and improve the reliability of diagnostic tools.

Method: Introduced a benchmark dataset and framework (EPAG) and compared LLMs through direct HPI-guideline alignment and disease diagnosis via experiments.

Result: Small, fine-tuned LLMs performed better than larger models, while increasing HPI data wasn't always effective; pre-consultation language impacted dialogue quality.

Conclusion: EPAG contributes to better evaluation and advancement of LLMs in clinical scenarios by providing open-source tools and datasets for further research.

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

### [81] [Reasoning Model Is Superior LLM-Judge, Yet Suffers from Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03630)
*Hui Huang,Xuanxin Wu,Muyun Yang,Yuki Arase*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with non-reasoning LLMs, finding LRMs excel in judgment accuracy, instruction-following, and robustness, but exhibit biases, which are mitigated by a proposed evaluation strategy, PlanJudge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LRMs are superior to non-reasoning LLMs in judgment tasks and explore biases and robustness improvements.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical comparison and proposed PlanJudge, a strategy for generating explicit evaluation plans to reduce biases.

Result: LRMs outperformed non-reasoning LLMs in accuracy, instruction-following, and robustness but showed significant biases. PlanJudge improved robustness against biases for both LRMs and non-reasoning LLMs.

Conclusion: LRMs are more capable than non-reasoning LLMs in judgment tasks but are prone to biases, which can be effectively mitigated with the PlanJudge strategy.

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

*Zheng Wu,Xingyu Lou,Xinbei Ma,Yansi Li,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Jun Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Agent-Dice, a framework addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma in LLM-based agents by distinguishing common and conflicting knowledge for continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable LLM-based agents to learn new tasks continuously without catastrophic forgetting, a challenge rooted in the stability-plasticity dilemma.

Method: The method involves Agent-Dice, which utilizes geometric consensus filtering to remove conflicting gradients and curvature-based importance weighting to reinforce shared semantics.

Result: Agent-Dice achieves excellent performance in continual learning tasks with low computational costs, as demonstrated in GUI agents and tool-use agent domains.

Conclusion: Agent-Dice successfully addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma, offering a robust and efficient solution for continual learning in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents significantly extend the utility of LLMs by interacting with dynamic environments. However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this work, we argue that this dilemma fundamentally arises from the failure to explicitly distinguish between common knowledge shared across tasks and conflicting knowledge introduced by task-specific interference. To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework for modeling emotions as continuous probability distributions over an affective space, enabling structured sentiment analysis and insights into relational dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many previous text-based affect analysis approaches fail to account for emotion's inherent subjectivity, ambiguity, and relational coupling during human interactions.

Method: LLM-MC-Affect leverages language model stochastic decoding and Monte Carlo estimation to generate latent affective distributions and sentiment trajectories for structured analysis of interpersonal dynamics.

Result: The approach was validated using teacher-student dialogues, successfully identifying interaction insights such as effective scaffolding, demonstrating interpretive success.

Conclusion: This method provides scalable insights into interpersonal emotional dynamics, applicable across broader fields like social and behavioral studies.

Abstract: Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel ELO method is proposed to enhance continual pretraining for specific languages in MLLMs by optimizing select layers, achieving faster training and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome high costs and performance degradation in continual pretraining for multilingual language models.

Method: ELO method involves two stages: Pretraining detached critical layers and Layer Alignment involving reintegration and fine-tuning.

Result: Reduced computational cost (up to 6.46x faster training), improved target language performance (up to 6.2%), and preserved source language capabilities.

Conclusion: ELO is an efficient approach to enhance training speed and multilingual capabilities while maintaining performance in the source language.

Abstract: We propose an efficient layer-specific optimization (ELO) method designed to enhance continual pretraining (CP) for specific languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.

*Gengyang Li,Wang Cai,Yifeng Gao,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SyncThink is a training-free decoding method that reduces the overhead of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by monitoring reasoning-transition signals and terminating reasoning timely, achieving faster and efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and high inference costs of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where reasoning traces are often unnecessarily long and redundant.

Method: SyncThink leverages a reasoning-transition signal, identified in the model's attention to the special token '/think', to monitor and terminate the reasoning process at the right time without modifying model weights.

Result: SyncThink achieves an average Top-1 accuracy of 62.00% with reduced tokens (656 vs 2141) and latency (28.68 s vs 92.01 s) on datasets like GSM8K, MMLU, GPQA, and BBH. It demonstrates improved accuracy up to +8.1 on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: SyncThink effectively optimizes CoT reasoning by reducing redundant computations, improving efficiency, and maintaining or enhancing task accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often produces long and redundant traces that substantially increase inference cost. We present SyncThink, a training-free and plug-and-play decoding method that reduces CoT overhead without modifying model weights. We find that answer tokens attend weakly to early reasoning and instead focus on the special token "/think", indicating an information bottleneck. Building on this observation, SyncThink monitors the model's own reasoning-transition signal and terminates reasoning. Experiments on GSM8K, MMLU, GPQA, and BBH across three DeepSeek-R1 distilled models show that SyncThink achieves 62.00 percent average Top-1 accuracy using 656 generated tokens and 28.68 s latency, compared to 61.22 percent, 2141 tokens, and 92.01 s for full CoT decoding. On long-horizon tasks such as GPQA, SyncThink can further yield up to +8.1 absolute accuracy by preventing over-thinking.

*Haonan Chen,Sicheng Gao,Radu Timofte,Tetsuya Sakai,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in omni-modal embedding models by proposing e5-omni, a lightweight approach to enhance alignment, negative sampling, and cross-modal embedding consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern information systems need to handle diverse data modalities in a unified space for direct comparison. Current omni-modal embeddings have alignment issues inherited from pretrained backbones, leading to performance instability.

Method: The proposed e5-omni framework introduces modality-aware temperature calibration, negative curriculum control with debiasing, and batch whitening with covariance regularization to improve omni-modal embedding models.

Result: Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate that e5-omni outperforms strong baseline models in bi-modal and omni-modal tasks, showing reliable transferability across different VLM backbones.

Conclusion: e5-omni effectively addresses alignment, negative sampling, and embedding geometry issues, offering a robust solution for omni-modal embeddings. Pre-trained models are available for further replication and use.

Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces eTracer, a framework to verify system-generated biomedical responses by aligning claims with contextual evidence for improved faithfulness and traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient verification of system-generated responses, especially in critical fields like biomedical information, where accurate validation is crucial.

Method: eTracer performs post-hoc grounding by aligning response claims with contextual evidence and quantifies response faithfulness. It improves response verification by grounding responses to their contextual sources.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that eTracer enhances the grounding quality and user verification efficiency compared to traditional methods in aligning claims with evidence.

Conclusion: eTracer improves the trustworthiness and verifiability of generated responses, providing a practical method to trace and validate claims in text generation systems.

Abstract: How can system-generated responses be efficiently verified, especially in the high-stakes biomedical domain? To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency. The code and data are available at https://github.com/chubohao/eTracer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA benchmarks do not adequately address the challenges of reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, which is crucial in disaster management.

Method: The researchers constructed the DisastQA benchmark with 3,000 questions through a human-LLM collaboration pipeline, ensuring balanced disaster type coverage. They introduced a keypoint-based evaluation protocol for open-ended QA emphasizing factual completeness.

Result: Experiments with 20 models revealed that while some models performed well in clean evidence settings, their performance deteriorated significantly in realistic noise scenarios, highlighting reliability gaps.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved QA model reliability under noisy conditions for effective disaster response. All resources for DisastQA are publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate question answering (QA) in disaster management requires reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, a setting poorly captured by existing benchmarks built on clean evidence. We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response.

*Weiqi Liu,Yongliang Miao,Haiyan Zhao,Yanguang Liu,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuronScope addresses challenges in interpreting polysemantic neurons in LLMs by using an iterative process to deconstruct and refine semantic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysemanticity in neurons of LLMs makes interpretation difficult, as existing single-pass methods fail to effectively capture multiple semantic concepts.

Method: NeuronScope employs a multi-agent, iterative framework to deconstruct activations into semantic components, cluster them into distinct modes, and refine explanations based on activation feedback.

Result: NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity in neurons and provides explanations with higher activation correlation compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: NeuronScope offers a significant advancement in understanding neuron-level behavior in LLMs by effectively handling polysemanticity challenges and improving interpretability.

Abstract: Neuron-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally challenged by widespread polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple distinct semantic concepts. Existing single-pass interpretation methods struggle to faithfully capture such multi-concept behavior. In this work, we propose NeuronScope, a multi-agent framework that reformulates neuron interpretation as an iterative, activation-guided process. NeuronScope explicitly deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them into distinct semantic modes, and iteratively refines each explanation using neuron activation feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity and produces explanations with significantly higher activation correlation compared to single-pass baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses compositional generalization issues in LLMs and agent systems by proposing STEPS, a framework for generating compositionally challenging data to enhance performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of instruction-following and agent-centric tasks caused by a lack of compositional skill diversity, which results in poor generalization.

Method: The authors introduce STEPS, which creates a hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. It synthesizes data based on constrained information maximization within the taxonomy while maintaining semantic coherence.

Result: STEPS outperformed existing data synthesis methods in instruction-following benchmarks and enhanced generalization in agent-based tasks.

Conclusion: STEPS is an effective framework for improving compositional generalization, addressing a critical gap in LLM and agent system capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

### [91] [From Implicit to Explicit: Token-Efficient Logical Supervision for Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03682)
*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional methods like Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) fail at significantly improving logical reasoning errors in large language models (LLMs). The proposed First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR) framework addresses this by focusing on understanding logical relationships in initial problem steps, achieving improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the observed limitation of large language models in logical reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving, by proposing an alternative training method for better logical relationship understanding.

Method: The study introduces First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a framework which separately trains models on the initial planning step of a problem—deciding the relevant variables and operations—rather than embedding logical relationships within full solution pathways.

Result: FSLR outperforms CoT-SFT across various models and datasets, showing an average improvement of 3.2% in in-distribution settings and 4.6% in out-of-distribution settings. It also achieves 4-6x faster training and consumes 80% fewer training tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed FSLR provides a more efficient and effective solution to improving logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, ensuring better performance while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

*Pharath Sathya,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation framework for AI story generation to better capture the subjective nature of creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics fail to address the subjective and multifaceted nature of creativity in AI-generated stories.

Method: The authors propose a structured evaluation framework with four main components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, Resonance) and eleven sub-components, complemented by controlled experiments (via Spike Prompting) and a crowdsourced study.

Result: The study reveals creativity evaluations are hierarchical, change at different judgment stages, and reflective evaluations alter outcomes and agreement levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in uncovering dimensions of creativity overlooked by traditional evaluation methods.

Abstract: Evaluating creative text generation remains a challenge because existing reference-based metrics fail to capture the subjective nature of creativity. We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red teaming datasets lack consistent risk categorizations, domain coverage, and modern evaluations, making it hard to systematically assess LLM vulnerabilities.

Method: Developing RedBench, aggregating 37 datasets into a unified framework with 22 risk categories and 19 domains, accompanied by an open-source platform for evaluation.

Result: Detailed analysis of existing datasets, baselines for LLMs on RedBench, and open-source dataset/tools for systematic vulnerability assessments.

*Sangmin Yoo,Srikanth Malla,Chiho Choi,Wei D. Lu,Joon Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADEPT introduces a dynamic early-exit mechanism for transformers, optimizing computation with up to 25% efficiency gains, 4x speed-up for classification, and enhanced performance by up to 45%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce computational workloads for large language models without sacrificing performance and efficiently addressing limitations in traditional early-exit strategies.

Method: ADEPT employs adaptive token-level dynamic early-exit mechanisms, optimizing efficiency by adjusting computation based on token complexity. It also refines the KV cache procedure to enable practical token-level early exit.

Result: ADEPT achieves significant efficiency improvements: up to 25% in language generation tasks, 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, and up to 45% performance enhancement.

Conclusion: ADEPT successfully addresses constraints of traditional early exit methods, offering enhanced efficiency and performance improvements for language tasks.

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

### [96] [Visual Merit or Linguistic Crutch? A Close Look at DeepSeek-OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03714)
*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Bo Li,Hong Li,Kai Yan,Qingwen Li,Min Yang,Okamoto Satoshi,Zhe Cui,Shiwen Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR employs 2D optical mapping to compress vision-text, decoding over ten times the input visual tokens. It struggles without linguistic support and collapses with extensive text contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate whether DeepSeek-OCR's performance is driven by visual abilities or linguistic priors.

Method: The study uses semantic corruption experiments at both sentence and word levels, comparing results with 13 baseline models and conducting context stress tests.

Result: Without language priors, DeepSeek-OCR's accuracy drops from 90% to 20%. Comparative analysis shows traditional OCR methods are more robust under semantic perturbation. End-to-end methods exhibit limitations in extended contexts.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR’s reliance on linguistic priors and its constraints in long-context handling highlight the need for optimizing vision-text compression techniques.

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: "Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm. We release all data, results and scripts used in this study at https://github.com/dududuck00/DeepSeekOCR.

*Jin Cui,Jiaqi Guo,Jiepeng Zhou,Ruixuan Yang,Jiayi Lu,Jiajun Xu,Jiangcheng Song,Boran Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIND, a framework to improve knowledge transfer from large language models (LLMs) to smaller models by aligning the distillation process with the student's adaptation capabilities while addressing resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring reasoning capabilities from large language models to smaller ones is difficult due to challenges in achieving both domain-specific performance and cross-domain generalization simultaneously.

Method: The proposed framework, MIND, employs a "Teaching Assistant" network and a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism to dynamically adjust supervision to the student's capacity, synthesizing diverse teacher perspectives and aligning learning with the model's current adaptability.

Result: MIND outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, while avoiding issues like catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that aligning distillation processes dynamically with the student's abilities can significantly enhance reasoning skills in smaller models and maintain robust generalization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable capabilities in complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, practical resource constraints have sparked interest in transferring these abilities to smaller models. However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's "optimal" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel "Teaching Assistant" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and our sophisticated latent space analysis further confirms the mechanism of reasoning ability internalization.

### [98] [Stuttering-Aware Automatic Speech Recognition for Indonesian Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03727)
*Fadhil Muhammad,Alwin Djuliansah,Adrian Aryaputra Hamzah,Kurniawati Azizah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered speech data for low-resource languages like Indonesian to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance on stuttered speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems perform poorly on stuttered speech, especially in low-resource languages like Indonesian, where stuttering-specific datasets are unavailable.

Method: The authors use a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models to create synthetic stuttered text, which is then converted to audio via text-to-speech synthesis. They fine-tune an Indonesian pre-trained Whisper model using transfer learning.

Result: The results show that synthetic data enhances the model's ability to recognize stuttered speech while retaining its performance on fluent speech.

Conclusion: Synthetic data pipelines are effective for improving ASR systems for stuttered speech in under-represented languages, ensuring more inclusive speech technology.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have achieved remarkable performance on fluent speech but continue to degrade significantly when processing stuttered speech, a limitation that is particularly acute for low-resource languages like Indonesian where specialized datasets are virtually non-existent. To overcome this scarcity, we propose a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting repetitions and prolongations into fluent text through a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models followed by text-to-speech synthesis. We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted synthetic exposure consistently reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while maintaining performance on fluent segments, validating the utility of synthetic data pipelines for developing more inclusive speech technologies in under-represented languages.

Abstract: The performance gap between closed-source and open-source large language models (LLMs) is largely attributed to disparities in access to high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data. Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end.

*Jakob Schuster,Vagrant Gautam,Katja Markert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models handle knowledge conflicts influenced by their source preferences, proposing methods to understand and mitigate repetition biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to study LLM behavior under knowledge conflicts and how credibility of information sources impacts their responses, especially as these models are integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Method: A novel framework evaluates 13 open-weight LLMs under tightly-controlled conditions, analyzing source preferences and addressing bias caused by repeated information.

Result: LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated sources but are susceptible to bias from repeated information from less credible sources. A proposed method reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8% while preserving source preferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights the influence of credibility on knowledge resolution in LLMs and provides solutions to minimize repetition bias, encouraging future research on this topic.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.

*Dominik Macko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the multilingual and personalized text generation capabilities of large language models, exploring potential misuse and benefits across 10 languages and 16 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how personalization in multilingual text generation affects both its quality and detectability, addressing concerns about misuse and potential benefits.

Method: The researchers analyzed 17,280 generated texts, combining personalization aspects across demographic groups and social-media platforms in 10 languages, using 16 language models.

Result: The analysis revealed variations in personalization quality across languages, with English showing high personalization quality. Personalization towards social-media platforms was found to reduce detectability more than demographic targeting.

Conclusion: Personalization in multilingual text generation presents both risks and opportunities, with quality and detectability heavily influenced by language and personalization target.

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

*Pingjun Hong,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates if self-explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) help users predict model behavior, using counterfactual queries in StrategyQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research indicates that LLM-produced rationales may not truly represent the decision process, raising questions about their utility in predicting model behavior.

Method: They assess counterfactual simulatability by having humans and LLM judges predict model's answers to follow-up questions with or without access to self-explanations. Comparisons between alternative perturbation strategies are used.

Result: Self-explanations improve prediction accuracy for both humans and LLM judges, though effectiveness varies with the perturbation strategies and the evaluator's capability.

Conclusion: Access to explanations aids humans in forming more accurate predictions for perturbed questions and reinforces their understanding of the model's behavior within those contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores intrinsic dimension (ID) in large language models (LLMs) to analyze linguistic complexity, finding that ID varies based on formal and functional aspects of sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the intrinsic dimension (ID) in LLMs can act as a marker for different types of linguistic complexity.

Method: Experiments to analyze ID variations in different layers of LLMs for specific linguistic structures, using methods like representational similarity and layer ablation.

Result: ID profiles showed variations in representing both formal complexity (e.g., clause structures) and functional complexity (e.g., sentence embedding styles and ambiguity), aligning with linguistic processing phases.

Conclusion: The intrinsic dimension is a valuable tool for distinguishing linguistic complexity types and correlates to stages of linguistic processing in LLMs across models.

Abstract: We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy risks associated with Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) and introduces the HearSay benchmark for analyzing privacy leakage in these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the privacy implications of ALLMs, which had been largely overlooked despite their advancements in audio understanding and generation.

Method: The authors developed the HearSay benchmark with over 22,000 real-world audio clips, ensuring data quality via automated profiling and human verification, and conducted extensive evaluations on privacy leakage.

Result: Experiments reveal significant privacy leakage by ALLMs, insufficient safety mechanisms against privacy intrusion, and increased risks through advanced reasoning methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Conclusion: ALLMs pose serious privacy threats that require urgent measures for privacy alignment. HearSay serves as a valuable tool for highlighting and addressing these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: While Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generation, their potential privacy implications remain largely unexplored. This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment.

*Dehao Tao,Guoliang Ma,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Membox, a hierarchical memory system that improves topic continuity and coherence in human-agent dialogues by grouping and linking dialogue turns based on thematic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory systems for large language models fail to preserve topic continuity in dialogues, resulting in fragmented and biased representations.

Method: The proposed Membox architecture uses a Topic Loom to group same-topic dialogue exchanges into coherent "memory boxes" and a Trace Weaver to link these boxes across temporal gaps, forming narrative event timelines.

Result: Membox demonstrates a 68% improvement in F1 scores for temporal reasoning tasks compared to baselines, achieving better performance with lower computational resource usage.

Conclusion: Membox offers an efficient and cognitively inspired solution for enhancing both coherence and topic continuity in language model-based agents.

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a retraining-free selection relevance score for identifying influential training examples that improve explanation quality of a model’s predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of example-based explanations by better selecting subsets of influential training data, addressing the lack of prior focus on selection strategies.

Method: Introduced a novel metric, the selection relevance score, validated through fine-tuning experiments, and compared selection strategies to improve training data contribution estimation.

Result: Validation experiments demonstrated the proposed score’s effectiveness in predicting example support or undermining for model predictions, revealing that common selection methods perform worse than random selection.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively balances influence and representativeness, optimizing the selection process for example-based explanations.

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underexplored field of translating sentences containing neologisms (newly coined terms) compared to general machine translation.

Method: They create a dataset covering 16 languages and 75 directions, develop a Wiktionary-based search tool, and design a reinforcement learning framework with specific reward and rollout mechanisms to train translation agents.

Result: The proposed approach leverages RL and the custom search tool to improve neologism-aware machine translation accuracy.

Conclusion: NeoAMT framework successfully enhances neologism translation, filling a gap in MT research, with practical contributions like datasets and tools.

Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.

### [108] [Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791)
*Xiaoyu Luo,Yiyi Chen,Qiongxiu Li,Johannes Bjerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a new framework to evaluate LLMs for PII leakage, isolating genuine memorization from cue-driven results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Papers aim to address the misconception of PII leakage in LLMs due to memorization, by separating genuine memorization from cue-induced responses.

Method: The authors propose Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM), a framework that eliminates lexical cues during PII leakage evaluations, and conduct empirical analysis across languages and paradigms.

Result: Analysis revealed that much of the perceived PII leakage is attributable to lexical cues, not actual memorization. When cues are neutralized, memorization detection drops significantly.

Conclusion: True PII leakage via memorization in LLMs is rare and often misinterpreted. The study emphasizes cue-controlled evaluations for accurate privacy assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

*Huynh Trung Kiet,Dao Sy Duy Minh,Nguyen Dinh Ha Duong,Le Hoang Minh Huy,Long Nguyen,Dien Dinh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset for Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), addressing the lack of structured benchmarks in this culturally specific domain. It introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for dataset creation and evaluates model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured, high-quality benchmarks for Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM) and improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in culturally specific and specialized medical domains.

Method: The authors introduced VietMed-MCQ, a dataset created using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and a dual-model validation mechanism to ensure consistency. The dataset's accuracy was validated by medical experts and students, and it includes 3,190 questions across three levels of difficulty.

Result: Evaluation of seven open-source models showed that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperformed Vietnamese-centric ones, showcasing cross-lingual transfer. However, all models had difficulty with complex diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of VietMed-MCQ in advancing research in VTM and low-resource medical domains. The dataset and code are shared publicly to encourage further scientific exploration and model improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.

### [110] [Where meaning lives: Layer-wise accessibility of psycholinguistic features in encoder and decoder language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03798)
*Taisiia Tikhomirova,Dirk U. Wulff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies where transformer models encode psycholinguistic meaning by examining 58 features across 10 models. Results show methodological dependency in findings, with representations from earlier layers often being more informative than final layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where transformer language models encode meaning and how methodological choices impact it for both theoretical insights and practical applications.

Method: A layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models (encoder and decoder types), comparing three methods of embedding extraction.

Result: Embedding methods impact localization inference, with contextualized embeddings being more selective and models sharing a layer interaction pattern—lexical features peak earlier; affective dimensions peak later.

Conclusion: Where meaning is encoded in transformers depends on both methodological choices and model architecture, requiring careful interpretation of probing results.

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AI text detection methods to combat academic integrity violations caused by LLM-generated student work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing use of LLM-generated text by students has raised concerns regarding academic integrity, necessitating effective detection tools.

Method: Evaluation of traditional machine learning and transformer-based approaches on HC3 and DAIGT v2 datasets, using topic-based data split to ensure generalization.

Result: TF-IDF logistic regression achieves baseline accuracy of 82.87%, but deep learning models like BiLSTM (88.86%) and DistilBERT (88.11%) outperform it. DistilBERT provides the best ROC-AUC of 0.96.

Conclusion: Contextual semantic modeling is superior to lexical features, and topic-based splits reduce memorization effects. Dataset diversity and computational improvements can enhance future methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

*Fei Wu,Zhenrong Zhang,Qikai Chang,Jianshu Zhang,Quan Liu,Jun Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inefficiencies in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models by introducing a new fine-grained method for credit assignment, which improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of LLMs providing redundant verification or overturning correct answers due to coarse-grained reward estimation methods in RLVR.

Method: Introducing a training-free probing mechanism to measure step-wise reasoning progress using a Step Potential signal, combined with a new method, Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), for better credit assignment.

Result: SPAE improves reasoning accuracy, reduces response length, and outperforms current state-of-the-art RL methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPAE offers a more precise and efficient approach to reasoning in LLMs, addressing flaws in existing RLVR methods and providing meaningful improvements for practical applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods.

### [113] [Rethinking Table Pruning in TableQA: From Sequential Revisions to Gold Trajectory-Supervised Parallel Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03851)
*Yu Guo,Shenghao Ye,Shuangwu Chen,Zijian Wen,Tao Zhang,Qirui Bai,Dong Jin,Yunpeng Hou,Huasen He,Jian Yang,Xiaobin Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TabTrim is a novel table pruning framework enhancing TableQA by transforming pruning from sequential revisions to parallel search supervised by gold trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods in TableQA often fail to appropriately remove redundant cells without losing answer-critical data, and rely heavily on unreliable sequential critique signals.

Method: TabTrim generates a gold pruning trajectory and employs a pruner and verifier to ensure pruning steps align with it. It conducts parallel search for identifying the optimal sub-table.

Result: TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance in tabular reasoning tasks, with 73.5% average accuracy and improvements across datasets like WikiTQ and TableBench.

Conclusion: TabTrim offers significant advancements in table pruning for TableQA, effectively improving accuracy and performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

### [114] [What Does Loss Optimization Actually Teach, If Anything? Knowledge Dynamics in Continual Pre-training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03858)
*Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Simone Alghisi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) in LLMs, highlighting that optimization (loss reduction) does not align with actual factual knowledge learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate knowledge acquisition dynamics in CPT and address the gap between loss optimization and factual knowledge learning, which is crucial for improving LLMs.

Method: The authors construct a distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and integrate diagnostic probes into the CPT loop for epoch-level analysis of learning dynamics and OOD competence.

Result: Findings reveal that optimization (loss reduction) and learning diverge: factual learning is unstable, facts are rarely consolidated, OOD skills degrade, and rapid reconfiguration in knowledge circuits occurs during CPT.

Conclusion: Loss optimization alone cannot reliably track learning progress in CPT. Alternative stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics should be developed.

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'PartisanLens,' a multilingual dataset of hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, aimed at analyzing political discourses and detecting narratives like PRCT. They evaluate large language models on this dataset and explore their annotation abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in identifying complex, dangerous political narratives (like PRCT) that drive polarisation, violence, and misinformation, using current resources that are English-centric and fragmented.

Method: The authors created a multilingual dataset, evaluated the performance of large language models on it, and analyzed their ability to act as automatic annotators. They also conditioned models on socio-economic and ideological profiles to emulate human-like annotation.

Result: The study found LLMs capable but with limitations. They showcase potential for future annotation tasks but highlight the need for improvement. The 'PartisanLens' dataset establishes baselines for studying hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives.

Conclusion: 'PartisanLens' offers a resource for analyzing political discourse in European contexts, emphasizing the importance and limitations of LLMs in detecting hyperpartisan/conspiratorial narratives.

Abstract: Detecting hyperpartisan narratives and Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT) is essential to addressing the spread of misinformation. These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs, analyzing 32 models using extensive attacks, revealing vulnerabilities and strategies for improving security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand and enhance the safety and reliability of large language and retrieval models by investigating factors influencing safety alignment.

Method: The study evaluates 32 models across 13 families with sizes ranging from 3B to 235B parameters, utilizing five safety datasets, 56 jailbreak techniques, and four CoT attack strategies.

Result: Key findings: (1) Integrated reasoning/self-reflection ensures better safety alignment; (2) Post-training and knowledge distillation can degrade safety alignment; (3) CoT attacks with response prefixes expose vulnerabilities; (4) Roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based searching are common adversarial methods.

Conclusion: Safety alignment must be a prioritized objective during training stages, and architectural safeguards are needed to mitigate vulnerabilities exposed by adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents are promising for practical AI assistance, but their development is limited by the unavailability of sufficient training environments.

Method: InfiniteWeb utilizes a unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seeds with reference design images to create diverse and functional websites, enabling reinforcement learning with detailed task evaluators.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that InfiniteWeb outperforms commercial coding solutions and significantly enhances GUI agent training, achieving improved results on benchmark tasks like OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web.

Conclusion: InfiniteWeb successfully generates scalable and realistic web environments, substantially advancing GUI agent development and reinforcing its effectiveness through experimental validation.

Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATLAS, a dynamic dual-path framework for selecting optimal language model-tool combinations, achieving superior performance metrics and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize model-tool combinations across increasing diversity of language models and tools for AI agents in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: ATLAS employs a dual-path approach: training-free cluster-based routing for in-domain alignment and RL-based multi-step routing for generalization beyond known distributions.

Result: ATLAS demonstrated improved performance on cross-domain benchmarks, exceeding GPT-4o by +10.1% on in-domain and +13.1% out-of-domain tasks, with notable improvements in visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Dynamic tool usage via ATLAS effectively enhances reasoning across diverse domains, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI agents. However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks. Furthermore, our framework shows significant gains in visual reasoning by orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools.

TL;DR: Small, decoder-only language models (SLMs) were tested for grammar correction and text simplification tasks, but they performed below robust large language models (LLMs), struggling with meaning retention and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether small, decoder-only language models can offer an efficient alternative for tasks like grammar correction and text simplification.

Method: Small language models were tested in various modes (out-of-the-box, fine-tuned, run sequentially) on JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics.

Result: SLMs demonstrated learning of certain behaviors but performed below strong baselines and LLMs, with struggles in meaning retention and hallucinations.

Conclusion: While efficient, current SLMs are not competitive with modern LLMs for rewriting tasks, requiring further advancements in training.

Abstract: Large language models have become extremely popular recently due to their ability to achieve strong performance on a variety of tasks, such as text generation and rewriting, but their size and computation cost make them difficult to access, deploy, and secure in many settings. This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a framework to enhance Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by dynamically assessing the need for retrieval and refining evidence selection, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods often conduct retrieval indiscriminately and depend on single-path evidence construction, leading to noise and suboptimal performance.

Method: DTR utilizes generation uncertainty to decide when retrieval is needed and employs a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive selection to handle complex queries.

Result: DTR boosts EM and F1 scores across five benchmarks and reduces unnecessary retrievals compared to standard RAG and strong baselines.

Conclusion: DTR effectively enhances RAG frameworks by reducing noise, improving performance, and optimizing retrieval processes in open-domain QA tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, but existing approaches indiscriminately trigger retrieval and rely on single-path evidence construction, often introducing noise and limiting performance gains. In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

*Hugh Mee Wong,Rick Nouwen,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how language models internally process multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) tasks, focusing on reasoning errors versus symbol-binding failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models differentiate between reasoning errors and failures in emitting the correct symbol in MCQA tasks, leveraging insights into their internal mechanisms.

Method: Analyzing language model representations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), linear probes, and causal interventions, alongside tests under permutations to reveal underlying mechanisms.

Result: Language models demonstrate a two-stage progression in MCQA: selecting the correct 'winner' in content space and binding it to the corresponding symbol. Signals in residual states indicate per-option correctness and final winner identification.

Conclusion: MCQA involves a two-stage mechanism in language models, separating content selection from symbol binding. This provides insights into the internal reasoning processes and decoding challenges in models.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is easy to evaluate but adds a meta-task: models must both solve the problem and output the symbol that *represents* the answer, conflating reasoning errors with symbol-binding failures. We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Doc-PP benchmark to evaluate and address safety concerns in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for document question answering under strict non-disclosure policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of adhering to user-defined, dynamic disclosure policies in multimodal settings, which are overlooked by current safety-focused research based on implicit norms and text-only scenarios.

Method: The method involves creating the Doc-PP benchmark and proposing DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework to separate reasoning from policy verification.

Result: Experimental results show that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, mitigating information leakage issues and ensuring policy compliance for document understanding.

Conclusion: The study highlights reasoning-induced safety gaps in LVLMs and presents DVA as an effective solution for policy-compliant reasoning in multimodal document settings.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for real-world document question answering is often constrained by dynamic, user-defined policies that dictate information disclosure based on context. While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding

*Paweł Liskowski,Krzysztof Jankowski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Arctic-ABSA is a new set of models for aspect-based sentiment analysis that improves over existing baselines in multiple ways including accuracy and multilingual support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges with current ABSA models, such as their limited sentiment classification categories, lack of multilingual support, and ineffective reasoning mechanisms.

Method: They train their models on a large dataset (20x larger than SemEval14) combining public and synthetic data. They expand sentiment classes from 3 to 5, support multiple languages, and use reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought fine-tuning and novel reasoning pretraining.

Result: The models outperform baselines like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by up to 10% on accuracy and achieve state-of-the-art results on SemEval14. A multilingual model maintains high accuracy (87-91%) across six languages.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates significant advancements in ABSA through data augmentation, expanded sentiment classification, reasoning improvements, and multilingual support. The release of a large-scale benchmark facilitates further research.

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RADAR, a system for fake news detection, combines retrieval-augmented verification and adversarial feedback to achieve superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of combating misinformation spread by leveraging large language models.

Method: RADAR integrates a generator rewriting real articles with factual errors, a passage retrieval-based detector, and introduces verbal adversarial feedback (VAF) for co-evolution.

Result: RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC on a fake news detection benchmark, outperforming general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: Detector-side retrieval and structured adversarial feedback are crucial for robust and effective fake news detection.

Abstract: To efficiently combat the spread of LLM-generated misinformation, we present RADAR, a retrieval-augmented detector with adversarial refinement for robust fake news detection. Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Benchmark^2, a systematic framework with three metrics to assess the quality of benchmarks for large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in benchmarks for LLM evaluation requires systematic methods to evaluate benchmark quality, ensuring robust and effective model comparison.

Method: Benchmark^2 uses three metrics: Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, Discriminability Score, and Capability Alignment Deviation, applied to 15 benchmarks with 11 LLMs across four model families.

Result: The experiments revealed quality disparities among benchmarks and showed that selective benchmark construction using the metrics achieves optimal evaluation performance with fewer test sets.

Conclusion: Utilizing Benchmark^2 can optimize benchmark quality, enhancing LLM evaluations and reducing the size of test sets while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

*José Pedro Evans,Luís Filipe Cunha,Purificação Silvano,Alípio Jorge,Nuno Guimarães,Sérgio Nunes,Ricardo Campos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces VotIE, a task for extracting structured voting information from municipal meeting minutes, establishes a benchmark using Portuguese data, and evaluates various model performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of extracting structured voting data from highly variable and freeform municipal meeting records, which is important for understanding local democratic processes.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate VotIE, leveraging fine-tuned encoders like XLM-R-CRF and few-shot LLMs to extract voting events from narrative deliberative records, using Portuguese municipal meeting minutes as the benchmark dataset.

Result: XLM-R-CRF achieved the strongest performance with 93.2% macro F1 in in-domain evaluations, but faced performance drops in cross-municipality settings. Few-shot LLMs were more robust in generalization but at a higher computational cost.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned encoders are currently more practical for real-world deployment due to their lower computational requirements, despite few-shot LLMs offering better generalization. The benchmark and resources are publicly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes record key decisions in local democratic processes. Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.

*Alexander Scarlatos,Jaewook Lee,Simon Woodhead,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses student simulation in LLM-powered tutoring, establishes evaluation metrics, and benchmarks methods, revealing subpar performance of prompting-based simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate new LLM-based educational technologies effectively and at scale without requiring real students, thus saving time and resources.

Method: The study defines the student simulation task, develops evaluation metrics covering linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive factors, and benchmarks student simulation methods using a math tutoring dialogue dataset.

Result: Prompting-based student simulation strategies perform poorly, while supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization offer better but still limited results.

Conclusion: Current methods for simulating students are insufficient, and significant advancements are needed to enhance the quality and usability of these simulations for educational purposes.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.

*Jonggeun Lee,Junseong Pyo,Gyuhyeon Seo,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) in judging speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues, revealing significant challenges and biases in these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of LALMs in assessing speaker consistency across multi-turn dialogues, a key metric yet untapped in the evaluation of speech quality.

Method: The study developed SpeakerSleuth and constructed 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across synthetic and real datasets and tested nine LALMs on tasks addressing speaker consistency.

Result: LALMs exhibited limitations in detecting acoustic inconsistencies, performed poorly in identifying problematic turns, and prioritized text over acoustics. However, they succeeded in acoustic discrimination tasks aligning speech samples with speakers.

Conclusion: LALMs have inherent biases toward textual coherence over acoustic signals, indicating modality imbalances. These require addressing to enhance their reliability in evaluating speaker consistency.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) as judges have emerged as a prominent approach for evaluating speech generation quality, yet their ability to assess speaker consistency across multi-turn conversations remains unexplored. We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving multilingual machine translation, especially for low-resource languages, by studying cross-lingual knowledge transfer and optimizing learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating effective cross-lingual representations, especially for low-resource languages in machine translation.

Method: The study analyzes the impact of linguistic similarities, retrieval methods, auxiliary supervision, training strategies, and language diversity to enhance cross-lingual transfer and robustness.

Result: The research demonstrates that increased translation coverage improves generalization, reduces off-target behavior, and provides a framework for inclusive multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights into how modeling and data decisions shape multilingual learning, aiding the development of resilient multilingual systems.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation systems aim to make knowledge accessible across languages, yet learning effective cross-lingual representations remains challenging. These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SaLAD, a benchmark to evaluate the safety of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities in their ability to generate safe responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the safety risks posed by MLLMs as their irresponsible outputs can negatively influence human behavior and daily life, requiring comprehensive safety evaluations.

Method: The authors developed SaLAD, a benchmark with 2,013 image-text samples across 10 categories, focusing on real-world risks and employing a safety-warning-based evaluation framework rather than simplistic rejections.

Result: Top-performing MLLMs only achieved a 57.2% safe response rate, indicating substantial deficiencies in existing safety alignment methods for identifying risky behaviors.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with producing sufficiently safe responses in multimodal interactions, and robust alignment methods are urgently needed to mitigate their vulnerabilities.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

### [131] [Modular Prompt Optimization: Optimizing Structured Prompts with Section-Local Textual Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04055)
*Prith Sharma,Austin Z. Henley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO) is a framework to enhance prompts for language models using structured sections and section-local refinement rather than treating prompts as blocks of text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current prompt optimization methods, which treat prompts as monolithic blocks, making it difficult to localize errors and preserve important instructions.

Method: MPO structures prompts into semantic sections (e.g., system role, context) and applies section-local textual gradients for independent optimization while maintaining the overall structure. Updates are consolidated to reduce redundancy.

Result: MPO outperformed untuned structured prompts and baseline methods on reasoning benchmarks ARC-Challenge and MMLU using small models, improving accuracy without changing model parameters or prompt structure.

Conclusion: Maintaining a fixed prompt schema and optimizing sections independently is a practical and effective strategy for enhancing smaller language models' reasoning performance.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.

*Yuanfeng Xu,Yuhao Chen,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current generative models for multimodal tasks by proposing CoM-DAD. The framework combines continuous latent diffusion for semantics and discrete absorbing diffusion for token generation to achieve unified text-image generation with improved stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the bifurcation in generative modeling between text (discrete data) and images (continuous data), and to resolve the challenges in multimodal masked generation and alignment between different modalities.

Method: The proposed method, CoM-DAD, uses a hierarchical dual-process: continuous latent diffusion for semantic planning and discrete absorbing diffusion for token synthesis. It introduces a Variable-Rate Noise Schedule and Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport strategy for better modality alignment.

Result: The new approach demonstrates superior stability compared to standard masked modeling methods, enabling scalable and unified text-image generation.

Conclusion: CoM-DAD successfully establishes a novel paradigm for multimodal generative modeling, integrating scalability and improved alignment across text and image modalities.

Abstract: The bifurcation of generative modeling into autoregressive approaches for discrete data (text) and diffusion approaches for continuous data (images) hinders the development of truly unified multimodal systems. While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to reduce hallucinations in large language models by using a knowledge distillation method with a programmable code-guided module, improving reasoning accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address hallucinations caused by prompt-induced errors in large language models, enhancing their reliability and contextual understanding.

Method: This method incorporates a programmable module for knowledge graph exploration within the reasoning prompt, enabling better external knowledge integration and error regulation during inference.

Result: The proposed approach shows significant improvement in reasoning performance, with HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increasing by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, using models like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations, delivering more accurate and interpretable reasoning outputs in large language models.

Abstract: To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

TL;DR: SearchAttack reveals how web search can be exploited to bypass safeguards in search-augmented LLMs, posing significant risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unreliability gap and harm risk from search-augmented LLMs emerge when harmful content bypasses LLM safeguards through web search.

Method: Proposed "SearchAttack", which generates fragmentary search queries to retrieve harmful content, and guides LLMs to reformat them via structural rubrics.

Result: SearchAttack proves highly effective in attacking search-augmented LLM systems through extensive experiments aimed at assessing vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Search-augmented LLMs present a critical attack vector via harmful web search content; SearchAttack is an effective tool for exposing these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.

*Maryam Rahimi,Mahdi Nouri,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how positional biases evolve across layers in short-context language models, using an attribution-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the evolution of positional biases across model layers, their stability across inputs, and their independence from task complexity.

Method: The authors employed layer conductance with a sliding-window approach to derive layer-wise positional importance profiles in short-context language models.

Result: It was found that positional importance profiles are architecture-specific, input-stable, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Recency bias increases with depth, primacy bias diminishes, and early layers focus on content words while later layers lose differentiation.

Conclusion: Positional effects in language models are systematic and layer-dependent, with implications for understanding model architecture and improving model performance.

Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextFocus, a method to enhance context faithfulness in LLMs without requiring model finetuning, while improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges LLMs face when their internal knowledge conflicts with externally retrieved context, often leading to unfaithful outputs.

Method: The proposed ContextFocus relies on lightweight activation steering during inference, avoiding the need for finetuning and retaining efficiency.

Result: ContextFocus demonstrates significant improvement in contextual-faithfulness compared to strong baselines on the ConFiQA benchmark, while being complementary to prompting strategies.

Conclusion: ContextFocus offers an effective, robust, and efficient solution for improving contextual-faithfulness in LLM outputs, especially in knowledge-conflict situations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLEx, a method to reduce errors in language models using a few explanatory examples, showing improved performance compared to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the persistent errors in language models that can be repeated across similar queries, particularly in challenging domains where scalable expert annotations are difficult.

Method: FLEx selects representative errors via embedding-based clustering, confirms the effectiveness of explanations to correct errors, and creates a prompt summary that guides the model during inference without altering its weights.

Result: FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on datasets like CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF, cutting down up to 83% of CoT's errors.

Conclusion: FLEx demonstrates a practical and effective way to improve language model behavior using limited explanatory examples, showing strong error reduction and transferability across datasets.

Abstract: Language models have become effective at a wide range of tasks, from math problem solving to open-domain question answering. However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\% of CoT's remaining errors.

TL;DR: RFC Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on detecting financial misinformation in news, particularly emphasizing the complexities of contextual belief states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges faced by large language models in handling financial misinformation within realistic and complex financial news contexts.

Method: The authors present RFC Bench with two tasks: (1) reference-free misinformation detection and (2) comparison-based diagnosis using paired original and perturbed data inputs.

Result: Findings show that models perform better in comparative contexts than in reference-free scenarios, where issues like prediction instability and invalid outputs emerge.

Conclusion: RFC Bench highlights the gaps in current models’ abilities and serves as a testbed to enhance reasoning and improve misinformation detection related to financial news in real-world contexts.

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.

### [142] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in effectively erasing harmful concepts from diffusion models by introducing a hierarchical approach to organize and suppress related concepts collectively, ensuring preserved generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies and generation quality degradation in current concept erasure methods as the number of erased concepts increases.

Method: Introduces a concept hierarchy using parent-child (supertype-subtype) relationships and a group-wise suppression mechanism. Proposes SuPLoRA (Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation) to selectively update parameters during erasure, preserving generative performance.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved efficiency and effectiveness in erasing harmful concepts while maintaining generative capabilities across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The hierarchical and parameter-efficient approach shows promise in addressing real-world challenges by ensuring scalability and quality in concept erasure from diffusion models.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

### [143] [Better, But Not Sufficient: Testing Video ANNs Against Macaque IT Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03392)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates macaque IT cortex responses during video viewing and compares them against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Current video models lack ability to capture the appearance-invariant computations expressed in IT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the primate ventral visual stream processes dynamic visual information and comparing these mechanisms with artificial neural networks.

Method: The study compared neural responses in macaque IT during naturalistic videos with outputs from static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. It also used stress tests to assess models on data preserving motion but removing shape/texture.

Result: Video-based models showed modest improvements in predicting IT responses but failed to generalize across conditions where object appearance was removed, unlike IT responses in macaques.

Conclusion: ANNs, especially in their current video-based forms, fail to capture appearance-invariant temporal computations shown by macaque IT, highlighting the need for better objectives in ANN modeling that align with biological dynamics.

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

*Jianke Zhang,Xiaoyu Chen,Qiuyue Wang,Mingsheng Li,Yanjiang Guo,Yucheng Hu,Jiajun Zhang,Shuai Bai,Junyang Lin,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the choice and competence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) impact Vision-Language-Action (VLA) performance, reveals gaps in assumptions about VLMs’ generalization, and offers insights for enhanced downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how pretrained VLMs translate to downstream embodied tasks and challenge common assumptions about their utility in control tasks.

Method: They introduce "VLM4VLA," a minimal adaptation pipeline requiring minor learnable parameters to assess the impact of VLM competence on various downstream tasks through empirical studies.

Result: VLMs consistently outperform scratch-trained alternatives, but general VLM competence poorly predicts control task performance. Vision components are identified as the main bottleneck, and injecting vision-relevant supervision boosts performance.

Conclusion: Standard VLM competence alone is insufficient for optimal embodied control. Improving vision encoder supervision is key to bridging the gap between pretraining objectives and action-planning needs.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a CNN-based image recognition system to classify white shrimp post-harvest, improving efficiency and product quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of freshness and product appearance in shrimp-based foods by automating the classification process.

Method: A deep learning-based CNN model is implemented for automated classification of freshly harvested white shrimp.

Result: The CNN model replaces manual sorting, increasing classification efficiency, accuracy, and consistency, while reducing processing time.

Conclusion: The approach enhances product quality and helps shrimp transportation businesses meet consumer expectations for freshness and appearance.

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [146] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes extending PCA to higher-order tensors and polynomial Gaussian approximations for creating improved rotation-invariant shape descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PCA-based methods for shape analysis only work effectively for simpler shapes, leaving more complex structures inadequately described.

Method: The paper enhances the standard PCA-based covariance matrix approach by introducing higher-order tensors and polynomial Gaussian approximations to encode more complex rotation-invariant shape features.

Result: The proposed approach enables the development of more accurate rotation-invariant shape descriptors and metrics for complex shapes.

Conclusion: This method provides a practical tool for tasks like molecular shape descriptions, object recognition, and shape similarity analysis, addressing complexities that simpler PCA models cannot handle.

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces MMErroR, a benchmark designed to evaluate Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) ability to detect and classify reasoning errors in multi-modal contexts, revealing significant challenges in their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can truly understand and detect reasoning errors within visual and linguistic contexts.

Method: Developed MMErroR, a benchmark with 2,013 samples featuring reasoning errors across diverse domains. It involves evaluating advanced VLMs' capacities to detect and classify error types beyond answer correctness.

Result: The evaluation of 20 advanced VLMs found that even the top-performing model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) correctly classified errors in only 66.47% of cases, showcasing the difficulty of detecting erroneous reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights that identifying and classifying reasoning errors remains challenging for VLMs, suggesting the need for improved reasoning capabilities in multi-modal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

*Yingyan Xu,Pramod Rao,Sebastian Weiss,Gaspard Zoss,Markus Gross,Christian Theobalt,Marc Habermann,Derek Bradley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model enabling photorealistic relighting without requiring complex OLAT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for high-quality relighting of 3D head avatars require OLAT data, which is restrictive. This paper aims to provide an approach that removes this dependency.

Method: The method comprises a two-stage process: (1) modeling flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting using diverse datasets and self-supervised lighting alignment, and (2) learning a mapping to reflectance parameters using a smaller dataset captured under OLAT.

Result: The approach achieves generalization across subjects, supports relighting from a single image, and allows novel view synthesis and realistic rendering of digital avatars.

Conclusion: The proposed model achieves relighting capabilities comparable to OLAT-based captures, while also enabling applications with minimal data requirements, opening opportunities for efficient digital avatar generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents HairGuard, a framework for recovering fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks, using novel methods for depth refinement, view synthesis, and integration with existing depth models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D vision struggles to handle soft boundaries like thin hairs due to the ambiguous blending of foreground and background. Solving this issue enhances the realism and accuracy of depth estimation, image synthesis, and other vision tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a data curation pipeline based on image matting datasets, a depth fixer network with a gated residual module to refine depth around soft boundaries, and a depth-based forward warping approach followed by generative scene painting and adaptive color fusion.

Result: HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance in monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, particularly improving soft boundary handling.

Conclusion: HairGuard enhances 3D vision accuracy by effectively recovering soft boundary details, offering improvements across various tasks and enabling seamless integration with existing depth models.

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RiskCueBench, a benchmark for assessing video risk prediction by emphasizing early risk signal detection rather than relying on full video exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing prevalence of video-focused social media, identifying risky events from visual data can enhance public safety and accident prevention. Existing datasets often oversimplify this task by granting access to entire video sequences, necessitating a more realistic approach.

Method: The authors introduce RiskCueBench, a benchmark dataset where videos are annotated with specific risk signal clips representing the first indication of potential safety concerns, aiming to reflect real-world scenarios better.

Result: Experimental analysis demonstrates that current video risk prediction models struggle with identifying early risk signals and anticipating risky events, revealing a significant performance gap.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the challenges in developing practical video risk assessment models, emphasizing the need for improvements in early visual signal interpretation to predict risky events effectively in real-world conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates superior performance in Deepfake detection and robust generalization across datasets, advancing the field of trust in digital spaces.

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new benchmark called Eye-Q to test Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging visual puzzles requiring deep reasoning and inferential understanding, revealing their significant limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on standard benchmarks, they often rely on surface-level recognition. This work aims to evaluate deeper reasoning capabilities with complex, implicit visual puzzles.

Method: The authors create 'Eye-Q,' a benchmark with 1,343 multilingual visual word puzzles involving abstract reasoning and associative inference, assessing models under a human-aligned evaluation protocol.

Result: Current state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 60.27% accuracy on this challenging benchmark, revealing substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of current VLMs in handling complex visual reasoning and infers that current methodologies lack the ability to construct adequate conceptual representations for deep image-to-phrase inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

*Xiangdong Hu,Yangyang Jiang,Qin Hu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAMBIT, a framework exploiting multimodal large language models' reasoning capabilities to influence safety alignment, achieving high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure models can effectively resist adversarial attacks targeting safety mechanisms.

Method: Develop and employ GAMBIT, which combines harmful visual semantics with gamified reasoning tasks to bypass safety checks.

Result: GAMBIT demonstrates high Attack Success Rates on various reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs, outperforming existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively challenges MLLMs' safety alignment, highlighting vulnerabilities in reasoning-enabled model structures.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query.

TL;DR: WeedRepFormer is an efficient Vision Transformer achieving high segmentation and gender classification accuracy for waterhemp using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing feature extraction for biological classification with the need for real-time efficiency in agricultural models.

Method: WeedRepFormer integrates structural reparameterization in a Vision Transformer backbone, Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a reparameterizable classification head to optimize performance.

Result: Achieved 92.18% mIoU for segmentation, 81.91% gender classification accuracy, and operates at 108.95 FPS with 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs.

Conclusion: WeedRepFormer sets a new performance benchmark in agricultural AI with superior accuracy, efficiency, and reduced computational cost.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

*Zeyu Dong,Yimin Zhu,Yu Wu,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FROST-Drive introduces a novel E2E architecture for autonomous driving using a frozen vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for enhanced generalization and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of limited generalization in E2E autonomous driving models, which arises from over-specialization when vision encoders are fully fine-tuned on driving datasets.

Method: FROST-Drive employs a frozen vision encoder from VLM to preserve general knowledge, integrates it with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion, and uses a GRU-based decoder for waypoint generation alongside a custom RFS-optimized loss function.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo Open E2E dataset show that the frozen encoder-based approach significantly outperforms models with fully fine-tuned encoders, especially in complex driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Maintaining the generalized knowledge of pretrained VLMs is a better strategy for robust and generalizable autonomous driving than full fine-tuning, paving the way for improved vision-based models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures structural relationships and enhances practical utility in cold-start scenarios through a tunable scoring parameter.

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

*Hengjia Li,Liming Jiang,Qing Yan,Yizhi Song,Hao Kang,Zichuan Liu,Xin Lu,Boxi Wu,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric reinforcement learning framework improving reasoning-driven image editing by decoupling reasoning from image generation and enhancing exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing models struggle with reasoning-centric edits and current reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are limited by reasoning constraints, biased reward systems, and unstable instruction-based rewards.

Method: The authors propose ThinkRL-Edit, which incorporates Chain-of-Thought-based reasoning, unbiased reward grouping across dimensions, and binary checklist-based reward systems for better reasoning exploration and reward accuracy.

Result: ThinkRL-Edit significantly improves reasoning-centric image editing performance, yielding outputs that are instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded.

Conclusion: ThinkRL-Edit successfully addresses the challenges in reasoning-focused image editing, enhancing reasoning exploration and overcoming previous RL limitations to produce more precise and interpretable results.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

*Yunqi Hong,Kuei-Chun Kao,Hengguang Zhou,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies and tackles reward hacking in reinforcement learning post-training for text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address imperfections in current reward functions used for improving text-to-image models, which lead to reward hacking issues like unrealistic or low-quality images.

Method: The paper introduces a lightweight artifact reward model trained on a curated dataset, aiming to regularize rewards and mitigate reward hacking in existing RL pipelines.

Result: Integrating the artifact reward improves image quality and reduces reward hacking across multiple RL setups.

Conclusion: Enhancing text-to-image RL with the proposed artifact reward model effectively mitigates reward hacking and ensures better image quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

*Yuzhe Sun,Zhe Dong,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-guided framework for more reliable remote sensing image segmentation based on natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve challenges in cross-modal alignment for remote sensing image segmentation, such as extreme scale variations and intricate boundaries.

Method: The authors propose an uncertainty-guided framework, introducing Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS), Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF), and Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR).

Result: Experiments show that the approach significantly improves segmentation robustness and geometric fidelity without altering the backbone architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses spatial non-uniformity in cross-modal alignment for image segmentation and enhances performance with adaptive inference strategies.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by introducing a training-free algorithm (SDCD) to counteract texture-driven biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fix object hallucination in LVLMs, which happens due to visual statistical bias where local texture features are prioritized over geometric structures.

Method: The authors propose a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which calibrates output distributions by penalizing tokens with high confidence in disrupted visual structures.

Result: SDCD successfully reduces hallucinations on various benchmarks and improves LVLMs' multimodal performance.

Conclusion: By addressing texture biases with SDCD, the paper significantly reduces hallucination issues, advancing the effectiveness of LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which enhances semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds by transferring appearance-aware attributes from Gaussian Splatting to tackle challenges of sparse geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of point clouds has been hindered due to sparse 3D geometry and lack of appearance-based features, reducing performance for objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances.

Method: The researchers establish a point-wise correspondence between optimized Gaussians and point geometry, leveraging Gaussian attributes like opacity and scale to address geometric ambiguities and improve boundary localization.

Result: Experiments reveal state-of-the-art performance and significant improvements in handling geometrically challenging classes on standard benchmarks, without reliance on 2D or language supervision.

Conclusion: G2P demonstrates effective enhancement in semantic segmentation by incorporating appearance-aware attributes to resolve limitations of geometry-only features, making it a valuable contribution to 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

TL;DR: This study explores how depth backbones and feature engineering affect monocular 3D object detection, focusing on Pseudo-LiDAR pipelines using KITTI dataset benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection is a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR, but its accuracy is limited by challenges in estimating metric depth from single images.

Method: The paper evaluates two depth backbones (NeWCRFs and Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor) under a Pseudo-LiDAR and PointRCNN detection framework, tests point-cloud augmentations, and analyzes depth accuracy across distances using ground-truth 2D boxes.

Result: NeWCRFs outperformed in downstream 3D detection with 10.50% AP$_{3D}$ on Moderate split with IoU=0.7. Augmentations using semantic and grayscale intensity offered marginal gains, while mask-based sampling detrimentally reduced performance.

Conclusion: Depth backbone selection and geometric fidelity are crucial to improving monocular 3D detection performance. Secondary feature additions have limited impact, and semantic augmentation requires careful consideration.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

### [165] [Semantic Belief-State World Model for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03517)
*Sarim Chaudhry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) for human motion prediction, reconfiguring the problem as a latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold to improve stability and accuracy in long-term motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human motion prediction suffer from issues like compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty due to their inadequate separation of observation reconstruction from dynamics modeling.

Method: The proposed SBWM model introduces a probabilistic belief state aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. It uses stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to simulate motion dynamics without being influenced by static geometry or noise.

Result: The SBWM demonstrates stable, coherent long-horizon motion rollouts with competitive accuracy at a lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Reframing human motion prediction as a world model's latent state evolution enhances predictive stability and radically impacts how human motion is simulated and forecasted.

Abstract: Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDENeRF, a method for improving monocular depth estimation by combining initial depth estimates with depth details from Neural Radiance Fields, leading to better depth maps with fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of smooth but detail-lacking depth maps in existing monocular depth estimation methods, which are critical for tasks requiring precise scene understanding such as autonomous navigation and extended reality.

Method: The authors introduced MDENeRF, a three-step approach: (1) generating a monocular depth estimate for overall structure, (2) training a NeRF with perturbed viewpoints and deriving per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) fusing the monocular and NeRF depths using Bayesian fusion to incorporate high-frequency details iteratively.

Result: Their method achieves superior metrics and performance in experiments focused on indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing monocular depth estimation.

Conclusion: MDENeRF effectively combines global structure from monocular priors and fine details from NeRFs to generate refined depth maps, advancing the capability of monocular depth estimation methods in applications requiring precise scene understanding.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

TL;DR: PCNet enhances thermal UAV image super-resolution using optical guidance and physics-based constraints, achieving improved reconstruction quality and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution encounter issues such as loss of high-frequency information and artifacts due to differences in imaging physics between optical and thermal modalities.

Method: PCNet introduces CRME for cross-resolution mutual enhancement and PDTM for embedding heat conduction properties alongside a temperature consistency loss to ensure realistic thermal images.

Result: PCNet demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality and downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection on the VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed PCNet framework effectively addresses challenges in optical and thermal modality alignment for UAV image super-resolution, proving robust and efficient in various applications.

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Motivation: The paper targets challenges in generating diverse 4D scene dynamics, moving away from labor-intensive rule-based approaches and the dependency on massive, category-limited datasets.

Method: The pipeline leverages a distillation-based approach to extract Lagrangian motion data from Eulerian representations in 2D videos, ensuring category-agnostic generative capabilities.

Result: CHORD successfully generates diverse 4D dynamics involving multi-body interactions and outperforms existing methods. It is also demonstrated in robotics manipulation policy generation.

Conclusion: This universal and versatile pipeline provides scalable solutions for creating dynamic 4D scenes, addressing limitations of previous methods and opening up new avenues in scene synthesis and robotic applications.

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

### [170] [EASLT: Emotion-Aware Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03549)
*Guobin Tu,Di Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASLT improves sign language translation by integrating facial expressions as key semantic anchors through a dedicated emotional encoder and fusion module. It achieves strong results on PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLT methods emphasize manual gestures but neglect facial expressions, leading to semantic ambiguity when similar gestures represent distinct concepts.

Method: EASLT uses an emotional encoder to capture affective dynamics and an Emotion-Aware Fusion module to recalibrate sign features based on emotional context.

Result: Achieved BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 (PHOENIX14T) and 22.80 (CSL-Daily), along with BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, outperforming other gloss-free SLT methods.

Conclusion: Emotion-aware modeling enhances translation fidelity, resolving semantic ambiguities effectively and advancing the field of SLT.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

*Tianyi Shang,Pengjie Xu,Zhaojun Deng,Zhenyu Li,Zhicong Chen,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatiaLoc utilizes spatial relationship modeling for cross-modal localization between text and point clouds, demonstrating superior performance on the KITTI360Pose dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses cross-modal localization to enable robots to interpret natural language instructions for autonomous navigation by leveraging spatial relationships between text and point clouds.

Method: Employs a coarse-to-fine strategy: BEOSE models spatial relationships using Bezier curves at instance-level, FAE explores global-level relationships in the frequency domain, and UGFL predicts 2D positions through uncertainty-aware Gaussian modeling.

Result: Experiments on KITTI360Pose show SpatiaLoc achieves significant performance improvements over current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc demonstrates the efficacy of spatial relationship modeling in improving cross-modal localization tasks, highlighting its potential in advancing human-robot interaction and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Yakun Niu,Yingjian Chen,Lei Zhang*

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting AI-generated images, especially generalizing to unseen generative models, and proposes an effective method using a fine-tuning strategy on CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the rise of AI-generated images posing threats like misinformation and public distrust, highlighting the need for generalized detection methods.

Method: The method involves a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy with a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism that attends to distributional deviations during fine-tuning of the CLIP image encoder.

Result: The proposed method achieves enhanced detection performance, with up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed MPFT strategy effectively enhances the generalization ability of the CLIP image encoder, surpassing existing methods in AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiT-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) spatial reasoning capabilities without visual inputs, revealing a gap in global spatial consistency and proposing improvements with explicit spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether spatial intelligence originates from the visual encoders or from reasoning backbones in AI models, and to advance the assessment and development of spatially-grounded language models.

Method: Developed SiT-Bench, a benchmark containing over 3,800 expert-annotated tasks across five categories and 17 subtasks, which convert visual scenes into textual descriptions for symbolic reasoning by LLMs.

Result: Findings show LLMs perform well in localized semantic tasks but struggle with global spatial consistency; explicit spatial reasoning enhances model performance, revealing latent world-modeling potential.

Conclusion: SiT-Bench provides a valuable resource for improving spatial reasoning capabilities in LLMs, paving the way for better VLMs and embodied agents in the future.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

### [174] [Adaptive Attention Distillation for Robust Few-Shot Segmentation under Environmental Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03596)
*Qianyu Guo,Jingrong Wu,Jieji Ren,Weifeng Ge,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an environment-robust few-shot segmentation (FSS) framework suitable for challenging real-world conditions and proposes an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method, significantly enhancing segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSS studies are largely focused on laboratory conditions and don't address challenges like motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets, hindering real-world application.

Method: The paper proposes the Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method, which contrasts and distills semantics between support and query images to derive class-specific attention, improving segmentation in complex settings.

Result: AAD demonstrates a substantial improvement in mIoU (3.3%-8.5%) across diverse datasets and environments, suggesting enhanced generalization and robust performance.

Conclusion: This paper bridges gaps in current FSS studies by introducing environment-robust settings and benchmarks, offering an effective solution for real-world deployment through AAD. The source code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

### [175] [Unveiling Text in Challenging Stone Inscriptions: A Character-Context-Aware Patching Strategy for Binarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03609)
*Pratyush Jena,Amal Joseph,Arnav Sharma,Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a methodology for binarizing stone inscriptions using Attention U-Net and a novel patching strategy to address challenges like surface degradation and variable text layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing binarization techniques struggle with poor contrast, noise, and layout irregularities in historical stone inscriptions.

Method: They develop an adaptive patching strategy and an Attention U-Net model that focuses on structural cues, combined with dynamic patch sampling and selection.

Result: Their model achieves significant performance improvements and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across scripts, both Indic and non-Indic.

Conclusion: The approach provides clean binarized outputs, facilitating downstream tasks such as text analysis, OCR, and script identification across various languages and artifacts.

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel object classification technique that eliminates the need for object alignment by sorting features derived from convex segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of classification techniques that require object alignment, which can be computationally complex and restrictive.

Method: The method normalizes object boundaries, segments them into approximate convex parts, then sorts them by length. A set of features (segment length, extreme points, area, base, and width) measures boundary similarity.

Result: The proposed method is tested on datasets and produces acceptable classificatory results.

Conclusion: Sorting features from convex segments effectively replaces object alignment for classification, offering a simpler and efficient alternative.

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MFC-RFNet, a novel generative network for improving high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar data, addressing challenges like multi-scale modeling, feature misalignment, and long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately perform precipitation nowcasting for disaster mitigation and economic planning by addressing challenges in multi-scale evolution modeling, inter-frame feature alignment, and capturing long-range spatiotemporal context.

Method: The MFC-RFNet framework integrates multi-scale communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion using components like Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection, Feature Communication Module, and Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion. It also incorporates Vision-RWKV blocks and uses rectified flow training.

Result: MFC-RFNet demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines in four datasets, delivering clearer radar echo morphologies and better prediction at high rain thresholds and long prediction ranges.

Conclusion: The proposed MFC-RFNet synergizes advanced modeling techniques to offer effective and reliable radar-based nowcasting, enabling better disaster preparedness and planning.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrackSegFlow, a synthesis framework for creating photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks with precise mask-image alignment, improving crack segmentation's scalability despite domain shifts and limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated crack segmentation faces challenges due to scarce pixel-level labeling and domain shifts across various conditions (sensors, textures, illumination, etc.), requiring advanced solutions for scalable condition assessment.

Method: CrackSegFlow employs topology-preserving mask injection and boundary-gated modulation to generate aligned crack images; paired crack masks are synthesized with coverage control, diversifying data while reducing annotation efforts and false positives.

Result: Experiments on various asphalt and concrete datasets show significant improvement in segmentation performance, both in in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, with a newly developed dataset of 50,000 paired crack images aiding large-scale benchmarking.

Conclusion: CrackSegFlow enhances segmentation performance, addressing challenges in pixel-level labels and domain shifts. It demonstrates better quality than diffusion-based methods for thin-structure cracks and offers scalability with the release of the CSF-50K dataset.

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

TL;DR: VideoMemory introduces an entity-centric framework with Dynamic Memory Bank for improving video consistency and identity retention across scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models face challenges in maintaining consistency of characters, props, and environments across multiple shots and long-form narratives.

Method: VideoMemory uses a Dynamic Memory Bank that stores and retrieves explicit visual and semantic descriptors, combined with structured script-based narrative planning and multi-agent systems to synthesize consistent videos.

Result: VideoMemory maintains strong entity-level coherence and achieves high-quality video generation in both visual and narrative aspects, validated through a custom benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed memory-framework enhances the ability of video generation models to create consistent, coherent long-form narratives by effectively managing entity identity and appearance.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed MGPC outperforms existing methods and generalizes effectively to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: MGPC demonstrates improved robustness, scalability, and performance in point cloud completion by leveraging multimodal inputs and novel architectural components.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Motivation: To address the existing limitations in video generation models, such as unnatural object interactions and physics inconsistencies.

Method: Developed PhysVideoGenerator: integrates physics tokens predicted by a lightweight PredictorP network into DiT-based generator Latte via cross-attention, using pre-trained V-JEPA 2 representations.

Result: Demonstrated the framework’s feasibility by showing diffusion latents can recover V-JEPA 2 physical features and that multi-task optimization remains stable.

Conclusion: PhysVideoGenerator provides a proof-of-concept for embedding learnable physics in generative video models, establishing groundwork for further refinement and scaling.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel egocentric action recognition method using 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue, significantly improving accuracy without reliance on hand, object, or interaction region detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in existing egocentric action recognition methods that mainly depend on RGB appearance or human pose estimation, by exploring an alternative motion representation with 2D point tracks.

Method: The proposed method uses CoTracker to generate trajectories of randomly initialized image points across video frames and inputs these tracks, along with image frames, into a Transformer-based recognition model.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in recognition accuracy when integrating 2D point tracks, even with limited video information (e.g., only the first frame).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that 2D point tracks offer a lightweight and effective motion representation, consistently improving egocentric action recognition performance.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework leveraging vision-language models and geometric registration for 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization, addressing data scarcity, fine-grained pose regression, and computational latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in applying vision-language models to endoscopic camera localization, including scarcity of specialized datasets, fine-grained pose estimation, and high latency in temporal feature extraction.

Method: The authors developed the BREATH dataset, an in-vivo endoscopic dataset. They introduced BREATH-VL, integrating vision-language semantic cues and geometric registration for precise localization, and proposed a lightweight temporal context encoding mechanism using linguistic prompts.

Result: BREATH-VL significantly outperformed state-of-the-art localization methods, reducing translational error by 25.5% with competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: BREATH-VL demonstrates a successful combination of VLMs and geometric methods, achieving robust and efficient localization performance in complex surgical scenes.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve domain adaptation for training models in optical system assembly, reducing dependency on labor-intensive real-world labeled data by using minimal unlabeled images and a novel self-supervised approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between simulation data and real-world images in large-scale optical system assembly, which hampers the generalization capability of simulation-trained models.

Method: The proposed Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3) integrates an autoregressive domain transformation generator with an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy, utilizing self-supervised learning to extract domain-invariant features for robust misalignment prediction.

Result: DA3 improved accuracy by 46% compared to a simulation-only pipeline and achieved comparable performance to real-world labeled data collection, while reducing data collection time by 98.7%.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation via DA3 validates the digital-twin pipeline as an efficient solution for enhancing large-scale optical assembly, proving its practical application in reducing effort and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSMCIR, a unified representation framework to address representation space fragmentation in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance through alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Composed Image Retrieval methods are hindered by mismatched representation spaces due to using separate encoders for different modalities. This limits retrieval efficiency.

Method: CSMCIR employs three components: (1) Multi-level Chain-of-Thought prompting for generating semantically compatible captions, (2) symmetric dual-tower architecture using shared Q-Former for uniform cross-modal encoding, and (3) entropy-based Memory Bank strategy for dynamic generation of negative samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance and training efficiency of CSMCIR compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CSMCIR effectively addresses representation misalignment issues in CIR, improving performance and efficiency, validated through experimental results and ablations.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATANet enhances marine species classification using taxonomy and environmental context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook environmental interactions and taxonomy in marine species classification.

Method: Introduces MATANet with two modules: MCEAM for contextual learning and HSLM for taxonomic integration.

Result: MATANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple marine datasets.

Conclusion: Combining environmental cues and taxonomic hierarchy boosts fine-grained classification of marine species.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadDiff, a system for comparing radiology image sets to identify clinically significant differences using multimodal reasoning and innovative diagnostic workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding differences between radiology studies and improving insights from medical AI systems.

Method: RadDiff utilizes a proposer-ranker framework, vision-language models, multimodal reasoning, iterative refinement, and targeted visual search for improved diagnostic comparison.

Result: RadDiff achieves up to 50% accuracy on the RadDiffBench benchmark, outperforming baseline methods, and showcases versatility in analyzing clinical tasks like COVID-19 phenotypes and survival-related imaging features.

Conclusion: RadDiff and RadDiffBench establish novel methods and benchmarks for systematically identifying meaningful differences in radiological data in clinical and research contexts.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the difficulty of detecting camouflaged objects using RGB imaging by proposing HyperCOD, a benchmark for hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD), and introduces a novel model, HSC-SAM, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in camouflaged object detection (COD) caused by ambiguous color and texture cues in RGB-based methods, and to establish a foundation for HCOD by introducing a dedicated hyperspectral dataset.

Method: The authors introduce the HyperCOD benchmark with 350 hyperspectral images and propose the HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM), which reformulates hyperspectral images into spatial and spectral maps processed by the SAM model.

Result: The HSC-SAM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly introduced HyperCOD dataset and demonstrates robust generalization to other public hyperspectral imaging (HSI) datasets.

Conclusion: The HyperCOD dataset and HSC-SAM model advance the field of hyperspectral camouflaged object detection, establishing a robust foundation for further research and innovation.

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I2E, a novel image editing paradigm using a structured "Decompose-then-Action" approach to overcome limitations in existing pixel-level text-guided image-editing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing methods struggle with complex compositional edits requiring precise control and spatial reasoning due to implicit, unstructured processes.

Method: I2E operates in two stages: 1) Decomposing images into manipulable object layers, and 2) Using a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to perform stepwise edits.

Result: I2E demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on I2E-Bench and public benchmarks in handling complex instructions and ensuring edit precision.

Conclusion: The I2E paradigm ensures more accurate compositional editing tasks with object-based modeling, surpassing traditional pixel-centric approaches in performance and stability.

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

*Xiaokun Sun,Zezhong Wu,Zewen Ding,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Masked Video Prediction (MVP)", a post-training paradigm for Video LLMs to improve temporal reasoning and causal understanding by reconstructing masked video segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs, although successful in visual-semantic tasks, lack explicit supervision for capturing temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations, limiting their capability to model intricate dynamics and visual causality.

Method: The authors propose MVP, where the model reconstructs masked video segments amidst distractors, supported by a scalable data synthesis pipeline. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied for fine-tuned temporal context understanding.

Result: The MVP framework significantly enhances video reasoning, especially in temporal reasoning and causal understanding, as validated through comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: MVP closes the gap in temporal coherence and inter-frame causality in VideoLLMs, bolstering their video reasoning abilities through explicit temporal and causal task optimizations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

TL;DR: A study exploring alternative methods to generate synthetic datasets for AI model training in the agricultural industry, focusing on object detection for separating stones and potatoes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of creating synthetic data in the agricultural industry, where CAD models are not readily available, affecting AI training for cost reduction and production efficiency.

Method: The authors evaluate alternative techniques for generating synthetic datasets using highly representative 3D models (through scanning or image-to-3D methods) and examine the effect of finetuning with small real datasets.

Result: Highly representative 3D models can effectively generate synthetic data for object detection AI training, and finetuning on real datasets significantly improves model performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data from representative 3D models combined with finetuning on small real datasets is a viable approach for training AI models in environments lacking CAD files.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

*Usha Shrestha,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a closed-loop, performance-aware solution for augmenting code synthesis in large language models (LLMs), reducing brute-force discovery efforts while improving efficiency using empirical performance cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and brute-force nature of current data-augmentation strategies in code synthesis by enabling LLMs to autonomously create optimal transformations using performance feedback.

Method: The authors fine-tuned LLMs using Low-Rank Adaptation on a repository of over 6,000 empirically evaluated augmentation functions annotated by model performance. Pairwise ordering of transformations guided the training, avoiding the use of reinforcement learning or explicit symbolic objectives.

Result: Their approach achieved comparable peak accuracy with significantly fewer candidate evaluations (up to 600x reduction in brute-force discovery), while demonstrating that LLMs could reason about task performance through empirical cues rather than memorization.

Conclusion: The study presents a significant advance in enabling LLMs to autonomously design task-aligned augmentations through empirical performance reasoning, without relying on symbolic rewards or structured instructions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

*Wei Long,Haifeng Wu,Shiyin Jiang,Jinhua Zhang,Xinchun Ji,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDESplat addresses limitations in depth estimation for 3D Gaussian splatting by proposing an iterative process with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for depth estimation in scene reconstruction are unstable and coarse, limiting their ability to utilize geometric cues across views effectively.

Method: IDESplat uses a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that iteratively refines depth estimation by cascading warp operations to enhance Gaussian mean prediction. Multiple DPBUs are stacked for progressive refinement.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming DepthSplat in terms of PSNR on multiple datasets while remaining memory-efficient and parameter-light.

Conclusion: IDESplat offers a robust and generalizable approach for depth estimation and scene reconstruction with improved accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods in India significantly impact crops, requiring accurate assessments for effective relief distribution and post-disaster agricultural planning.

Method: FLNet uses deep learning and super-resolution to upgrade Sentinel-2 imagery from 10 m to 3 m resolution before applying damage classification.

Result: FLNet achieves a critical "Full Damage" F1-score of 0.89, matching high-resolution commercial imagery, using the BFCD-22 dataset.

Conclusion: FLNet provides a cost-effective and scalable solution, demonstrating the feasibility of transitioning to automated damage assessment at a national level.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

Conclusion: HemBLIP represents a step forward in applying vision-language models for scalable, interpretable hematological diagnostics, promoting greater trust and usability in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Microscopic evaluation of white blood cell morphology is central to leukemia diagnosis, yet current deep learning models often act as black boxes, limiting clinical trust and adoption. We introduce HemBLIP, a vision language model designed to generate interpretable, morphology aware descriptions of peripheral blood cells. Using a newly constructed dataset of 14k healthy and leukemic cells paired with expert-derived attribute captions, we adapt a general-purpose VLM via both full fine-tuning and LoRA based parameter efficient training, and benchmark against the biomedical foundation model MedGEMMA. HemBLIP achieves higher caption quality and morphological accuracy, while LoRA adaptation provides further gains with significantly reduced computational cost. These results highlight the promise of vision language models for transparent and scalable hematological diagnostics.

*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FocusUI, an efficient framework for UI grounding that improves performance and computational efficiency by selecting relevant visual tokens and maintaining positional continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with high-resolution UI screenshots due to excessive visual tokens leading to diluted attention and computational overhead. FocusUI aims to enhance efficiency and grounding precision in UI applications.

Method: FocusUI eliminates redundant visual tokens using a fusion of instruction-conditioned scoring and UI-graph-based scoring, and uses a PosPad strategy to compress dropped tokens while maintaining positional continuity.

Result: FocusUI demonstrates improved performance, faster inference speed, and reduced GPU memory usage across benchmarks, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: FocusUI effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in UI grounding tasks, representing an advance in high-resolution screenshot processing methodologies.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

*Xu Zhang,Cheng Da,Huan Yang,Kun Gai,Ming Lu,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer designed to enhance autoregressive image generation by incorporating hierarchical and residual network designs specific to vision, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 1D visual tokenizers in autoregressive generation primarily replicate text model designs, neglecting vision-specific hierarchical and residual properties crucial for efficiency and convergence in visual models.

Method: This work proposes ResTok, a tokenizer that utilizes hierarchical residual designs for image and latent tokens, enabling cross-level feature fusion and concentrated latent distributions for autoregressive modeling. Additionally, it employs a hierarchical AR generator to speed up image generation by predicting a whole level of latent tokens at once instead of token-by-token.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves autoregressive image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical and residual designs into visual tokenizers restores vital vision properties, leading to enhanced performance and efficiency in autoregressive visual data modeling.

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

### [199] [FUSION: Full-Body Unified Motion Prior for Body and Hands via Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03959)
*Enes Duran,Nikos Athanasiou,Muhammed Kocabas,Michael J. Black,Omid Taheri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion-based model, FUSION, for generating realistic full-body motions, including detailed hand articulation, by combining hand and body motion datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion synthesis methods lack the integration of detailed hand movements with full-body motion, and existing datasets are either limited in diversity or lack comprehensive full-body and hand-data coverage.

Method: The researchers unified existing hand and body motion datasets to create full-body motion sequences, then proposed FUSION, a diffusion-based model that predicts joint full-body and hand movements. Task-specific refinements are achieved using latent space optimization.

Result: FUSION outperformed state-of-the-art models on motion representation tasks, achieved natural motion generation, and showcased precise hand-motion control in specialized applications.

Conclusion: FUSION establishes a superior framework for full-body motion synthesis, paving the way for advancements in human-computer interactions and motion generation tasks.

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in automated poster design systems, including inaccurate text rendering, incomplete workflows, and lack of flexibility for commercial use.

Method: The solution, PosterVerse, involves three stages: blueprint creation using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), graphical background generation via diffusion models, and high-accuracy text rendering through an HTML engine. The approach utilizes a newly introduced PosterDNA dataset for training and validation.

Result: PosterVerse generates visually appealing, professional-grade posters with precise text alignment and customizable layouts. PosterDNA supports scalable training and resolves text rendering issues.

Conclusion: PosterVerse successfully automates the complete poster design workflow at a commercial standard, proving to be effective for design automation.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

### [201] [Padé Neurons for Efficient Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04005)
*Onur Keleş,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), which enhances neural network performance through stronger and diverse non-linearities, replacing existing neurons in more efficient ways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the non-linearity of neurons in neural networks, addressing the limitations of commonly used linear models with point-wise non-linear activation. Existing models, while offering some non-linearity, don't utilize the potential of functions like Padé approximants.

Method: The authors introduce Paons, which exploit Padé approximants to learn diverse non-linear functions of their inputs. These neurons incorporate all previously proposed neuron models as special cases and allow for efficient network designs with fewer layers.

Result: Implementing Paons in neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification tasks based on ResNet architecture demonstrates equal or superior performance with fewer layers. Comprehensive experiments validate their efficacy.

Conclusion: Paons provide a significant advancement in neuron modeling by offering diverse and stronger non-linearities in neural networks. They achieve better efficiency, can replace existing neurons, and are applicable widely. The PyTorch code is made available for further research.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

*Yuan Wang,Borui Liao,Huijuan Huang,Jinda Lu,Ouxiang Li,Kuien Liu,Meng Wang,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces REACT, a reward model for detecting structural distortions in text-to-video generated outputs, using a frame-level approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video generation models often fail to evaluate and address structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances or interactions, which compromise overall video quality.

Method: The authors build a large annotated dataset for structural distortions and train REACT in two stages—supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. They also use a dynamic frame sampling during inference to efficiently identify distortions.

Result: REACT effectively detects structural distortions in generative videos, achieving accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable analyses that complement current reward models.

Conclusion: The proposed REACT model adds significant value by enabling precise and interpretable assessments of structural distortions, filling a critical gap in video quality evaluation models.

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

*Raül Pérez-Gonzalo,Riccardo Magro,Andreas Espersen,Antonio Agudo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient and annotation-light segmentation approach for wind turbine inspections by reframing segmentation as a binary region classification problem, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent and reliable inspection of wind turbines is important to prevent minor surface damages from affecting performance, but existing pixel-wise deep learning models require extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges.

Method: The proposed method reframes pixel-level segmentation into a binary region classification problem, employing a Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique with Adaptive Thresholding and Region Merging. A data augmentation method called RegionMix is introduced to enhance classification generalization.

Result: The new framework achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and generalizes effectively across different windfarms.

Conclusion: The study presents a scalable, annotation-efficient inspection framework for automating turbine blade segmentation, offering high accuracy and cross-site generalization.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

*Zitong Huang,Kaidong Zhang,Yukang Ding,Chao Gao,Rui Ding,Ying Chen,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LocalDPO, a post-training method improving text-to-video diffusion models by optimizing alignment at spatio-temporal regions with localized preference pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning text-to-video models with human preferences are inefficient and provide ambiguous global supervision.

Method: The authors propose LocalDPO, which uses high-quality videos and generates negative samples via localized corruption. It employs a region-aware loss to train models for alignment improvement without requiring external critic models or manual annotations.

Result: LocalDPO shows improved video fidelity, temporal coherence, and human preference scores over existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: LocalDPO is an effective and efficient solution for fine-grained alignment of video generation models with human preferences, setting a new standard for post-training alignment.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores reasoning failures in large multimodal models (LMMs) caused by textual inertia during video reasoning, proposing a new protocol to test and improve reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness issues in the reasoning chains of LMMs, specifically the identified failure mode of textual inertia, where models overlook visual evidence in favor of erroneous text.

Method: The paper develops the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol to systematically identify and evaluate textual hallucinations in LMMs. It also proposes Active Visual-Context Refinement, an inference paradigm to prevent hallucination propagation using visual re-grounding and adaptive reasoning adjustment strategies.

Result: The results reveal that without intervention, LMMs self-correct in less than 10% of cases but, with the proposed method, reasoning robustness and error handling improve significantly.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a critical reasoning limitation in LMMs and offers an effective solution to enhance their performance by mitigating textual inertia and improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve scene-level 3D generation by integrating reconstruction models with generative video diffusion models.

Method: Gen3R repurposes VGGT reconstruction to generate geometric latents and aligns them with appearance latents of video diffusion models. This coupling enables joint generation of 3D geometry and videos.

Result: Gen3R achieves state-of-the-art results in both single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation while boosting robustness of reconstruction.

Conclusion: The method effectively merges reconstruction and generative models, leading to advancements in 3D scene generation and robustness.

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

TL;DR: GeoReason addresses logical hallucinations in RS-VLMs through a dedicated framework combining dataset construction and a two-stage training strategy to improve reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS-VLMs lack cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks due to logical flaws such as hallucinated reasoning and reliance on shortcuts.

Method: GeoReason consists of constructing GeoReason-Bench, a dataset with reasoning trajectories, and a two-stage training strategy involving supervised knowledge initialization and reinforcement learning with logical consistency rewards.

Result: GeoReason significantly enhances deductive reliability and interpretability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in RS-VLM tasks.

Conclusion: The framework improves strategic spatial decision-making by anchoring answers in consistent reasoning, addressing logical deficits in RS-VLMs.

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal approach using pixel-wise 2D representations of satellite image time series (SITS) and proposes a self-supervision framework (PIMC) for improved Earth observation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often fail to effectively encode pixel-wise variations in satellite image time series data, which limits their performance in Earth observation tasks.

Method: The authors designed 2D recurrence plots as informative pixel-wise representations of vegetation indices from SITS and developed a multimodal self-supervised method, PIMC, to enhance feature extraction and encoder performance.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in SITS feature extraction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks like forecasting and land cover classification.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework demonstrates robust performance in Earth observation tasks, leveraging 2D representations and contrastive learning for superior self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Klear, an advanced system for audio-video joint generation that addresses challenges in alignment, generalization, and data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-video generation systems face issues like asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and degradation due to insufficient modeling and limited data.

Method: Klear employs a single-tower architecture with Omni-Full Attention, multitask training strategies, and a novel dataset with dense captions enabled by an automated construction pipeline.

Result: Klear delivers high-quality, semantically aligned audio-video generation that generalizes well, outperforming prior methods significantly and approaching Veo 3's performance.

Conclusion: Klear offers a scalable and unified solution to audio-video synthesis with groundbreaking advancements in alignment, generalization, and dataset quality.

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusion-DRF, a method that fine-tunes video diffusion models using differentiable feedback from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), improving video quality and text alignment without requiring extra reward models or datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing Text-to-Video generation often relies on non-differentiable preference training, requiring intensive labeling and prone to issues like bias, reward hacking, and unstable training.

Method: The proposed Diffusion-DRF method leverages differentiable reward flow from frozen Vision-Language Models through denoising updates, translating logit-level responses into aspect-structured, token-aware gradients. This approach includes gradient checkpointing for efficiency.

Result: Diffusion-DRF achieves superior video quality and text alignment, avoids reward hacking, and eliminates the need for additional reward models or training datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF is a model-agnostic and scalable solution that effectively fine-tunes video diffusion models, showing promise for generalized use in other generative tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToTMNet is a lightweight neural network for remote photoplethysmography using a Toeplitz operator for efficient long-range temporal filtering, achieving strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing methods for estimating blood volume pulse (BVP) from facial videos face computational inefficiencies due to attention-based temporal modeling and large parameter counts.

Method: The paper introduces ToTMNet, an architecture that employs an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer combined with gated depthwise temporal convolution to achieve efficient temporal filtering with a compact design.

Result: ToTMNet demonstrates strong heart-rate estimation accuracy on UBFC-rPPG and SCAMPS datasets, reaching low MAE and high Pearson correlation in both intra-dataset and synthetic-to-real evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is an efficient and practical alternative to attention mechanisms for remote photoplethysmography, although its applicability is limited by the use of only two datasets in this study.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach to visual localization using 2D image-based representations augmented with depth maps for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual localization systems either prioritize ease of maintenance with limited geometric reasoning (2D methods) or high accuracy with complex upkeep (3D methods). A gap exists in combining ease and accuracy effectively.

Method: A 2D image-based approach is enhanced with estimated depth maps, dense matchers for geometric reasoning, compact compression techniques, and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC for computational efficiency.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, surpassing other memory-efficient solutions while maintaining comparable map sizes.

Conclusion: This approach balances accuracy with efficiency in storage and computation, improving visual localization systems while being easy to build and maintain.

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

### [213] [Revisiting Speculative Leaderless Protocols for Low-Latency BFT Replication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03390)
*Daniel Qian,Xiyu Hao,Jinkun Geng,Yuncheng Yao,Aurojit Panda,Jinyang Li,Anirudh Sivaraman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol, reduces latency in permissioned blockchains with low contention using a sequencing layer for efficient operation, achieving fast commit times and high throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the latency challenges of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols for user-facing applications in permissioned blockchains, such as ensuring low latency even during slight contention.

Method: Aspen introduces a leaderless approach with a fast path method and utilizes a best-effort sequencing layer employing network delay estimates. It allows for efficient operation with additional replicas to ensure resilience and falls back to a PBFT-style mechanism when needed.

Result: The protocol achieves a near-optimal latency of 2Δ + ε, handling up to 3f + 2p + 1 replicas while supporting 19,000 requests per second and a significant latency improvement of 1.2 to 3.3x over prior methods.

Conclusion: Aspen demonstrates the feasibility of achieving low latency and high throughput in leaderless BFT protocols for permissioned blockchains, with fault tolerance and fallback mechanisms ensuring reliability and performance.

Abstract: As Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols begin to be used in permissioned blockchains for user-facing applications such as payments, it is crucial that they provide low latency. In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2Δ$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.
  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2Δ+ \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second.

*Francesco D'Amato,Roberto Saltini,Thanh-Hai Tran,Yann Vonlanthen,Luca Zanolini*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents Majorum, a consensus protocol that combines dynamic availability with partial synchronous finality to efficiently finalize blocks under optimistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome the limitations of existing dynamically available protocols, which struggle with strong safety guarantees during network partitions or asynchrony.

Method: Majorum is based on an ebb-and-flow construction combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol. It builds specifically on the quorum-based TOB-SVD protocol.

Result: Majorum demonstrates efficient block finalization under optimistic network conditions, finalizing blocks in as few as three slots and requiring only one voting phase per slot.

Conclusion: This protocol achieves both dynamic availability and strong safety guarantees under favorable conditions, making it a significant improvement for consensus mechanisms.

Abstract: Dynamic availability is the ability of a consensus protocol to remain live despite honest participants going offline and later rejoining. A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irrevocably finalizes a prefix.
  We present Majorum, an ebb-and-flow construction whose dynamically available component builds on a quorum-based protocol (TOB-SVD). Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot. In particular, when conditions remain favourable, each slot finalizes the next block extending the previously finalized one.

### [215] [A Scheduling Framework for Efficient MoE Inference on Edge GPU-NDP Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03992)
*Qi Wu,Chao Fang,Jiayuan Chen,Ye Lin,Yueqi Zhang,Yichuan Bai,Yuan Du,Li Du*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient framework for deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge-based GPU-NDP systems, addressing challenges like load imbalance, GPU underutilization, and data pre-profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize MoE model inference for edge deployment by overcoming issues of load imbalance, inefficient GPU utilization, and reliance on data pre-profiling in GPU-NDP systems with large memory requirements.

Method: The paper proposes three optimizations: exploiting tensor parallelism to partition expert computation, implementing a scheduling algorithm for load balancing, and developing a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy for efficient data handling.

Result: The proposed framework achieves an average of 2.41x and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to current approaches, significantly improving resource efficiency for MoE models.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient edge deployment of MoE models on GPU-NDP systems, solving major operational constraints and enhancing inference performance in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hummingbird, a GPU scheduling system that enhances SLO adherence and GPU efficiency on closed-source GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GPU-sharing techniques struggle to meet SLO adherence and maximize efficiency due to the lack of fine-grained scheduling on closed-source GPUs.

Method: Hummingbird enables microsecond-scale preemption and idle GPU time harvesting to improve task scheduling on closed-source GPUs.

Result: High-priority task SLO attainment increases by 9.7x and 3.5x compared to prior approaches, with minimal drop (<1%) when co-located with low-priority tasks, which also see a 2.4x throughput improvement.

Conclusion: Hummingbird effectively ensures SLO adherence and improves GPU utilization across various architectures.

Abstract: Existing GPU-sharing techniques, including spatial and temporal sharing, aim to improve utilization but face challenges in simultaneously ensuring SLO adherence and maximizing efficiency due to the lack of fine-grained task scheduling on closed-source GPUs. This paper presents Hummingbird, an SLO-oriented GPU scheduling system that overcomes these challenges by enabling microsecond-scale preemption on closed-source GPUs while effectively harvesting idle GPU time slices. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse GPU architectures reveal that Hummingbird improves the SLO attainment of high-priority tasks by 9.7x and 3.5x compared to the state-of-the-art spatial and temporal-sharing approaches. When compared to executing exclusively, the SLO attainment of the high-priority task, collocating with low-priority tasks on Hummingbird, only drops by less than 1%. Meanwhile, the throughput of the low-priority task outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal-sharing approaches by 2.4x. Hummingbird demonstrates significant effectiveness in ensuring the SLO while enhancing GPU utilization.

Motivation: Transformers are powerful but resource-intensive, creating challenges for deploying them on edge devices that require real-time performance.

Method: The study reviews and benchmarks lightweight transformer variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, etc., along with optimization techniques across hardware and software frameworks.

Result: Modern lightweight transformers achieve 75-96% accuracy with reductions in size (4-10x), latency (3-9x), and power consumption (2-5W), highlighting optimal strategies like sparse attention and mixed-precision quantization.

Conclusion: Efficient lightweight transformers are feasible for edge device deployment by leveraging advanced optimization techniques, and a practical deployment pipeline achieves significant model compression with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Method: A pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow was tested in four end-to-end case studies.

Result: One successful attempt led to an ML paper published at Agents4Science 2025 after passing human and AI reviews, identifying six recurring failure modes.

One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design. We conclude by discussing four design principles for more robust AI-scientist systems, implications for autonomous scientific discovery, and we release all prompts, artifacts, and outputs at https://github.com/Lossfunk/ai-scientist-artefacts-v1

### [220] [Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization for Efficient LLM Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03320)
*Yu Luo,Shuo Han,Yihan Hu,Dong Li,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method called $R^2VPO$ to improve policy optimization in reinforcement learning, addressing inefficiencies of current techniques like PPO and GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like PPO and GRPO face challenges due to their hard clipping mechanism, which suppresses valuable high-divergence gradients and leads to sample inefficiency as data becomes stale.

Method: The paper introduces $R^2VPO$, a framework based on a trust-region objective that uses variance of the policy ratio to softly constrain policy updates. This allows stable learning and reusing stale samples by reweighting them dynamically.

Result: $R^2VPO$ demonstrates superior performance, improving results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 17% gains over baselines and requiring 50% fewer rollouts to converge.

Conclusion: Ratio-variance control via $R^2VPO$ offers a significant advance in stability and data efficiency for reinforcement learning-based alignment of large language models.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

*Kun Zhao,Siyuan Dai,Pan Wang,Jifeng Song,Hui Ji,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan,Haoteng Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for radiology report generation, addressing issues like hallucinations and inefficiencies in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve radiology report generation by addressing architectural inconsistencies and reducing factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) common in existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Method: The authors propose a 'Reason-then-Summarize' architecture, incorporating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It uses a think block for findings and an answer block for labels, with a composite reward function to minimize logical inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark show state-of-the-art performance with superior clinical efficacy metrics and fewer hallucinations compared to supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a reliable and efficient solution for radiology report generation, enhancing both the accuracy and clinical validity of results.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

*Shanglin Li,Shiwen Chu,Okan Koç,Yi Ding,Qibin Zhao,Motoaki Kawanabe,Ziheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network for EEG decoding to address poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces often struggle with generalization across domains, limiting their utility. The paper aims to improve generalization by learning robust representations.

Method: HEEGNet integrates both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders, leveraging hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical encoding and introduces a coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy.

Result: Experiments on multiple EEG datasets show HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks including visual potentials and emotion recognition.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings and the hybrid architecture of HEEGNet provide an effective way to improve EEG decoding by leveraging hierarchical structures and addressing domain shifts.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [223] [Local Gradient Regulation Stabilizes Federated Learning under Client Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03584)
*Ping Luo,Jiahuan Wang,Ziqing Wen,Tao Sun,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of federated learning instability caused by statistical heterogeneity across clients. It proposes a method called Exploratory-Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR) to regulate local gradient dynamics and stabilize the learning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability in federated learning systems caused by client-side statistical heterogeneity, which distorts local gradient dynamics and impedes global convergence.

Method: The method involves regulating local gradient contributions through a client-side perspective without adding communication overhead. This approach is instantiated using the ECGR technique inspired by swarm intelligence, balancing gradient components for stabilizing updates.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments, including tests on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating gradient dynamics improves stability and performance of federated learning systems under heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that addressing local gradient dynamics is pivotal for stabilizing federated learning in heterogeneous environments, with ECGR being an effective approach.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RRE-PPO4Pred, a novel method that combines Reinforced Recurrent Encoders and a Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to enhance time series forecasting accuracy and outperform existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the forecasting accuracy and modeling capacity of RNNs for time series data, as conventional models treat all inputs equally, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: A Reinforced Recurrent Encoder framework improves RNNs through a Markov Decision Process, combined with an upgraded PPO4Pred algorithm using a Transformer-based agent to enhance temporal reasoning, and a co-evolutionary optimization approach for adaptive learning.

Result: Thorough testing on five real-world datasets shows that RRE-PPO4Pred outperforms baseline models and even state-of-the-art Transformer approaches in forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed RRE-PPO4Pred model significantly advances time series prediction by providing a robust and more accurate computational framework for engineering informatics.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an ordinal classification framework to improve wildfire severity predictions, with focus on rare yet critical occurrences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the prediction of extreme wildfire events aligned with operational decision-making in France.

Method: Developed neural models leveraging novel loss functions like TDeGPD loss and WKLoss, optimized for ordinal classification.

Result: Ordinal supervision significantly improved model performance, with WKLoss achieving the best results, though challenges remain for rare events.

Conclusion: Incorporating severity ordering, data imbalance, and seasonality improves wildfire forecasting, with further enhancements aimed at integrating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty into models.

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

*Noam Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes neural scaling laws in a model dealing with instance-difficulty and shows how learning relates to inference via failure rate and intrinsic difficulty distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to connect instance-difficulty in training data to inference performance and to provide a mathematical understanding of how generalization error and difficulty distributions interact.

Method: It presents the Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model where target variance is governed by a latent precision distribution. It connects generalization loss to pass@$k$ inference performance using a power-law decay framework.

Result: The study shows that learning reduces the hard tail of the error distribution, and pass@$k$ performance improves until reaching an intrinsic limit. Predictions are validated on simulations, CIFAR-10H, and a math teacher-student task.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how training impacts inference performance and suggest a compute-allocation strategy favoring training before pass@$k$ inference saturation.

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

### [228] [A Gap Between Decision Trees and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03919)
*Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work studies the relationship between geometric simplicity in decision boundaries (from decision trees) and their approximation by shallow neural networks. It examines when these methods conflict, focusing on the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the limitations and trade-offs between interpretability (simple geometric decision boundaries) and learning efficacy (approximating decision trees with shallow neural networks).

Method: Using the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, the study analyzes the complexity of decision boundaries generated by decision trees and their approximation via neural networks. It examines various smooth surrogates and maps out classification accuracy and complexity trade-offs.

Result: The study demonstrates that common surrogates (like ramp smoothing or sigmoidal smoothing) have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ dimensions above 1. It presents findings on how smooth barrier scores can recover decision sets with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Key bounds and conditions for achieving this are also provided.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with an analysis of trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, providing methods that ensure classification accuracy while controlling geometric complexity. This highlights the importance of threshold-based adjustments in achieving desired trade-offs.

Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.

### [229] [LUT-KAN: Segment-wise LUT Quantization for Fast KAN Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03332)
*Oleksandr Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) introduce learnable univariate functions instead of scalar weights, making inference computationally expensive. LUT-KAN uses lookup tables (LUT) with quantization techniques to optimize performance, ensuring accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN's design improves model accuracy and interpretability but lacks efficiency in CPU inference. Standard quantization methods cannot be applied effectively to spline-based calculations.

Method: LUT-KAN transforms edge functions in KAN into segment-wise lookup tables with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. It evaluates performance using an "honest baseline" methodology with experiments on various LUT resolutions and quantization schemes.

Result: LUT-KAN achieves classification quality preservation while significantly reducing CPU inference latency (12x under NumPy, 10x under Numba). However, it incurs memory overhead, notably at LUT resolution L=64.

Conclusion: LUT-KAN effectively optimizes KAN for CPU inference, balancing accuracy and efficiency at the cost of higher memory usage. The methodology and results are reproducible, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

*Chenyang Li,Himanshu Sharma,Youcai Wu,Joseph Magallanes,K. T. Ramesh,Michael D. Shields*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed surrogate model that replaces the KCC model's empirical failure surfaces with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression to improve generalization, accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for constitutive behavior of concrete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in widely used concrete models like KCC by improving flexibility, uncertainty quantification, and prediction accuracy, especially in diverse confinement scenarios.

Method: The method integrates a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with derivative-based physical constraints for learning failure surfaces using experimental triaxial compression data, evaluating generalization on unseen conditions.

Result: The physics-informed constrained GPR outperformed unconstrained versions in extrapolation and predicted more reliably in high-confinement scenarios, with reduced predictive variance and tighter confidence intervals.

Conclusion: This framework improves calibration, generalization, and reliability of constitutive concrete models while preserving interpretability and modular structure, offering practical advancements for civil and defense applications.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Projected Quantum Kernels (PQK) to enhance CNN performance on small datasets, achieving notable accuracy improvements on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs struggle with limited labeled data, which restricts their representation ability. There is a need for techniques to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors incorporated Projected Quantum Kernels (PQK), rooted in quantum computing principles, into CNNs for feature extraction to enhance their capabilities for small datasets.

Result: The PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on MNIST and 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 1000 samples, outperforming classical CNNs (60% and 12%, respectively).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of PQK to improve CNNs for small datasets, highlighting quantum computing's role in addressing data scarcity issues in machine learning.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weather-aware deep learning framework for real-time drone route prediction, outperforming traditional algorithms in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path-planning algorithms, though optimal, are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time adjustments in dynamic or adverse weather conditions.

Method: Synthetic data from classical path-planning simulations is used to train transformer-based and attention-based deep learning models. These models incorporate weather heuristics and attention mechanisms to improve real-time routing decisions in dynamic environments.

Result: Experimental findings show that weather-aware deep learning models provide significant computational speedup while maintaining optimization performance, with transformers excelling in dynamic weather adaptation.

Conclusion: This framework improves efficiency and safety in Drone-as-a-Service operations, showcasing real-time weather-responsive route optimization at scale.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

*Yi Gu,Lingyou Pang,Xiangkun Ye,Tianyu Wang,Jianyu Lin,Carey E. Priebe,Alexander Aue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIGMA, a framework to benchmark model collapse in LLMs using spectral analysis of the Gram matrix, providing scalable and mathematically grounded monitoring tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increased use of synthetic data in training LLMs has led to the issue of 'model collapse,' where recursive training degrades distributional and representational quality. Current methods lack rigorous frameworks to quantify and predict this phenomenon in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The authors propose SIGMA, a framework that tracks model collapse using spectral analysis of the embedding Gram matrix. It provides deterministic and stochastic bounds on the spectrum, with a scalable stochastic formulation for large-scale models.

Result: SIGMA effectively benchmarks the onset of degeneration in LLMs by detecting transitions to collapsed states, offering theoretical and practical insights.

Conclusion: SIGMA is a scalable and theoretically grounded tool that aids in monitoring and mitigating model collapse in LLM training pipelines, ensuring data quality and model efficacy.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

TL;DR: PanSubNet is a deep learning model enabling cost-effective molecular subtyping of PDAC from standard histology slides, showing high accuracy and robust validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The molecular subtyping of PDAC has significant clinical value, but its application is limited by traditional methods' high cost, time consumption, and tissue requirements.

Method: A deep learning framework, PanSubNet, was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two cohorts, leveraging histology and RNA-seq data with dual-scale architecture and attention mechanisms for transparent learning and predictions.

Result: PanSubNet achieved high accuracy (mean AUC 88.5% internally, 84.0% externally), improved prognostic stratification over RNA-seq labels, and demonstrated alignment with known molecular markers.

Conclusion: PanSubNet enables rapid and interpretable molecular subtyping of PDAC, advancing precision oncology and integration into digital pathology workflows.

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

*Yigal Koifman,Eran Iceland,Erez Koifman,Ariel Barel,Alfred M. Bruckstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an image-based reinforcement learning method for multi-agent swarm tasks, overcoming limitations of traditional methods. It evaluates the approach on a multi-agent convergence task with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods struggle with scalability and efficiency due to reliance on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations.

Method: The authors propose encoding agent observations as structured visual inputs, processed by Neural Networks to extract spatial features and generate decentralized control rules.

Result: Their method outperforms an analytical benchmark in convergence speed and rivals an advanced framework, VariAntNet, achieving higher success rates in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Image-based reinforcement learning shows high potential for decentralized swarm control, providing an effective and practical alternative in scenarios where other methods fall short.

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

*Zhakshylyk Nurlanov,Frank R. Schmidt,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAILS is a framework for evaluating LLM robustness by utilizing token-level iterative optimization without gradients or priors, achieving high success in both open-source models and closed-source systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for rigorous robustness evaluation of LLMs against adversarial jailbreak attacks in safety-critical domains, overcoming the limitations of current automated attack methods.

Method: RAILS employs a framework based on token-level iterative optimization leveraging model logits, featuring an auto-regressive loss for prefix matching and history-based selection for improved attack success rates.

Result: RAILS achieves near-perfect success rates in attacking open-source models and high transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

Conclusion: RAILS eliminates dependency on gradients, enabling effective cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks and improving adversarial robustness evaluation for LLMs across diverse systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

### [237] [Spectral Archaeology: The Causal Topology of Model Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03424)
*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra to analyze behavior in language models across layers and languages. It identifies processing strategies, training discontinuities, and offers solutions for performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to go beyond behavioral benchmarks to understand the underlying mechanisms of language models, particularly to detect and analyze discontinuities unrecognized by conventional evaluation methods.

Method: Attention-graph spectra are calculated for each model layer to create 'spectral fingerprints,' using measures like algebraic connectivity, smoothness, and spectral entropy.

Result: Four key results are presented: (1) The discovery of 'Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse' (PTCC), (2) its trade-off with specialization and flexibility, (3) identification of consistent processing strategies across models, and (4) localization of PTCC to specific network layers with partial restoration using activation steering.

Conclusion: Attention-graph spectra are effective for auditing model behaviors, verifying their training regimes, and identifying issues such as connectivity failures in language models.

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

*Yan Wang,Yitao Xu,Nanhan Shen,Jinyan Su,Jimin Huang,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve domain specialization via sparse routing and introduces "COMMITTEEAUDIT," which reveals that most routing is dominated by a small group of experts, limiting true specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether Mixture of Experts models truly achieve domain specialization or if structural biases dominate their routing behavior.

Method: Introduced COMMITTEEAUDIT, a framework analyzing routing behavior, and applied it to models and the MMLU benchmark to identify patterns in expert utilization across domains.

Result: Identified a static coalition of experts, termed the Standing Committee, that centralizes the majority of routing, contradicting assumptions of pervasive specialization.

Conclusion: Specialization in MoE models is limited by structural biases, and current training objectives may hinder natural optimization paths, reducing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VNU-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multi-source, cross-video understanding in news videos, addressing gaps in real-world news comprehension that involves multimodal and multi-perspective analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-source intra-video reasoning, but real-world news understanding inherently involves multi-source perspectives with complementary details, conflicting claims, and evolving narratives.

Method: The paper proposes VNU-Bench with unique question types for evaluating multi-source multimodal news understanding, using a hybrid human-model question generation process for scalability and quality control. The dataset includes 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 questions.

Result: Evaluation of various multimodal language models (MLLMs) reveals significant challenges posed by the dataset, highlighting the complexity of multi-source news video understanding.

Conclusion: The VNU-Bench benchmark addresses limitations in current MLLM evaluation and offers an essential tool for advancing robust multi-source reasoning in the news domain.

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of imputing systematically missing target variables in shifted domains, leveraging known causal relationships from source-domain data.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates geometric convergence and better target-imputation accuracy on synthetic and real datasets compared to existing baselines, especially under strong domain shifts.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a scalable approach to handle missing target variable imputations in shifted domains using causal DAGs, proving effective in both theoretical guarantees and practical applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis using machine learning for enhanced accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving road safety by addressing limitations of feature optimization in existing machine learning and deep learning techniques for analyzing driver behaviors.

Method: Preprocessing (label encoding, scaling, oversampling), testing 13 machine learning algorithms, and deploying Random Forest Classifier coupled with interpretability tools like LIME.

Result: Random Forest Classifier achieved 95% accuracy initially and 94.2% after feature optimization without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: The hybrid model balances predictive performance and interpretability, supporting safer and more efficient driver behavior analysis systems.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenges of deploying large models like LLMs on hardware with resource constraints while maintaining accuracy, and to make the quantization and deployment process easier for non-expert users.

Method: The proposed solution, HAQA, automates quantization and deployment processes by leveraging LLMs to handle hyperparameter tuning and hardware configurations efficiently. It applies adaptive quantization strategies to optimize model performance across various hardware.

Conclusion: HAQA simplifies and optimizes the quantization and deployment of models for users with diverse expertise levels, effectively enhancing adaptability to various hardware requirements and releasing its code for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeRPO, a framework for code generation reinforcement learning that develops robust, dense rewards grounded in verifiable feedback, offering significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of sparse or misaligned rewards in reinforcement learning for code generation, which limits the potential for functional correctness and computational efficiency.

Method: VeRPO creates dense rewards by dynamically weighting and summing partial successes from unit tests during training. It integrates this with global execution outcomes for consistent, robust rewards without external reward models.

Result: The VeRPO framework outperforms baseline methods, improving pass@1 by 8.83%, while maintaining minimal time cost (less than 0.02%) and no added GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: VeRPO is a significant advancement for RL-based code generation, offering an efficient and effective reward design framework grounded in verifiable execution feedback.

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO), a framework that combines three spherical operator solutions for adapting to heterogeneous systems while retaining spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spherical deep learning methods struggle to balance geometric inductive biases and the ability to model real-world heterogeneity.

Method: The authors propose a Designable Green's Function Framework (DGF) to create systematic Green's functions under rotational groups and develop GSNO, which integrates three solutions: Equivariant, Invariant, and Anisotropic.

Result: Evaluations on various tasks such as spherical MNIST, cortical parcellation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, and molecule structure modeling validated the superior performance of GSNO.

Conclusion: GSNO successfully models heterogeneous systems, addressing nuisance variability and anisotropy while maintaining spherical geometry and efficiency.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on overcoming challenges in multisensor data for predicting glycemic events in diabetes patients, with emphasis on imputation techniques to manage signal noise and missing values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance health management of chronic diseases like diabetes by overcoming limitations in continuous monitoring data, especially for hypoglycemia prediction.

Method: Comprehensive analysis and evaluation of machine learning and deep learning-based imputation techniques tailored to healthcare data.

Result: Developed a systematic paradigm for tailored feature-specific imputation strategies to address heterogeneous data patterns and temporal gaps.

Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of exploring temporal dynamics and employing multiple imputation techniques to effectively handle varying temporal patterns in sensor data for improved glycemic event prediction.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

*Yuansan Liu,Antoinette Tordesillas,James Bailey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called spatiotemporal LID (stLID) to enhance landslide failure detection by integrating spatial and temporal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of existing methods in capturing spatial correlations and temporal dynamics in landslide monitoring data.

Method: The authors propose three main extensions to the LID-based sLID technique: kinematic enhancement, spatial fusion using Bayesian estimation, and temporal modeling with tLID, culminating in the unified stLID framework.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that stLID provides superior precision and earlier detection of landslide failures compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating both spatial and temporal information in improving landslide failure detection.

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

TL;DR: The paper builds the first cohesive theoretical framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, explaining and optimizing key mechanisms while addressing NP-hard routing challenges and proposing orthogonality regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a theoretical foundation for the key mechanisms in Mixture-of-Experts models, enabling a better understanding and optimization of their performance.

Method: The authors developed a unified framework from Bayesian and information-theoretic perspectives, theoretically proving the limitations of current routing methods and proposing orthogonality regularization as the optimal relaxation method.

Result: They established the NP-hardness of optimal routing, identified the "Coherence Barrier," and proved that orthogonality regularization can bridge the gap between the hard global optimum and practical greedy strategies.

Conclusion: The research offers theoretical validation and a robust basis for optimizing and innovating Mixture-of-Experts models, enhancing their design and effectiveness for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALERT, a framework for zero-shot jailbreak detection in large language models, addressing real-world challenges and achieving high detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to evolving jailbreak attacks, and current detection methods fail under zero-shot settings where no attack templates are available during training.

Method: ALERT uses amplification frameworks, analyzing internal features layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise to identify safety-relevant signals, coupled with dual classifiers for detection.

Result: ALERT demonstrates strong zero-shot detection across safety benchmarks, ranking among top methods and exceeding baseline performance by 10%-40% in accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion: ALERT provides an effective solution for detecting jailbreak attacks without prior knowledge, enhancing security for LLMs.

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

TL;DR: This study evaluates and benchmarks ML, DL, and LLM models for forecasting mental health using behavioral data. DL models, especially Transformers, outperform others, while personalization improves severe state predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop proactive mental health forecasting methods for early interventions, leveraging smartphone sensing technology and addressing gaps in prior reactive studies.

Method: Uses the CES dataset to systematically compare ML, DL, and LLM approaches across multiple evaluation dimensions, such as temporal analysis, feature granularity, personalization, and class imbalance handling.

Result: DL models excel in performance, particularly with Transformer's Macro-F1 score of 0.58. LLMs handle contextual reasoning well but struggle with temporal modeling. Personalization notably enhances severe mental health state predictions.

Conclusion: DL and personalized strategies are effective for mental health forecasting. This research highlights the potential for adaptive, human-centered technologies to improve mental health support.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of LMs in problem-solving tasks, especially when computational budgets are constrained, by leveraging efficient search heuristics within a structured framework.

Method: The paper introduces Levin Tree Search (LTS) adapted to the Tree-of-Thoughts framework, using LM probabilities as heuristics to reduce thought evaluations and ensure efficient exploration.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that LTS within the ToT framework achieves higher or comparable accuracy than baseline search algorithms across different domains and LMs, while adhering to limited computational budgets.

Conclusion: LTS within the ToT framework is effective for cost-efficient and time-sensitive problem solving, proving suitable for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops methods to address systematic bias in simulator outputs for routing decisions in networks, using real-world observations and synthetic samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulator outputs for routing often have systematic bias, and real-world measurements are costly and scarce. The need arises for methods to accurately estimate biases and improve decisions.

Method: The paper uses Laplacian-regularized least squares to model edge-specific biases via a similarity graph, providing calibrated edge cost estimates. It also proposes active learning for cold-start scenarios.

Result: It offers finite-sample error bounds, suboptimality guarantees for routes, and a data-driven certificate for near-optimality verification. Its methods are validated through numerical experiments on real networks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines synthetic and real data to address simulator biases, improving routing decisions and offering scalable solutions even in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Motivation: To extend neural network operators to random dynamics by incorporating probabilistic structures into stochastic neurons for better modeling of stochastic signals.

Method: Develop a new class of operators where randomness is introduced at the neuron level via stochastic integrators, analyze mean-square convergence, and perform numerical simulations to validate the framework.

Result: Demonstrated accurate sample path reconstructions, fast mean square error decay, and effective graphical results showcasing robustness and precision.

Conclusion: K-SNNOs successfully approximate stochastic signals with reliability, showcasing theoretical and numerical effectiveness for stochastic process modeling.

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

Conclusion: ReLA enables robust decision-making and efficient job scheduling, confirming its efficacy for real-world manufacturing applications, particularly with complex and large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

### [257] [In Search of Grandmother Cells: Tracing Interpretable Neurons in Tabular Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03657)
*Ricardo Knauer,Erik Rodner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates if neurons in foundation models function like 'grandmother cells', focusing on their inherent interpretability by analyzing the concepts individual neurons respond to.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if interpretable neurons, akin to 'grandmother cells', emerge naturally in foundation models, fostering understanding of their decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces two information-theoretic metrics to measure neuronal saliency and selectivity for concepts and applies these to analyze TabPFN's neuronal representations through a neuron-concept pair search.

Result: Evidence shows that some neurons in TabPFN display statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts, indicating moderate interpretability.

Conclusion: Interpretable neurons can naturally emerge in foundation models, and their identification is feasible without needing complex interpretability methods.

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

*Basile Tousside,Janis Mohr,Jörg Frochte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GESCL, a method to tackle catastrophic forgetting in CNNs for continual learning using group and exclusive sparsity regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting in CNNs during sequential learning of multiple tasks by balancing network stability and plasticity.

Method: The method uses stability regularization to preserve filters important for past tasks and plasticity regularization to efficiently sparsify the network and adapt unimportant filters for new tasks.

Result: GESCL improves overall continual learning performance, classification accuracy, and minimizes catastrophic forgetting compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GESCL efficiently balances stability and plasticity in CNNs, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and using fewer parameters and resources compared to other continual learning approaches.

Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

*Amir Hossein Yari,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO optimization for LLMs encounters structural issues in reasoning tasks, which AMIR-GRPO addresses using contrastive regularizers to enhance supervision efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in GRPO when applied to complex reasoning tasks by optimizing supervision quality from rollouts.

Method: Introduce AMIR-GRPO with a contrastive regularizer utilizing intra-group reward rankings to address GRPO's biases and improve output quality.

Result: AMIR-GRPO outperformed GRPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with better reasoning chain separation and broader task coverage.

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO improves large language model training in reasoning-heavy tasks by leveraging rich rollouts more effectively compared to standard GRPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

### [260] [Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03664)
*Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVEAD, a novel anomaly detection method that excels in identifying local anomalies within data of varying densities using stochastic Voronoi ensembles. It achieves linear time and constant space complexities, outperforming 12 state-of-the-art techniques on 45 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods struggle with datasets of varying local densities, often missing local anomalies or requiring complex parameter tuning with high computational costs.

Method: SVEAD uses stochastic Voronoi diagrams to decompose data space, analyzing restricted regions independently. Anomalies are scored based on normalized relative distances with local scaling. It operates with linear time and constant space complexity.

Result: Experiments conducted on 45 datasets show SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: SVEAD provides a highly efficient and effective solution for detecting anomalies in complex datasets, offering practical advantages in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

*Ibai Ramirez,Jokin Alcibar,Joel Pino,Mikel Sanz,Jose I. Aizpurua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that integrates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty for better insulation material aging prediction in transformers, assessing its advantages over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PINN-based methods for prognostics are mostly deterministic, lacking effective uncertainty quantification (UQ), which is essential for risk-aware decision-making in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM).

Method: The study develops a heteroscedastic B-PINN framework combining Bayesian Neural Networks, physics-based constraints, and prior distributions to yield probabilistic predictive posteriors.

Result: The proposed B-PINN outperforms deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs, and other Bayesian variants in predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. It has been validated using a transformer insulation aging scenario with data from a solar power plant.

Conclusion: The B-PINN framework showcases the potential of Bayesian physics-informed approaches for improved uncertainty quantification and decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

TL;DR: A novel reaction descriptor, RXNEmb, is introduced for improved reaction prediction and classification, enabling reaction space visualization and mechanistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective reaction descriptors that bridge real-world chemistry with digital models are scarce in reaction prediction, prompting the introduction of RXNEmb.

Method: RXNEmb was developed using a pre-trained RXNGraphormer model to distinguish real from erroneous reactions, focusing on bond formation/cleavage patterns.

Result: RXNEmb successfully re-clustered the USPTO-50k dataset based on bond-change similarities, allowing visualization of reaction diversity and mechanistic insights from attention weight analysis.

Conclusion: RXNEmb is a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction analysis, supporting data-centric approaches in reaction discovery.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores privacy risks in graph generative diffusion models through black-box inference attacks and proposes defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph generative diffusion models are powerful tools for generating graphs, but potential privacy risks in these models have not been well studied.

Method: The authors design three types of black-box inference attacks (graph reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference) and evaluate them through extensive experiments on different models and real-world data.

Result: The proposed attacks outperform baseline methods, showing their effectiveness, while two defense mechanisms are also introduced to mitigate the attacks and maintain model utility.

Conclusion: Graph generative diffusion models are susceptible to privacy risks, but these risks can be mitigated through carefully designed defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

### [264] [TreeAdv: Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03703)
*Lang Cao,Hui Ruan,Yongqian Li,Peng Chao,Wu Ning,Haonan Song,Renhong Chen,Yitong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeAdv improves reinforcement learning for large language models by addressing inefficiencies in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding better performance on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sample efficiency and avoid verbose, redundant outputs in reinforcement learning for language models, especially for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors introduce TreeAdv, which explicitly incorporates tree structures in group rollouts, redistributes token-level advantages, and allows entropy-based branching, improving exploration and advantage assignment in frameworks like GRPO.

Result: TreeAdv consistently outperformed baseline methods like GRPO and GSPO across 10 math reasoning benchmarks while using fewer resources.

Conclusion: TreeAdv offers a more efficient and effective framework for reinforcement learning in language models, leading to improved reasoning abilities with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

### [265] [Investigating Knowledge Distillation Through Neural Networks for Protein Binding Affinity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03704)
*Wajid Arshad Abbasi,Syed Ali Abbas,Maryum Bibi,Saiqa Andleeb,Muhammad Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a knowledge distillation framework to enhance protein binding affinity prediction using structure-based knowledge during training, while relying only on sequence data during inference. The method improves sequence-based prediction by transferring structural insights and reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in achieving high predictive accuracy for protein binding affinity due to limited availability of experimentally resolved protein structures motivates the study. Existing structure-based models generally outperform sequence-based methods, creating a need for innovative strategies to bridge this gap.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes knowledge distillation, where a structure-informed teacher network guides a sequence-based student network. Using binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations, the student model learns from structural knowledge during training but relies solely on sequence data during inference. LOCO cross-validation was utilized for evaluation.

Result: The distillation-based sequence-only model achieved better performance metrics (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.481 and RMSE: 2.488 kcal/mol) compared to the sequence-only baseline (P_r: 0.375, RMSE: 2.712 kcal/mol), showing reduced bias and improved agreement. It approached the accuracy of structure-based models (P_r: 0.512, RMSE: 2.445 kcal/mol).

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation effectively transfers structural insights to sequence-based protein binding affinity predictors, improving accuracy and reducing bias. This approach has the potential to bridge performance gaps as more data becomes available, offering a scalable solution for prediction tasks and practical application in protein science.

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a geometric interpretation of the Pivoted Cholesky decomposition in kernel methods, linking it to Farthest Point Sampling and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, with a concise derivation and Python implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clearer understanding and geometric intuition of Pivoted Cholesky decomposition, which is widely used for scaling Gaussian Processes with large datasets in kernel methods.

Method: Elucidating the algorithm within RKHS, showing its equivalence to Farthest Point Sampling with the kernel metric, and its connection to implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

Result: The paper presents a geometric interpretation linking pivotal selection to specific sampling and orthogonalization processes, alongside a Python implementation to support practical use.

Conclusion: The geometric understanding of Pivoted Cholesky decomposition bridges theoretical concepts with practical applications in kernel methods.

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R3L is a reinforcement learning framework addressing the issues of exploration and exploitation in language models through reflect-then-retry synthesis, pivotal credit assignment, and positive amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning approaches for LLMs struggle with exploration (low success rates, high costs) and exploitation (unstable training, coarse rewards).

Method: R3L proposes reflect-then-retry for targeted exploration, pivotal credit for focused updates, and positive amplification to prioritize successful outcomes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate 5% to 52% improvements over baselines in agentic and reasoning tasks with stable training.

Conclusion: R3L effectively enhances both exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning for LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Elastic Trust Regions (ETR), a dynamic mechanism to improve Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by addressing limitations in GRPO algorithm regarding trust region constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural limitation of GRPO in RLVR, which imposes static trust region constraints that fail to account for heterogeneous signal quality, leading to inefficient learning outcomes.

Method: Proposed Elastic Trust Regions (ETR) with dual-level elasticity. At the micro level, ETR scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude. At the macro level, ETR adjusts update budgets using group variance to optimize learning zones.

Result: ETR consistently outperformed GRPO in experiments using AIME and MATH benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy and maintaining exploration via controlled policy entropy.

Conclusion: ETR improves RLVR by dynamically adapting optimization constraints to signal quality, ensuring better performance and sustained exploration compared to GRPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EDCO, a dynamic curriculum learning framework for fine-tuning domain-specific large language models using inference entropy to prioritize training samples effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods lack adaptability and often use static curricula that do not evolve to meet the model's changing needs during training.

Method: EDCO employs inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration, combining an efficient estimator, entropy-based sample selection, and optimized LLM training.

Result: EDCO improves performance in communication, medicine, and law domains on Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models while reducing computational costs by 83.5%.

Conclusion: Dynamic curriculum learning using inference entropy improves the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning domain-specific large language models compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

*Paulius Rauba,Viktor Cikojevic,Fran Bartolic,Sam Levang,Ty Dickinson,Chase Dwelle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM-2, a fast and lightweight probabilistic transformer model that improves weather forecasting accuracy, especially for decision-relevant variables, with faster training speeds compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weather forecasts influence critical decision-making in various industries, and users often need derived variables rather than basic atmospheric data. Current models are not optimized to directly provide distributions over these derived variables, resulting in inefficiencies and biases.

Method: The authors propose GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer trained on the CRPS objective to learn global atmospheric dynamics and decision-related variables directly. It achieves faster training speeds and higher efficiency compared to traditional numerical weather prediction models and other machine learning approaches.

Result: GEM-2 outperforms existing numerical weather prediction models, demonstrates competitive results against advanced ML models, provides state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, and shows robust performance across different architectural and training choices.

Conclusion: GEM-2 represents a significant improvement in weather forecasting for decision-relevant metrics, combining computational efficiency with high accuracy, and effectively addressing biases and inefficiencies found in traditional approaches.

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

*Sebastian Müller,Tobias Schneider,Ruben Kemna,Vanessa Toborek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFIRE, an algorithm for generating surrogate rule-based explanations for tabular data models, is improved by a post-hoc pruning strategy to reduce ambiguity and enhance interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for transparent explanations in sensitive domains where tabular data models are employed.

Method: A post-hoc pruning strategy was proposed to remove low-contributing or conflicting rules from CFIRE's surrogate rule models to reduce ambiguity while maintaining model fidelity.

Result: The proposed pruning strategy resulted in smaller, less ambiguous models with minimal loss in predictive performance, as validated through experiments on various datasets.

Conclusion: Enhanced model interpretability and reduced ambiguity were achieved in CFIRE, aligning with the demand for explanations in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

Motivation: Address the challenge of zero-shot node classification in TAGs where labeled data is absent, with applications in various fields like social networks and e-commerce.

Method: Develop the ZPT framework, which integrates a pre-trained graph-language model, a conditional generative model for synthetic data generation, and continuous prompt tuning for classification.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that ZPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of the bimodal generator.

Conclusion: ZPT successfully improves zero-shot node classification in TAGs, leveraging bimodal generation and prompt tuning to achieve superior performance.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

*Rehan Ahmad,Muhammad Kashif,Nouhaila Innan,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reproducible framework for benchmarking quantum machine learning (QML) models against classical counterparts across financial tasks, showing quantum advantages under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fairly assess and identify scenarios where current-generation quantum machine learning models outperform classical methods in financial tasks.

Method: They benchmarked QML and classical models across three tasks: return prediction, live trading simulation, and volatility forecasting, using standardized data splits, features, and evaluation metrics.

Result: QML achieved higher performance in certain conditions, including higher AUC and accuracy in directional classification, better risk-adjusted returns in live trading, and competitive volatility forecasting metrics.

Conclusion: Their framework highlights cases where QML models excel and demonstrates that QML performance benefits greatly from alignment with data structure and circuit design.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.

### [274] [Detecting Semantic Backdoors in a Mystery Shopping Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03805)
*Arpad Berta,Gabor Danner,Istvan Hegedus,Mark Jelasity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of detecting semantic backdoors in classification models, proposing a method based on model distance calibration, adversarial training, and model inversion techniques to distinguish clean models from poisoned ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic backdoors in classification models are harder to detect than conventional backdoors with trigger patterns, posing risks to machine learning systems. The motivation stems from ensuring consumer protection through methods to detect backdoors in models built by service providers.

Method: The method involves training clean and poisoned reference models via trusted infrastructure, calibrating a distance threshold for model identification, and requesting adversarial training from providers. Model distances are measured using samples that maximize deviation from clean data.

Result: The proposed approach reliably separates clean models from poisoned ones and shows superior effectiveness compared to existing backdoor detection methods. It remains effective even against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: The technique proves to be a powerful way to detect semantic backdoors, offering better detection rates and reliability, ensuring machine learning systems' integrity.

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes LTN-GAN, a framework combining GANs and LTNs to improve logical consistency and diversity in data generation, outperforming traditional GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of mechanisms in GANs for incorporating domain-specific prior knowledge or enforcing logical consistency, which limits their application in rule-intensive domains.

Method: The paper combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), integrating first-order logic with neural networks to enforce logical constraints during the generative process.

Result: The proposed LTN-GAN model was evaluated on synthetic datasets and MNIST, showing significant improvement over traditional GANs in adhering to logical constraints while maintaining data quality and diversity.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of integrating neuro-symbolic approaches like LTNs with GANs for advanced generative tasks, especially in areas requiring knowledge-intensive logical adherence.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FALCON, a framework designed to enhance one-shot federated learning for non-IID image data, achieving a 9.58% improvement in average accuracy compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-shot federated learning methods struggle with robust performance in real-world domains and efficiency with non-IID data, especially in scenarios like medical imaging.

Method: FALCON employs feature-aware hierarchical token sequences, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator, and knowledge distillation to improve the performance of OSFL on non-IID image datasets.

Result: FALCON outperformed state-of-the-art OSFL baselines by achieving a 9.58% increase in average accuracy on both medical and natural image datasets.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively addresses non-IID challenges in OSFL, demonstrating superior results in diverse datasets and proving its applicability for real-world domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

TL;DR: SR-MoE addresses the expert collapse issue in Mixture of Experts architectures by introducing spectral constraints and dual regularization to improve model scalability and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures suffer from expert collapse, limiting scalability and adaptability. Resolving this issue ensures stable lifelong learning in neural networks.

Method: The proposed SR-MoE method employs spectral norm constraints for Lipschitz continuity and stable rank penalties to maintain diversity in expert selection, ensuring modularity in routing.

Result: SR-MoE outperforms traditional linear gating, maintaining structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%) while avoiding accuracy drops (up to 4.72%) in modular one-shot adaptation tasks.

Conclusion: SR-MoE demonstrates a scalable and modular solution for high-capacity networks, enabling stable, localized updates and improving lifelong learning capabilities.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), a refinement of GRPO showing superior results in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve GRPO's flexibility and generalization, specifically its clipping mechanism for better reinforcement learning involving large language models.

Method: Introduce adaptive boundary clipping to the GRPO framework, making it asymmetric and adaptive for enhanced performance.

Result: ABC-GRPO outperforms GRPO in Qwen3 LLM mathematical reasoning tasks, with higher entropy and better exploration throughout training.

Conclusion: ABC-GRPO represents a notable improvement to GRPO, aiding both task performance and maintenance of exploration capabilities during training.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

*Yujie Feng,Hao Wang,Jian Li,Xu Chu,Zhaolu Kang,Yiran Liu,Yasha Wang,Philip S. Yu,Xiao-Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new continual learning framework, FOREVER, inspired by the human forgetting curve, for large language models to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current memory replay methods in continual learning for large language models, which rely on rigid step-based heuristics that do not align with a model's learning progress.

Method: Introduces FOREVER, a forgetting curve-based memory replay framework, which aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time defined by optimizer update magnitudes and adapts replay intensity using a novel regularization mechanism.

Result: FOREVER demonstrated its effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting through extensive experiments on three continual learning benchmarks and models with sizes from 0.6B to 13B parameters.

Conclusion: Aligning memory replay schedules to a model-based timeline inspired by forgetting curves offers a better approach to mitigating catastrophic forgetting in large language models.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: The study focuses on creating explainable machine learning models to predict stage-specific cancer survival rates for colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers using the SEER dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overestimation of performance and lack of transparency in traditional survival models that combine all cancer stages.

Method: Used explainable ML techniques like SHAP and LIME to analyze feature-stage interactions in cancer survivability for specific types and stages of cancer.

Result: Identified how demographic and clinical factors influence survival differently across cancer stages and types, providing clinical insights.

Conclusion: The study enhances transparency, supports personalized treatment planning, and sheds light on the important factors affecting survival at each cancer stage.

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of transparency in black-box models commonly used in news recommendation systems and enable editors to better align with audience behavior.

Method: It uses fuzzy neural networks to derive configurable and interpretable rules from behavioral data, balancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Result: The system outperforms established baselines in predicting click behavior, extracts meaningful consumption patterns, and demonstrates practical applicability on datasets MIND and EB-NeRD.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise in balancing accuracy and interpretability in news recommendation while offering insights into audience behavior for editorial improvement.

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

TL;DR: The paper extends symbolic regression to include multiple categorical variables with different levels of parameter sharing, reducing parameter requirements and yielding additional insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how symbolic regression can be improved for datasets with multiple categorical variables, reducing complexity and enhancing interpretability.

Method: Introduced intermediate levels of parameter sharing for multiple categorical variables, tested on synthetic data, and validated with an astrophysics dataset.

Result: Achieved similar fit quality with fewer parameters and extra insights using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The novel method improves symbolic regression by reducing parameters, enhancing performance, and extracting more information from data.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel autoregressive diffusion framework for designing mechanical linkages. It addresses challenges in nonlinear kinematic constraints and large design spaces by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the complexity in designing mechanical linkages due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete configurations, and nonlinear constraints, which renders traditional methods computationally intractable.

Method: The method employs an autoregressive diffusion framework combining a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). This approach encodes target trajectories and incrementally generates graph-based mechanisms in adaptive, trial-and-error synthesis to address problems like kinematic locking.

Result: The study demonstrates the successful synthesis of linkage systems with up to 20 nodes and scalable generalization to arbitrary node counts, outperforming traditional optimization techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach establishes a new paradigm for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems, advancing graph-based methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis.

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances sleep stage classification reliability, overcoming data variability and sample size limitations, showcasing radar technology’s potential for unobtrusive sleep monitoring.

Abstract: Objective: Ultra-wideband radar technology offers a promising solution for unobtrusive and cost-effective in-home sleep monitoring. However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying nonlinear trajectory data by connecting observations to their underlying dynamic systems.

Method: Developing Dynafit, which approximates the Koopman operator for linearizing dynamics in feature space using a kernel trick and tailored functions.

Result: Demonstrated Dynafit’s effectiveness on tasks like chaos detection, handwritten dynamics recognition, and visual dynamic texture classification.

Conclusion: Dynafit provides an effective dynamic-based classification method that can incorporate prior knowledge and handle nonlinear systems.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning of TFMs struggles with accurate generalization performance prediction due to limited validation data under data-scarce conditions.

Method: CausalMixFT uses Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to generate causally-informed synthetic samples for data augmentation, ensuring feature dependence consistency while improving data diversity.

Result: Across 33 datasets and over 2300 runs, CausalMixFT improved median normalized ROC-AUC to 0.12 (versus 0.10 standard fine-tuning) and reduced validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30.

Conclusion: Incorporating causal structures for data augmentation via CausalMixFT is effective and reliable for overcoming challenges of fine-tuning tabular models under low-data conditions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated learning approach for white blood cell morphology analysis that overcomes privacy and dataset variability issues in low- and middle-income countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust and generalizable automated blood morphology analysis in resource-limited healthcare environments, but data privacy regulations and dataset variability pose significant challenges.

Method: The authors developed and applied a federated learning framework that enables model training across clinical institutions without sharing sensitive training data.

Result: Federated models exhibited better cross-site performance and generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized models, demonstrating improved robustness and domain invariance.

Conclusion: Federated learning is a promising solution for equitable and scalable medical AI development in settings with strict privacy requirements and diverse data environments.

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

### [288] [Clinical Data Goes MEDS? Let's OWL make sense of it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04164)
*Alberto Marfoglia,Jong Ho Jhee,Adrien Coulet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEDS-OWL is introduced as an OWL ontology to enhance semantic integration of MEDS-based healthcare datasets into the Semantic Web ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning applications in healthcare are impeded by non-standardized healthcare data, limiting interoperability and reproducibility.

Method: MEDS-OWL ontology provides formal semantic concepts with RDF representation for MEDS data. A Python tool, meds2rdf, converts MEDS events into RDF graphs, validated by SHACL constraints.

Result: MEDS-OWL includes 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, clinical data becomes FAIR-aligned and interoperable.

Conclusion: The study bridges MEDS with the Semantic Web, offering a semantic layer for clinical data and enabling graph-based analytics.

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

### [289] [Agentic Rubrics as Contextual Verifiers for SWE Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04171)
*Mohit Raghavendra,Anisha Gunjal,Bing Liu,Yunzhong He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Rubrics, a scalable alternative to code execution for verification in software engineering agents, achieving significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is pivotal for reinforcement learning and inference gains, but existing methods relying on code execution face scalability challenges due to environment setups.

Method: The paper proposes Agentic Rubrics, where an expert agent builds a rubric checklist from interaction with the codebase, and patches are scored via this context-grounded rubric without test execution.

Result: On SWE-Bench Verified with Test-Time Scaling, Agentic Rubrics show significant performance improvements, achieving 54.2% and 40.6% scores on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and Qwen3-32B respectively, outperforming baselines by at least +3.5%.

Conclusion: Agentic Rubrics offer an effective, scalable, and granular verification method, flagging issues tests may not and relying on context-grounded criteria essential for SWE agents.

Abstract: Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.

### [290] [Robust Physics Discovery from Highly Corrupted Data: A PINN Framework Applied to the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04176)
*Pietro de Oliveira Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to recover physical parameters of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under high noise conditions with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of extracting physical parameters from noisy, sparse data in spatiotemporal dynamics, where traditional methods fail due to noise amplification.

Method: A PINN integrated with automatic differentiation is employed to achieve accurate reconstruction of physical parameters (e.g., beta) from noisy data, with robust generalization across different regimes and minimal computational requirements.

Result: The framework achieves sub-1 percent error rates in parameter recovery, even under extreme noise conditions (20% additive Gaussian noise), and provides consistent performance across various scenarios, validating its robustness and practical utility.

Conclusion: Physics-Informed Neural Networks provide an effective alternative to traditional methods for inverse problems in noisy, sparse data contexts, with physics-based regularization acting as a robust filter against measurement uncertainty.

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.

*Nia Touko,Matthew O A Ellis,Cristiano Capone,Alessio Burrello,Elisa Donati,Luca Manneschi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues with signal drift in long-term EMG decoding and proposes a lightweight Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework using novel strategies to enhance inter-session accuracy without relying on large datasets or high-compute methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to overcome challenges such as signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes that hinder the reliable long-term performance of surface EMG decoding.

Method: The proposed method uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone and introduces three strategies for test-time adaptation: causal adaptive batch normalization, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay, and meta-learning for few-shot calibration.

Result: Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 dataset, the framework reduces inter-session accuracy gaps effectively. Experience-replay updates demonstrate stability with limited data, and meta-learning achieves high performance even in few-shot regimes, outperforming existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work provides a pathway toward robust and energy-efficient long-term EMG decoding systems suitable for wearables and prosthetic applications.

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

### [293] [Quantifying the Impact of Modules and Their Interactions in the PSO-X Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04100)
*Christian L. Camacho-Villalón,Ana Nikolikj,Katharina Dost,Eva Tuba,Sašo Džeroski,Tome Eftimov*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study uses the PSO-X framework to evaluate 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms, examining the influence of framework modules on optimization performance across benchmark scenarios using functional ANOVA and cluster analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of empirical studies on which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks, specifically for particle swarm optimization, and how these modules interact in solving different classes of optimization problems.

Method: 1424 PSO algorithms derived from the PSO-X framework were evaluated on 25 benchmark functions with two dimensional configurations (10D, 30D). Functional ANOVA quantified the performance impact of various modules and module interactions. Cluster analysis was applied to group problem classes with similar module-effect patterns.

Result: The study revealed that a few influential modules primarily drive optimization performance, with low variability in module importance across different problem classes.

Conclusion: Only a few key modules significantly influence algorithmic performance in the PSO-X framework, providing insights to streamline algorithm design and identify priority areas for enhancing modular optimization frameworks.

Abstract: The PSO-X framework incorporates dozens of modules that have been proposed for solving single-objective continuous optimization problems using particle swarm optimization. While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MHRC-Bench, a multilingual benchmark specifically for hardware code completion, addressing a gap in existing benchmarks that primarily focus on software programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code completion are mostly software-focused, neglecting hardware description languages, which are critical in hardware design tasks.

Method: The authors create MHRC-Bench, which comprises a training and evaluation dataset designed for hardware code completion, annotated with structured and semantic labels through syntax tree analysis.

Result: Evaluation results underscore the benchmark's relevance and effectiveness in assessing code completion performance across hardware coding styles.

Conclusion: MHRC-Bench fills a key gap in repository-level code completion benchmarking, targeting hardware description language tasks and fostering progress in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on code completion tasks in general-purpose programming languages. However, existing repository-level code completion benchmarks focus almost exclusively on software code and largely overlook hardware description languages. In this work, we present \textbf{MHRC-Bench}, consisting of \textbf{MHRC-Bench-Train} and \textbf{MHRC-Bench-Eval}, the first benchmark designed for multilingual hardware code completion at the repository level. Our benchmark targets completion tasks and covers three major hardware design coding styles. Each completion target is annotated with code-structure-level and hardware-oriented semantic labels derived from concrete syntax tree analysis. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of models on MHRC-Bench-Eval. Comprehensive evaluation results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of MHRC-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proof engineering is labor-intensive and challenging; leveraging LLMs for automation can significantly reduce human effort and enhance productivity.

Method: The approach applies off-the-shelf LLM agents with proof-checking tools for assisting in proof scripting tasks, demonstrated via mechanizing a complex formal system (System Capless) in Lean 4.

Result: The LLM agents successfully completed 189 proof engineering tasks with an 87% success rate, requiring minimal (16%) human intervention.

Conclusion: LLM agents are effective at proof engineering, improving productivity by addressing mechanical tasks but still require human creativity and guidance for complex reasoning.

Abstract: Proof engineering is notoriously labor-intensive: proofs that are straightforward on paper often require lengthy scripts in theorem provers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) create new opportunities for proof automation: modern LLMs not only generate proof scripts, but also support agentic behavior, exploring codebases and iteratively refining their outputs against prover feedback. These advances enable an emerging scheme where LLM-based agents undertake most proof engineering under human guidance. Humans provide mathematical insight (definitions, theorems, proof strategies); agents handle the mechanical work of proof development. We call this scheme agentic proof automation. We present this scheme through a case study: mechanizing the semantic type soundness of a sophisticated formal system, System Capless, in Lean 4, comprising over 14,000 lines of code. Using off-the-shelf LLM agents with a single lightweight proof-checking tool, the agents completed 189 proof engineering tasks with an 87% success rate, only 16% requiring human intervention. The case study demonstrates that agents are capable proof engineers that substantially boost productivity, though they fall short in creative reasoning and still require human guidance in certain cases. We release an interactive explorer where readers can examine all agent interactions; the mechanization is open-sourced for experiments and extensions.

*Ivan Perez,Angel Herranz*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper offers a method to integrate logic programming seamlessly into typed functional programming, implemented successfully in Haskell.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome resistance and integrate logic programming concepts into communities of typed functional programming, addressing a gap in language adoption.

Method: The approach utilizes extensible types to embed logic variables, develops a unification algorithm suitable for polymorphic data structures, and creates a domain-specific language for defining and querying predicates.

Result: The proposed method was successfully implemented in Haskell, showing practical and effective integration of logic programming.

Conclusion: The integration of logic programming into typed functional languages is technically feasible and practically beneficial, enhancing their capabilities without compromising static typing or functional strengths.

Abstract: Logic programming languages present clear advantages in terms of declarativeness and conciseness. However, the ideas of logic programming have been met with resistance in other programming communities, and have not generally been adopted by other paradigms and languages. This paper proposes a novel way to incorporate logic programming in an existing codebase in a typed functional programming language. Our approach integrates with the host language without sacrificing static typing, and leverages strengths of typed functional programming such as polymorphism and higher-order. We do so by combining three ideas. First, we use the extensible types technique to allow values of the host language to contain logic variables. Second, we implement a unification algorithm that works for any data structure that supports certain operations.Third, we introduce a domain-specific language to define and query predicates. We demonstrate our proposal via a series of examples, and provide aids to make the notation convenient for users, showing that the proposed approach is not just technically possible but also practical. Our ideas have been implemented in the language Haskell with very good results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FORCE, a framework for synthesizing first-order logic formulas from examples to improve transition system invariant inference, optimizing enumeration and pruning techniques, and enabling faster and more flexible frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance existing methodologies and develop efficient techniques for first-order logic formula synthesis to accelerate invariant inference in systems.

Method: They use answer set programming (ASP), propose 'orthogonal slices' for partitioning the search space, and implement incremental pruning techniques with the FORCE framework.

Result: FORCE accelerates existing invariant synthesis algorithms and supports composition of frameworks, leading to novel optimizations.

Conclusion: FORCE improves formula synthesis processes by optimizing search spaces, accelerating algorithms, and enabling framework composition for better invariant inference.

Abstract: We present a framework for synthesising formulas in first-order logic (FOL) from examples, which unifies and advances state-of-the-art approaches for inference of transition system invariants. To do so, we study and categorise the existing methodologies, encoding techniques in their formula synthesis via answer set programming (ASP). Based on the derived categorisation, we propose orthogonal slices, a new technique for formula enumeration that partitions the search space into manageable chunks, enabling two approaches for incremental candidate pruning. Using a combination of existing techniques for first-order (FO) invariant synthesis and the orthogonal slices implemented in our framework FORCE, we significantly accelerate a state-of-the-art algorithm for distributed system invariant inference. We also show that our approach facilitates composition of different invariant inference frameworks, allowing for novel optimisations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend GP 2 language capabilities by efficiently integrating binary search tree operations using graph transformations.

Method: The method involves using GP 2's rooted graph transformation rules to implement insertion, deletion, and query operations in binary search trees.

Result: This implementation achieves worst-case O(n) and average-case O(log(n)) for operational runtime, aligning with established behaviors in binary search tree algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach successfully matches binary search tree complexities found in imperative languages, offering a fast rule-based graph programming solution.

Abstract: We present an approach to implement binary search trees in the rule-based graph programming language GP 2. Our implementation uses GP 2's rooted graph transformation rules to be fast and supports insertion, deletion and query operations. We argue that the worst-case runtime for each of the operations is O(n) for a tree with n nodes. In addition, we expect that, on average, the operations run in time O(log(n)). Hence the implementation would match the time complexity of binary search trees implementations in imperative languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code similarity metrics rely heavily on surface-level or syntax-based features, which fail to capture deeper semantic relationships in code.

Method: The proposed CSSG metric uses program dependence graphs to represent control dependencies and variable interactions, enabling a semantics-aware understanding of code.

Result: CSSG outperforms existing metrics on the CodeContests+ dataset in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings, proving its efficacy in measuring code similarity.

Conclusion: Dependency-aware graph representations, as seen in CSSG, are a more effective approach for code similarity analysis compared to traditional surface-level or syntax-based methods.

Abstract: Existing code similarity metrics, such as BLEU, CodeBLEU, and TSED, largely rely on surface-level string overlap or abstract syntax tree structures, and often fail to capture deeper semantic relationships between programs.We propose CSSG (Code Similarity using Semantic Graphs), a novel metric that leverages program dependence graphs to explicitly model control dependencies and variable interactions, providing a semantics-aware representation of code.Experiments on the CodeContests+ dataset show that CSSG consistently outperforms existing metrics in distinguishing more similar code from less similar code under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings, demonstrating that dependency-aware graph representations offer a more effective alternative to surface-level or syntax-based similarity measures.

*Timothy Barfoot,Cedric Le Gentil,Sven Lilge*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a global Gaussian Process (GP) prior on Lie groups for continuous-time state estimation, enhancing theoretical foundations via the Magnus expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve continuous-time state estimation, addressing issues with asynchronous measurements, smooth estimation, and observability challenges in moving sensors on Lie groups.

Method: The authors introduce a global GP prior on Lie groups using the Magnus expansion, rather than relying on a patchwork of local GPs with individual kernels.

Result: The global GP prior is shown to provide a more elegant and general solution, and the authors perform numerical comparisons demonstrating its merits relative to previous methods.

Conclusion: The approach advances the theoretical foundation of continuous-time estimation on Lie groups, offering a unified and generalizable method.

Abstract: Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.

TL;DR: The paper discusses autonomous cargo transport on the lunar surface using a rover equipped with Lidar Teach and Repeat technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise navigation and autonomous cargo pickup/delivery on the hazardous lunar surface.

Method: Using Lidar Teach and Repeat on a one-tonne rover to teach routes remotely and autonomously repeat them for cargo transport with high accuracy.

Result: The rover successfully repeated the taught paths autonomously, ensuring cargo collection and delivery in harsh conditions.

Conclusion: Lidar Teach and Repeat is an effective solution for autonomous cargo transport on the lunar surface under challenging conditions.

Abstract: In future operations on the lunar surface, automated vehicles will be required to transport cargo between known locations. Such vehicles must be able to navigate precisely in safe regions to avoid natural hazards, human-constructed infrastructure, and dangerous dark shadows. Rovers must be able to park their cargo autonomously within a small tolerance to achieve a successful pickup and delivery. In this field test, Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for transporting cargo in this way. A one-tonne path-to-flight rover was driven in a semi-autonomous remote-control mode to create a network of safe paths. Once the route was taught, the rover immediately repeated the entire network of paths autonomously while carrying cargo. The closed-loop performance is accurate enough to align the vehicle to the cargo and pick it up. This field report describes a two-week deployment at the Canadian Space Agency's Analogue Terrain, culminating in a simulated lunar operation to evaluate the system's capabilities. Successful cargo collection and delivery were demonstrated in harsh environmental conditions.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a framework for task planning without relying on task-specific knowledge, enhancing adaptability and automation.

Method: The method leverages LLMs to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks, generate behavior trees for execution, and refine them dynamically during task execution.

Result: Experimental validation in AI2-THOR simulator shows improved task performance compared to approaches using task-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates LLMs' capability in addressing ZKTP problems, offering an effective framework for automated behavior generation without task-specific configurations.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and formalize the Zero-Knowledge Task Planning (ZKTP) problem, i.e., formulating a sequence of actions to achieve some goal without task-specific knowledge. Additionally, we present a first investigation and approach for ZKTP that leverages a large language model (LLM) to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and generate behavior trees (BTs) for execution. If errors arise during task execution, the approach also uses an LLM to adjust the BTs on-the-fly in a refinement loop. Experimental validation in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in improving overall task performance compared to alternative approaches that leverage task-specific knowledge. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to effectively address several aspects of the ZKTP problem, providing a robust framework for automated behavior generation with no task-specific setup.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of wildfire monitoring under extreme conditions like visual degradation and evolving dynamics, and the lack of physically realistic training data and frameworks in existing methods.

Method: The authors employ a high-fidelity wildfire digital twin simulation to train a vision-language model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) agent, using both UAV sensing and semantic reward shaping.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves UAV navigation for wildfire monitoring, reducing detection time by up to 6 times, increasing visibility, and demonstrating feasibility in large-scale, physically realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel solution integrating physics-aware simulation, vision-language-based guidance, and reinforcement learning to advance real-world wildfire monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: Wildfire monitoring demands autonomous systems capable of reasoning under extreme visual degradation, rapidly evolving physical dynamics, and scarce real-world training data. Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.

TL;DR: The paper proposes OFF-EMMA, an end-to-end multimodal framework for efficient trajectory planning in off-road terrains, enhancing spatial perception and reasoning capabilities of autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for off-road trajectory planning face adaptability challenges in dynamic environments, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: OFF-EMMA introduces a visual prompt block using semantic segmentation masks and a chain-of-thought with self-consistency reasoning strategy to optimize trajectory planning performance.

Result: OFF-EMMA improved the Qwen model's average L2 error by 13.3% and reduced the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56% on the RELLIS-3D dataset.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust solution for off-road autonomous driving with significant improvements in accuracy and reliability compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Efficient trajectory planning in off-road terrains presents a formidable challenge for autonomous vehicles, often necessitating complex multi-step pipelines. However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a MIDI-to-motion pipeline for robotic cello performance, achieves human-like sound without motion capture, and provides a dataset and evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise control in robot musicianship, particularly for string instruments like the cello, where challenges arise with bow angle and pressure control.

Method: Development of an end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline using collision-aware bowing motions and the UR5e robot with Freedrive features, recording real-time joint data, and introducing a Musical Turing Test for evaluation.

Result: The robotic cellist achieves human-like sound quality, live labeled joint data is provided, and effectiveness is validated via a Musical Turing Test involving 132 human participants.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a viable benchmark for robotic cello performance, with reinforcement learning proposed for future improvements in control and sound quality.

Abstract: Robot musicians require precise control to obtain proper note accuracy, sound quality, and musical expression. Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.
  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.

TL;DR: This paper presents Locomotion Beyond Feet, a system enabling humanoid robots to use whole-body contacts for traversal in challenging terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of leg-based locomotion methods and enable humanoids to navigate complex environments using whole-body motions.

Method: Combines physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning within a hierarchical framework including terrain-specific policies, recovery mechanisms, and vision-based planning.

Result: The proposed system achieves robust whole-body locomotion and adaptability across varied terrains in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Locomotion Beyond Feet expands humanoid mobility beyond leg-based gaits, enhancing stability and versatility in navigating diverse terrains.

Abstract: Most locomotion methods for humanoid robots focus on leg-based gaits, yet natural bipeds frequently rely on hands, knees, and elbows to establish additional contacts for stability and support in complex environments. This paper introduces Locomotion Beyond Feet, a comprehensive system for whole-body humanoid locomotion across extremely challenging terrains, including low-clearance spaces under chairs, knee-high walls, knee-high platforms, and steep ascending and descending stairs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, are embodiment-specific, and can be readily validated in simulation or on hardware, while reinforcement learning transforms these references into robust, physically accurate motions. We further employ a hierarchical framework consisting of terrain-specific motion-tracking policies, failure recovery mechanisms, and a vision-based skill planner. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Locomotion Beyond Feet achieves robust whole-body locomotion and generalizes across obstacle sizes, obstacle instances, and terrain sequences.

TL;DR: The paper tackles multi-robot collaborative area search by balancing exploration of unknown areas and target coverage using a Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance tasks like exploration and target rescue efficiently due to homogeneous graph representations.

Method: The method constructs a heterogeneous graph with three entity types and uses a dual-attention mechanism to manage relationship dynamics and decouple exploration from specific coverage tasks.

Result: Experiments in 3D simulated environments show the approach's scalability and generalization capability.

Conclusion: The DA-HGNN effectively addresses the multi-task challenge in area search, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In multi-robot collaborative area search, a key challenge is to dynamically balance the two objectives of exploring unknown areas and covering specific targets to be rescued. Existing methods are often constrained by homogeneous graph representations, thus failing to model and balance these distinct tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN) trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our method constructs a heterogeneous graph that incorporates three entity types: robot nodes, frontier nodes, and interesting nodes, as well as their historical states. The dual-attention mechanism comprises the relational-aware attention and type-aware attention operations. The relational-aware attention captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among robots and candidate goals. Building on this relational-aware heterogeneous graph, the type-aware attention separately computes the relevance between robots and each goal type (frontiers vs. points of interest), thereby decoupling the exploration and coverage from the unified tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive 3D scenarios within the iGibson simulator, leveraging the Gibson and MatterPort3D datasets, validate the superior scalability and generalization capability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: PointWorld is a 3D world model that predicts object displacement in 3D space using RGB-D images and low-level robotic commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robotic manipulation capabilities by anticipating 3D environmental reactions to robot actions, inspired by human spatial understanding.

Method: Introduced PointWorld, a unified 3D world model using 3D point flows trained on large-scale datasets from real and simulated robotic interactions.

Result: PointWorld demonstrates real-world robotic manipulation capabilities, including deformable object handling and tool usage, without needing demonstrations or retraining.

Conclusion: The study introduces an efficient, generalizable 3D prediction model for robotic manipulation, integrating seamlessly across robot embodiments using a shared 3D space representation.

Abstract: Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

### [310] [Generational Replacement and Learning for High-Performing and Diverse Populations in Evolvable Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03807)
*K. Ege de Bruin,Kyrre Glette,Kai Olav Ellefsen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses improving evolutionary robotics by combining intra-life learning and generational replacement, addressing challenges of adaptation time and population diversity while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in co-optimizing robot morphology and control due to adaptation time and lack of diversity in evolutionary robotics populations.

Method: The method involves integrating intra-life learning (an additional controller optimization loop) and full generational replacement to enhance diversity and retain performance during evolutionary processes.

Result: Combining generational replacement with intra-life learning increases diversity without sacrificing robot performance. Additionally, different performance metrics give varying evaluations of learning.

Conclusion: Using intra-life learning and generational replacement together can balance performance and diversity in evolving robotic populations, and performance metrics need to be carefully chosen for accurate evaluation.

Abstract: Evolutionary Robotics offers the possibility to design robots to solve a specific task automatically by optimizing their morphology and control together. However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.

### [311] [Integrating Sample Inheritance into Bayesian Optimization for Evolutionary Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03813)
*K. Ege de Bruin,Kyrre Glette,Kai Olav Ellefsen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how inheritance mechanisms in evolutionary robotics, particularly using Bayesian optimization, enhance robot design efficiency under low learning budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize robot morphology and control simultaneously in evolutionary robotics, addressing the high controller learning budget usually required.

Method: The authors utilized Bayesian optimization for efficient controller optimization and investigated two sample inheritance strategies: (1) transferring parent's samples as priors without reevaluation and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on offspring, comparing them to a baseline without inheritance.

Result: Reevaluation-based inheritance performed best, followed by prior-based inheritance, both exceeding performance without inheritance. Inheritance strategies mitigated low learning budget issues and benefited morphologies similar to parents, while challenging environments improved gait stability.

Conclusion: Inheritance mechanisms, particularly reevaluation-based, improve performance and efficiency in evolutionary robotics design, allowing advancements with constrained learning budgets.

Abstract: In evolutionary robotics, robot morphologies are designed automatically using evolutionary algorithms. This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving systems, emphasizing a real-time embedded trajectory planner to operate under constrained computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety layers for Autonomous Vehicles detect unsafe planning outputs but do not ensure continued safe operation when the main planner fails.

Method: The authors implement a lightweight, sampling-based trajectory planner on an embedded platform using a Real-Time Operating System to ensure continued operation under resource constraints.

Result: Experimental results reveal that the planner achieves deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, making it viable for safety-certifiable hardware.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating active fallback mechanisms, forming the foundation for safer next-generation Autonomous Driving systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) requires motion planning modules that not only operate within strict real-time constraints but also maintain controllability in case of system faults. Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware. The study highlights both the potential and the remaining challenges of integrating active fallback mechanisms as an integral part of next-generation safeguarding frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tactile sensing system combining Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) with a silicone optical waveguide skin, achieving press localization with high accuracy and robustness, even under sparse event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a flexible and responsive tactile sensing system suitable for soft robotics and interactive environments.

Method: The method involves a stereo vision setup using DVS cameras to triangulate press positions on a 2D skin surface, leveraging DBSCAN clustering for event localization.

Result: The system achieved a press localization RMSE of 4.66 mm across 95% of visible presses and maintained functionality with sparse data, with slight increase in error to 9.33 mm.

Conclusion: The sensing system is promising for creating efficient tactile sensing solutions in terms of accuracy, low latency, and event data reduction, with potential applications in robotics and interactive systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic, event-driven tactile sensing system for soft, large-area skin, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) integrated with a flexible silicone optical waveguide skin. Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoINS, a hierarchical framework for robotic interactive navigation that integrates skill-aware reasoning with robust execution, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) in robotic planning are limited as they focus on semantic reasoning but fail to understand robots' physical interaction capabilities, crucial for tasks like clearing blocked paths.

Method: The proposed CoINS framework fine-tunes a vision-language model (InterNav-VLM) to include skill affordance and constraint parameters via counterfactual reasoning, and pairs it with a robust skill library for object manipulation developed using reinforcement learning.

Result: Through a systematic benchmark in a simulation and real-world tests, CoINS outperformed baselines by 17% in overall success rate and showed over 80% improvement in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: CoINS closes the gap in interactive navigation by enabling robots to reason about and actively interact with their environments, resulting in significant performance gains in path clearance and navigation tasks.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in robotic planning. However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that CoINS significantly outperforms representative baselines, achieving a 17\% higher overall success rate and over 80\% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios compared to the best-performing baseline

TL;DR: This paper introduces Residual Semantic Steering (RSS), a novel framework designed to improve the robustness of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models under linguistic perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of modality collapse, where strong visual priors overpower linguistic cues, making VLA models brittle to variations in instruction phrasing.

Method: The authors propose RSS, which combines Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration for semantic posterior approximation and Residual Affordance Steering to isolate the influence of language in dual-stream decoding.

Result: RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness in robotic manipulation benchmarks, retaining performance even under adversarial linguistic conditions.

Conclusion: Residual Semantic Steering effectively enhances the robustness of VLA models by disentangling visual and linguistic signals, ensuring better alignment of actions with semantic intent.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generalized robotic control; however, they remain notoriously brittle to linguistic perturbations. We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.

Motivation: To address challenges in robotic learning by leveraging abundant human video data and overcoming issues of visual entanglement in existing models.

Method: Introduces CLAP framework using contrastive latent alignment, a dual-model (CLAP-NTP and CLAP-RF), and KM regularization for skill transfer efficiency.

Result: CLAP achieves superior performance over baselines, effectively transferring human video skills to robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: CLAP provides an advanced vision-language-action framework bridging human video demonstrations and robotic execution, enhancing skill generalization and precision.

Abstract: Generalist Vision-Language-Action models are currently hindered by the scarcity of robotic data compared to the abundance of human video demonstrations. Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the evaluation of video foundation models for Embodied AI tasks using the new benchmark WoW-World-Eval and highlights critical limitations in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the generative generalization, perceptual fidelity, and robustness of video foundation models as universal priors for embodied agents.

Method: The authors propose the WoW-World-Eval benchmark, which examines five core abilities and offers a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics for assessing video models' generation ability and real-world execution.

Result: Models scored poorly on core abilities like long-horizon planning (17.27) and physical consistency (at best 68.02), with a noticeable gap between model performances and real-world execution accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for improved benchmarks and the advancement of video foundation models to enhance their applicability as predictive world models in Embodied AI.

Abstract: As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.

The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: The paper integrates an autonomous AgentSpeak program with a two-wheeled robot to solve mazes efficiently, proving that high-level decision-making is feasible for resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable resource-constrained embedded devices to independently make decisions in dynamic environments, improving responsiveness and reducing reliance on external control.

Method: The authors integrated an AgentSpeak-programmed autonomous agent with a two-wheeled robot capable of exploring mazes using its own decision-making and sensor data.

Result: The agent successfully solved a maze efficiently in 59 seconds, completing 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that agent-based high-level control is efficient and feasible for real-time use on resource-limited embedded systems.

Abstract: Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.

### [320] [The Anatomy of a Successful Student Scrum Team: Motivation, Personalities, and Academic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03364)
*Nadia Damianova,Santiago Berrezueta-Guzman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how Scrum practices were adapted for a year-long student VR game development project under academic and hybrid work challenges, focusing on communication tools, hybrid work impact, and aligning with academic schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how agile practices, specifically Scrum, can function effectively in long-running, student-led projects under academic constraints and hybrid work environments.

Method: The study analyzed an eight-person student development team creating a VR game, using qualitative observations, communication artifacts (Discord, Notion, GitHub), contribution metrics, and a custom communication effectiveness index.

Result: The findings reveal that lightweight coordination tools ensured consistent progress, adaptations made Scrum compatible with academic rhythms, and shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were critical for success.

Conclusion: Practical recommendations for adapting Scrum to hybrid, project-based learning environments are proposed, emphasizing flexible ceremonies, effective communication tooling, and the importance of team dynamics.

Abstract: Agile methods, and Scrum in particular, are widely taught in software engineering education; however, there is limited empirical evidence on how these practices function in long-running, student-led projects under academic and hybrid work constraints. This paper presents a year-long case study of an eight-person student development team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual reality game that simulates a university campus and provides program-related educational content. We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics. We propose practical recommendations for instructors and student teams adopting agile methods in hybrid, project-based learning settings.

### [321] [RepoShapley: Shapley-Enhanced Context Filtering for Repository-Level Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03378)
*Yu Huo,Siyu Zhang,Kun Zeng,Yuquan Lu,Cheng Yang,Yifu Guo,Xiaoying Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoShapley is a mechanism for improving repository-level code completion by using Shapley-style contribution measures to control cross-file evidence and filter contexts effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code completion often involves multiple files, where the usefulness of snippets depends on complex interactions. Controlling cross-file evidence to optimize utility without introducing harmful or irrelevant content is challenging.

Method: RepoShapley calculates the marginal contributions of chunks using Shapley values. Its framework includes single-chunk probing, a surrogate game for better context interaction handling, Shapley computation for retrieval sets, and post-decision verification. Verified outcomes are integrated into a single model using control tokens.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RepoShapley enhances completion quality, minimizes harmful or irrelevant context, and reduces redundant data retrieval across diverse benchmarks and backbone architectures.

Conclusion: RepoShapley provides an effective, systematic way to improve repository-level code completion by selectively integrating helpful contexts and avoiding interference from irrelevant or harmful data.

Abstract: Repository-level code completion benefits from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, controlling cross-file evidence is difficult because chunk utility is often interaction-dependent: some snippets help only when paired with complementary context, while others harm decoding when they conflict. We propose RepoShapley, a coalition-aware context filtering framework supervised by Shapley-style marginal contributions. Our module ChunkShapley constructs offline labels by (i) single-chunk probing with teacher-forced likelihood to estimate signed, weighted effects, (ii) a surrogate game that captures saturation and interference, (iii) exact Shapley computation for small retrieval sets, and (iv) bounded post-verification that selects a decoding-optimal coalition using the frozen generator. We distill verified $KEEP$ or $DROP$ decisions and retrieval triggering into a single model via discrete control tokens. Experiments across benchmarks and backbones show that RepoShapley improves completion quality while reducing harmful context and unnecessary retrieval.

*Mohamed Ouf,Shayan Noei,Zeph Van Iterson,Mariam Guizani,Ying Zou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates the dynamics of mission-driven OSS4SG and conventional OSS communities through an empirical study of GitHub repositories, revealing distinct patterns in community stability, engagement, and contributor roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the mission-driven nature of OSS4SG projects impacts their development practices, community structures, and contributor participation.

Method: An empirical study analyzing data from 1,039 GitHub repositories, including 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects. Comparisons were made on community structure, engagement patterns, and coding practices.

Result: OSS4SG projects exhibit more stable and committed communities (63.4% stability), year-round consistent engagement, and rely heavily on core contributors. Conventional OSS projects attract higher contributor turnover (75.4%) and show seasonal engagement variations.

Conclusion: Mission-driven OSS4SG projects demonstrate unique and sustainable community dynamics distinct from conventional OSS, highlighting the role of core contributors and stable engagement in their success.

Abstract: Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects aim to address critical societal challenges, such as healthcare access and community safety. Understanding the community dynamics and contributor patterns in these projects is essential for ensuring their sustainability and long-term impact. However, while extensive research has focused on conventional Open Source Software (OSS), little is known about how the mission-driven nature of OSS4SG influences its development practices. To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 1,039 GitHub repositories, comprising 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects, to compare community structure, contributor engagement, and coding practices. Our findings reveal that OSS4SG projects foster significantly more stable and "sticky" (63.4%) communities, whereas conventional OSS projects are more "magnetic" (75.4%), attracting a high turnover of contributors. OSS4SG projects also demonstrate consistent engagement throughout the year, while conventional OSS communities exhibit seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, OSS4SG projects rely heavily on core contributors for both code quality and issue resolution, while conventional OSS projects leverage casual contributors for issue resolution, with core contributors focusing primarily on code quality.

*Danny Brahman,Mohammad Mahoor*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents CodeEval, a benchmark for evaluating code generation by LLMs, and RunCodeEval, a supporting framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of detailed evaluation tools for assessing LLMs' specific strengths and weaknesses in code generation.

Method: Developed CodeEval, a benchmark dataset for 24 Python programming aspects, and RunCodeEval, a test execution framework.

Result: Provided tools allow for precise evaluation of LLMs' programming abilities and pinpoint areas for targeted improvements.

Conclusion: These tools enhance rigorous assessment and development of LLMs' programming skills, enabling better targeted enhancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly assessed based on their common sense reasoning, language comprehension, and logical reasoning abilities. While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories. This combination enables targeted evaluation and guides improvements in LLMs' programming proficiencies.

*Yuhan Wu,Huan Zhang,Wei Cheng,Chen Shen,Jingyue Yang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BootTrans, a bootstrapping method for code translation across programming languages, improving performance by leveraging unit tests and addressing optimization imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in multilingual code translation, such as lack of parallel data with test oracles and optimization issues with diverse language pairs.

Method: The method involves using adaptable test suites as verification oracles for reinforcement learning (RL) training, employing a dual-pool framework for expanding data, and incorporating a language-aware weighting mechanism to address optimization imbalance.

Result: BootTrans achieves significant improvements in code translation across multiple languages, validated through experiments on HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that BootTrans efficiently tackles multilingual code translation challenges, with strong empirical evidence supporting its dual-pool approach and dynamic weighting mechanism.

Abstract: Code translation across multiple programming languages is essential yet challenging due to two vital obstacles: scarcity of parallel data paired with executable test oracles, and optimization imbalance when handling diverse language pairs. We propose BootTrans, a bootstrapping method that resolves both obstacles. Its key idea is to leverage the functional invariance and cross-lingual portability of test suites, adapting abundant pivot-language unit tests to serve as universal verification oracles for multilingual RL training. Our method introduces a dual-pool architecture with seed and exploration pools to progressively expand training data via execution-guided experience collection. Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance. Extensive experiments on the HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline LLMs across all translation directions, with ablations validating the effectiveness of both bootstrapping and weighting components.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Deploy-Master addresses the challenge of deploying scientific tools for reproducibility and large-scale evaluation by transforming 50,112 open-source repositories into reusable, validated, containerized formats in an automated manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the challenges in compiling, configuring, and reusing open-source scientific software, which limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluations, and practical integrations into modern AI-for-Science workflows.

Method: The authors propose Deploy-Master, a workflow that starts by filtering over 500,000 repositories to 52,550 candidates using license- and quality-aware criteria. It builds and validates these repositories into executable, containerized formats, creating a reproducible runtime environment.

Result: The workflow successfully built and validated reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools within 24 hours. These tools are now available in SciencePedia for search, reuse, and agent-based integration.

Conclusion: Deploy-Master demonstrates how an agentic, large-scale, execution-based approach solves deployment challenges in scientific software and lays the groundwork for enhanced AI-for-Science integration and reproducibility.

Abstract: Open-source scientific software is abundant, yet most tools remain difficult to compile, configure, and reuse, sustaining a small-workshop mode of scientific computing. This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.
  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.
  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science.

*Sabrina Haque,Sarvesh Ingale,Christoph Csallner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study empirically evaluates testing in pull requests (PRs) created by agentic coding tools, focusing on test inclusion trends and their impact on size, processing time, and adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of agentic coding tools in pull request workflows raises questions about how testing habits evolve within these automated processes.

Method: The AIDev dataset is used to comprehensively analyze the inclusion of tests in agentic PRs, examining their frequency, introduction timing, and differences in size, time, and outcomes compared to non-test PRs.

Result: Test-containing PRs are becoming more frequent over time, are larger in size, and take longer to complete, though the merge success rate remains consistent. Variations across agents in their adoption of testing and in test/production code balance were noted.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into testing practices in agentic PRs, highlighting trends and laying groundwork for further exploration of autonomous software development practices.

Abstract: Testing is a critical practice for ensuring software correctness and long-term maintainability. As agentic coding tools increasingly submit pull requests (PRs), it becomes essential to understand how testing appears in these agent-driven workflows. Using the AIDev dataset, we present an empirical study of test inclusion in agentic pull requests. We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar. We also observe variation across agents in both test adoption and the balance between test and production code within test PRs. Our findings provide a descriptive view of testing behavior in agentic pull requests and offer empirical grounding for future studies of autonomous software development.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework named VSM--GQM--DevOps, combining Value Stream Mapping, Goal-Question-Metric, and DevOps automation to optimize delivery performance and project outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many organizations struggle to justify and prioritize DevOps automation in terms of strategic outcomes like waste reduction, delivery predictability, and quality improvements.

Method: The framework integrates Value Stream Mapping, Goal-Question-Metric paradigm, and maturity-aligned DevOps automation, with validation through mixed-method analysis including telemetry-based experiments and qualitative insights.

Result: The proposed framework offers a traceable and defensible approach for prioritizing DevOps automation investments while addressing strategic organizational needs.

Conclusion: VSM--GQM--DevOps provides a validated pathway and tools to improve delivery performance and management outcomes through targeted DevOps automation.

Abstract: DevOps automation can accelerate software delivery, yet many organizations still struggle to justify and prioritize automation work in terms of strategic project-management outcomes such as waste reduction, delivery predictability, cross-team coordination, and customer-facing quality. This paper presents \textit{VSM--GQM--DevOps}, a unified, traceable framework that integrates (i) Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to visualize the end-to-end delivery system and quantify delays, rework, and handoffs, (ii) the Goal--Question--Metric (GQM) paradigm to translate stakeholder objectives into a minimal, decision-relevant measurement model (combining DORA with project and team outcomes), and (iii) maturity-aligned DevOps automation to remediate empirically observed bottlenecks through small, reversible interventions. The framework operationalizes traceability from observed waste to goal-aligned questions, metrics, and automation candidates, and provides a defensible prioritization approach that balances expected impact, confidence, and cost. We also define a multi-site, longitudinal mixed-method validation protocol that combines telemetry-based quasi-experimental analysis (interrupted time series and, where feasible, controlled rollouts) with qualitative triangulation from interviews and retrospectives. The expected contribution is a validated pathway and a set of practical instruments that enables organizations to select automation investments that demonstrably improve both delivery performance and project-management outcomes.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores issues surrounding fairness in machine learning (ML) applications and evaluates existing fairness practices under conditions like faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing concern that ML systems, when applied in socioeconomic contexts, may unintentionally harm marginalized groups by unfairly distributing opportunities and resources. This motivates a critical evaluation of fairness practices.

Method: The paper investigates recommended fairness practices and their reliability when subjected to typical ML challenges such as faulty labels, missing data, and distribution shifts.

Result: The study evaluates the practical effectiveness and generalizability of fairness interventions in real-life scenarios with common ML challenges.

Conclusion: Current fairness practices in ML require careful consideration and testing to ensure reliability and efficacy amidst practical challenges encountered in real-world data-driven systems.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly deployed to make critical decisions in socioeconomic applications such as finance, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations? And how well do these practices generalize in the presence of faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts? These questions form the core theme of this paper.

*Mohd Ariful Haque,Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to test LLM-based code generation for transcription reliability using high-precision constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world software tasks often need flawless transcription of data into code, as errors can silently affect program validity.

Method: The authors developed a minimal benchmark task where models transcribe a list of decimal constants into Python code and perform aggregate computations. They also designed an evaluation protocol to measure string inclusion and state-tracking failures.

Result: The benchmark highlights long-horizon generation and state-tracking issues in LLMs when focusing on data integrity.

Conclusion: This benchmark complements existing evaluations, emphasizing data reliability in code generation tasks over algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: Many real-world software tasks require exact transcription of provided data into code, such as cryptographic constants, protocol test vectors, allowlists, and calibration tables. These tasks are operationally sensitive because small omissions or alterations can remain silent while producing syntactically valid programs. This paper introduces a deliberately minimal transcription-to-code benchmark to isolate this reliability concern in LLM-based code generation. Given a list of high-precision decimal constants, a model must generate Python code that embeds the constants verbatim and performs a simple aggregate computation. We describe the prompting variants, evaluation protocol based on exact-string inclusion, and analysis framework used to characterize state-tracking and long-horizon generation failures. The benchmark is intended as a compact stress test that complements existing code-generation evaluations by focusing on data integrity rather than algorithmic reasoning.

*Jia Li,Yuxin Su,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RepoReason, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating repository-level reasoning of large language models via abductive assertion verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for large language models often fail to test logical consistency across complex interdependent file systems, limiting their utility for agentic applications.

Method: The authors propose an execution-driven mutation framework to regenerate ground-truth states, combined with dynamic program slicing for fine-grained diagnostics using three metrics: reading load (ESV), simulation depth (MCL), and integration width (DFI).

Result: Evaluations show prevailing deficits in reasoning, particularly in integration width, which poses a cognitive bottleneck for frontier models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus.

Conclusion: RepoReason provides valuable insights for optimizing autonomous agent reasoning, focusing on overcoming integration width limitations in software engineering applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, evaluating repository-level reasoning, the ability to maintain logical consistency across massive, real-world, interdependent file systems, has become critical. Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.

*Md Ahasanuzzaman,Bram Adams,Emad Fallahzadeh,Gustavo A. Oliva,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The research analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks by assessing Knowledge Units (KUs) and finds existing benchmarks skewed, lacking alignment with real-world projects. It introduces a framework to rebalance benchmarks and reveals overestimated LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a gap in evaluating the alignment of code generation benchmarks with real-world programming by systematically assessing their coverage of Knowledge Units (KUs).

Method: The authors conduct an empirical KU coverage analysis on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, comparing them with real-world Python projects. They create a prompt-based framework to generate KU-balanced tasks, augment benchmarks, and evaluate LLM performance.

Result: Results show benchmarks only cover half of KUs while real-world projects utilize all KUs. Augmented benchmarks improved KU coverage and distributional alignment by over 60%, revealing performance drops in LLM evaluations on these new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Existing benchmarks misrepresent LLM performance due to skewed KU distributions. Augmented benchmarks provide a more realistic evaluation framework, offering guidance for better assessments of LLM code generation abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude and LLaMA have shown impressive performance in code generation, typically evaluated using benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval). However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.
  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.
  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs reveal fairness concerns when applied to sensitive decisions in team composition and task allocation, displaying biases based on demographic attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the potential biases when Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in socially sensitive decisions like team composition and task allocation.

Method: Analyzed combined demographic attributes (country and pronouns) using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions to identify systematic disparities in selection likelihood and task assignment.

Result: LLMs demonstrated biases with demographic attributes shaping decisions, leading to uneven task allocation and reinforcing stereotypes in technical and leadership roles.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of fairness-aware assessments as LLMs exacerbate inequities in software engineering decisions.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to boost productivity and support software engineering tasks. However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior in structured, specification-driven software workflows and to enhance developer efficacy in code generation.

Method: Developed CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension, to guide developers through Specification, Tests, and Function stages while logging interactions and code effectiveness.

Result: The study analyzes how human interventions at various development stages affect the quality and efficiency of LLM-generated code.

Conclusion: Findings will inform future design of LLM-assisted development tools to harmonize human reasoning with model outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet their behavior in structured, specification-driven processes remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study design using CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension that enables a human-in-the-loop workflow for LLM-assisted code generation. The tool guides developers through three sequential stages--Specification, Tests, and Function--allowing them to define requirements, generate and refine test suites, and produce functions that satisfy those tests. Participants will solve medium-difficulty problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset, while the tool records fine-grained interaction logs, effectiveness metrics (e.g., pass rate, all-pass completion), efficiency indicators (e.g., time-to-pass), and iteration behaviors. The study aims to analyze how human intervention in specification and test refinement influences the quality and dynamics of LLM-generated code. The results will provide empirical insights into the design of next-generation development environments that align human reasoning with model-driven code generation.

Conclusion: SLMs show promise in enhancing the understanding of data science practices but are affected by variations in taxonomy definitions.

Abstract: Background: Extracting the stages that structure Machine Learning (ML) pipelines from source code is key for gaining a deeper understanding of data science practices. However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.
  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.
  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis is conducted using Pearson's chi-squared tests to compare our insights on data science practices with those from prior studies.

### [335] [An Ontology-Based Approach to Security Risk Identification of Container Deployments in OT Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04010)
*Yannick Landeck,Dian Balta,Martin Wimmer,Christian Knierim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Use of the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO) to assess and mitigate security risks in containerized OT deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Containerized OT deployments often require elevated privileges, reducing isolation and increasing security risks. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability, and integration.

Method: Development of the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO) incorporating adversarial behavior, assumptions, attack scenarios, risk rules, and security artefacts.

Result: CSRO enables automated, reproducible risk identification, demonstrated in a case study.

Conclusion: CSRO provides a solid foundation for analyzing security risks in OT systems, with potential extension for broader risk factors.

Abstract: In operational technology (OT) contexts, containerised applications often require elevated privileges to access low-level network interfaces or perform administrative tasks such as application monitoring. These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.

### [336] [Smells Depend on the Context: An Interview Study of Issue Tracking Problems and Smells in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04124)
*Lloyd Montgomery,Clara Lüders,Christian Rahe,Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs) within software engineering teams through interviews and thematic analysis, identifying major problems and contextual dependencies of ITS smells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of understanding about challenges and problematic practices (ITS smells) encountered by software engineering teams in Issue Tracking Systems.

Method: The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 26 experienced software engineering professionals and analyzed their responses using Thematic Analysis.

Result: The study identified 14 common problems in ITSs, including findability issues, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Context factors such as configuration, workflow stage, and team size influence the occurrence of ITS smells.

Conclusion: ITS challenges and problematic practices are highly context-dependent, suggesting the need for tool-based solutions that enable better configuration, monitoring, and visualization of ITS smells to address these challenges.

Abstract: Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs) enable software developers and managers to collect and resolve issues collaboratively. While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like "priority" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.

*Yago Emanoel Ramos,Raphael Silva do Rosário,Adriana de Faria Gehres,Maria João Alves,Ana Maria Leitão,Cecília Bastos da Costa Accioly,Fatima Wachowicz,Ivani Lúcia Oliveira de Santana,José Garcia Vivas Miranda*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores how training impacts synchronization patterns in movement and brain signals during collaborative dance improvisation. The results reveal increased inter-brain synchronization and decreased motor synchrony post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how training influences spontaneous synchronization in movement and neural activity during collaborative dance improvisation, shedding light on emergent neural-motor coordination in human systems.

Method: The study employed dual-recording methods, combining 3D motion capture and EEG hyperscanning during different types of improvisation (free, interaction-driven, and rule-based) before and after a generative dance training program.

Result: The training led to increased synchronization in brain activity, especially in the frontal lobe, but decreased synchronization in motor behavior. This suggests neural alignment enables broader individual motor exploration.

Conclusion: Collaborative improvisation enhances inter-brain synchronization while reducing motor synchronization, exemplifying the coupling-decoupling paradox in social coordination. This provides insights into creative joint action dynamics in human systems.

Abstract: Collective improvisation in dance provides a rich natural laboratory for studying emergent coordination in coupled neuro-motor systems. Here, we investigate how training shapes spontaneous synchronization patterns in both movement and brain signals during collaborative performance. Using a dual-recording protocol integrating 3D motion capture and hyperscanning EEG, participants engaged in free, interaction-driven, and rule-based improvisation before and after a program of generative dance, grounded in cellular-automata. Motor behavior was modeled through a time-resolved α-exponent derived from Movement Element Decomposition scaling between mean velocity and displacement, revealing fluctuations in energetic strategies and degrees of freedom. Synchronization events were quantified using Motif Synchronization (biomechanical data) and multilayer Time-Varying Graphs (neural data), enabling the detection of nontrivial lead-lag dependencies beyond zero-lag entrainment. Results indicate that training produced an intriguing dissociation: inter-brain synchronization increased, particularly within the frontal lobe, while interpersonal motor synchrony decreased. This opposite trend suggests that enhanced participatory sense-making fosters neural alignment while simultaneously expanding individual motor explorations, thereby reducing coupling in movement. Our findings position collaborative improvisation as a complex dynamical regime in which togetherness emerges not from identical motor outputs but from shared neural intentionality distributed across multilayer interaction networks, exemplifying the coupling-decoupling paradox, whereby increasing inter-brain synchrony supports the exploration of broader and mutually divergent motor trajectories. These results highlight the nonlinear nature of social coordination, offering new avenues for modeling creative joint action in human systems.

*Brett J. Kagan,Valentina Baccetti,Brian D. Earp,J. Lomax Boyd,Julian Savulescu,Adeel Razi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to understand agency in systems by categorizing them into three classes based on their information processing dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative and universal definitions of agency in systems, especially with the evolution of intelligent systems across varied platforms.

Method: The framework introduces three classes of information-processing systems (reactive memoryless systems, memory-driven systems, adaptive systems) and uses examples to illustrate its validity.

Result: A substrate-independent hierarchy for agency based on dynamic information processing is presented and validated with computational and neurophysiological examples.

Conclusion: These hierarchical classifications offer a measurable approach to identify the informational precursors of agency and have ethical and functional implications in evaluating such systems.

Abstract: As intelligent systems are developed across diverse substrates - from machine learning models and neuromorphic hardware to in vitro neural cultures - understanding what gives a system agency has become increasingly important. Existing definitions, however, tend to rely on top-down descriptions that are difficult to quantify. We propose a bottom-up framework grounded in a system's information-processing order: the extent to which its transformation of input evolves over time. We identify three orders of information processing. Class I systems are reactive and memoryless, mapping inputs directly to outputs. Class II systems incorporate internal states that provide memory but follow fixed transformation rules. Class III systems are adaptive; their transformation rules themselves change as a function of prior activity. While not sufficient on their own, these dynamics represent necessary informational conditions for genuine agency. This hierarchy offers a measurable, substrate-independent way to identify the informational precursors of agency. We illustrate the framework with neurophysiological and computational examples, including thermostats and receptor-like memristors, and discuss its implications for the ethical and functional evaluation of systems that may exhibit agency.

*Christopher Gabaldon,Adria Mulero,Rong Wang,Daniel A. Martin,Sabrina Camargo,Qian-Yuan Tang,Ignacio Cifre,Changsong Zhou,Dante R. Chialvo*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper develops a data-driven framework to characterize brain dynamical states using correlation matrices, offering a robust descriptor for identifying dynamics across individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an interpretable, subject-specific method to assess large-scale brain dynamics without relying on arbitrary threshold selection.

Method: The framework employs percolation-like analysis of correlation matrices, resulting in an intrinsic threshold ($r_c$) that characterizes brain states.

Result: Application to a large resting-state fMRI dataset demonstrates $r_c$’s stability and ability to correlate with known dynamical indicators. Simulations confirm its sensitivity to changes in brain dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework replaces arbitrary thresholds with physically interpretable descriptors, enabling systematic comparisons of brain states across individuals.

Abstract: We present a data-driven framework to characterize large-scale brain dynamical states directly from correlation matrices at the single-subject level. By treating correlation thresholding as a percolation-like probe of connectivity, the approach tracks multiple cluster- and network-level observables and identifies a characteristic percolation threshold, rc, at which these signatures converge. We use $r_c$ as an operational and physically interpretable descriptor of large-scale brain dynamical state. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 996), the method yields stable, subject-specific estimates that covary systematically with established dynamical indicators such as temporal autocorrelations. Numerical simulations of a whole-brain model with a known critical regime further show that $r_c$ tracks changes in collective dynamics under controlled variations of excitability. By replacing arbitrary threshold selection with a criterion intrinsic to correlation structure, the r-spectra provides a physically grounded approach for comparing brain dynamical states across individuals.

### [340] [Stigmergic optimal transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04111)
*Vishaal Krishnan,L. Mahadevan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper develops a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport, demonstrating emergent behaviors like path straightening and refraction in environments using local agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and model how decentralized mechanisms, particularly stigmergy, can enable efficient navigation of agents in swarms, particularly minimizing traversal time or energy.

Method: A stochastic optimal control framework is designed where agents both lay and follow trails to minimize traversal time. Simulations and analysis are used to study emergent behaviors.

Result: The analysis reveals two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at interfaces, aligning with insect trail observations.

Conclusion: Local noisy agent interactions in stigmergy enable geodesic navigation in heterogeneous environments without centralized coordination, guided by a slow-fast dynamic mechanism.

Abstract: Efficient navigation in swarms often relies on the emergence of decentralized approaches that minimize traversal time or energy. Stigmergy, where agents modify a shared environment that then modifies their behavior, is a classic mechanism that can encode this strategy. We develop a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport by casting it as a stochastic optimal control problem: agents (collectively) lay and (individually) follow trails while minimizing expected traversal time. Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails. While reminiscent of Fermat's principle, our results show how local, noisy agent+field interactions can give rise to geodesic trajectories in heterogeneous environments, without centralized coordination or global knowledge, relying instead on an embodied slow fast dynamical mechanism.

*Carles Balsells-Rodas,Toshiko Matsui,Pedro A. M. Mediano,Yixin Wang,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes identifiability for deep regime-switching time series models, introducing a framework for multi-lag Regime-Switching Models (RSMs) and providing theoretical and practical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifiability in deep latent variable models is essential for ensuring interpretability and uniqueness, but it has been underexplored for deep regime-switching time series.

Method: The study develops a theoretical framework for multi-lag RSMs, proves identifiability for Markov Switching Models (MSMs) and Switching Dynamical Systems (SDSs), and provides a variational estimator enforceable via neural network design.

Result: The results ensure identifiability in unsupervised settings and validate their approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, enhancing interpretability for applications in neuroscience, finance, and climate.

Conclusion: Identifiability achieved through the proposed methods enables more trustworthy interpretability, advancing scientific discovery in critical real-world domains.

Abstract: Identifiability is central to the interpretability of deep latent variable models, ensuring parameterisations are uniquely determined by the data-generating distribution. However, it remains underexplored for deep regime-switching time series. We develop a general theoretical framework for multi-lag Regime-Switching Models (RSMs), encompassing Markov Switching Models (MSMs) and Switching Dynamical Systems (SDSs). For MSMs, we formulate the model as a temporally structured finite mixture and prove identifiability of both the number of regimes and the multi-lag transitions in a nonlinear-Gaussian setting. For SDSs, we establish identifiability of the latent variables up to permutation and scaling via temporal structure, which in turn yields conditions for identifiability of regime-dependent latent causal graphs (up to regime/node permutations). Our results hold in a fully unsupervised setting through architectural and noise assumptions that are directly enforceable via neural network design. We complement the theory with a flexible variational estimator that satisfies the assumptions and validate the results on synthetic benchmarks. Across real-world datasets from neuroscience, finance, and climate, identifiability leads to more trustworthy interpretability analysis, which is crucial for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: This paper examines the integration of AI systems in economic settings using a principal-agent model and proposes an incentive mechanism for optimal social welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of AI systems operating in economic environments where data, behavior, incentives, and learning are influenced by the agents' interactions.

Method: The authors utilize a principal-agent interaction in a Markov decision process with strategic externalities, proposing a two-phase incentive mechanism to optimize long-term welfare.

Result: The mechanism achieves sublinear social-welfare regret under conditions of rationality and exploration, showcasing its ability to correct inefficient learning dynamics.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of incentive-aware design for ensuring safe and welfare-aligned AI systems in complex environments like markets and insurance.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly operate inside markets and institutions where data, behavior, and incentives are endogenous. This paper develops an economic foundation for multi-agent learning by studying a principal-agent interaction in a Markov decision process with strategic externalities, where both the principal and the agent learn over time. We propose a two-phase incentive mechanism that first estimates implementable transfers and then uses them to steer long-run dynamics; under mild regret-based rationality and exploration conditions, the mechanism achieves sublinear social-welfare regret and thus asymptotically optimal welfare. Simulations illustrate how even coarse incentives can correct inefficient learning under stateful externalities, highlighting the necessity of incentive-aware design for safe and welfare-aligned AI in markets and insurance.

*Vladimir Braverman,Sumegha Garg,Chen Wang,David P. Woodruff,Samson Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the experts and bandit problem in the sliding window and data streaming models, achieving near-optimal regret with low memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is inspired by challenges in the streaming model's experts problem and aims to optimize performance in the sliding window and bandit models, which are critical for applications like traffic monitoring and trading.

Method: The authors introduce algorithms that achieve regret bounds using limited queries (e.g., 2 queries for sliding window and 1 for bandit) and polylogarithmic memory.

Result: They achieve near-optimal regret bounds of $\sqrt{nW}\text{polylog}(nT)$ over sliding windows and $nT^{2/3}\text{polylog}(T)$ for bandit problems, with significant memory efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: The algorithms develop optimal regret outcomes within sliding windows and streaming models while significantly reducing memory usage, marking a breakthrough for both settings.

Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the experts problem in the streaming model, we consider the experts problem in the sliding window model. The sliding window model is a well-studied model that captures applications such as traffic monitoring, epidemic tracking, and automated trading, where recent information is more valuable than older data. Formally, we have $n$ experts, $T$ days, the ability to query the predictions of $q$ experts on each day, a limited amount of memory, and should achieve the (near-)optimal regret $\sqrt{nW}\text{polylog}(nT)$ regret over any window of the last $W$ days. While it is impossible to achieve such regret with $1$ query, we show that with $2$ queries we can achieve such regret and with only $\text{polylog}(nT)$ bits of memory. Not only are our algorithms optimal for sliding windows, but we also show for every interval $\mathcal{I}$ of days that we achieve $\sqrt{n|\mathcal{I}|}\text{polylog}(nT)$ regret with $2$ queries and only $\text{polylog}(nT)$ bits of memory, providing an exponential improvement on the memory of previous interval regret algorithms. Building upon these techniques, we address the bandit problem in data streams, where $q=1$, achieving $n T^{2/3}\text{polylog}(T)$ regret with $\text{polylog}(nT)$ memory, which is the first sublinear regret in the streaming model in the bandit setting with polylogarithmic memory; this can be further improved to the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret if the best expert's losses are in a random order.

### [344] [A Theoretical and Empirical Taxonomy of Imbalance in Binary Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04149)
*Rose Yvette Bandolo Essomba,Ernest Fokoué*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze class imbalance effects on classification performance using fundamental scales $(η, κ, Δ)$ and shows theoretical and empirical alignment of these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance impacts classification performance, and a unified theoretical understanding of this effect was lacking.

Method: The authors derived closed-form Bayes errors for a Gaussian Bayes classifier and analyzed how imbalance influences classification boundaries. Empirical verification was conducted using genomic datasets by varying $η$ while keeping $κ$ and $Δ$ fixed.

Result: Class imbalance causes predictable patterns of classifier performance degradation aligned with theoretical expectations across regimes. Minority Recall declines severely, Precision shifts asymmetrically, and overall metrics show deterioration.

Conclusion: The framework $(η, κ, Δ)$ effectively explains how class imbalance deteriorates classification, providing theoretical predictions that align consistently with empirical results.

Abstract: Class imbalance significantly degrades classification performance, yet its effects are rarely analyzed from a unified theoretical perspective. We propose a principled framework based on three fundamental scales: the imbalance coefficient $η$, the sample--dimension ratio $κ$, and the intrinsic separability $Δ$. Starting from the Gaussian Bayes classifier, we derive closed-form Bayes errors and show how imbalance shifts the discriminant boundary, yielding a deterioration slope that predicts four regimes: Normal, Mild, Extreme, and Catastrophic. Using a balanced high-dimensional genomic dataset, we vary only $η$ while keeping $κ$ and $Δ$ fixed. Across parametric and non-parametric models, empirical degradation closely follows theoretical predictions: minority Recall collapses once $\log(η)$ exceeds $Δ\sqrtκ$, Precision increases asymmetrically, and F1-score and PR-AUC decline in line with the predicted regimes. These results show that the triplet $(η,κ,Δ)$ provides a model-agnostic, geometrically grounded explanation of imbalance-induced deterioration.

*Justin C. Dunlap,Anne-Simone Parent,Ralf Widenhorn*

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to challenges, focusing on detecting sycophantic or stubborn behaviors. Using fictitious-response rebuttals, the framework assesses behavioral tendencies across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM behavior during user interactions, especially when responding to disagreements, is crucial for assessing their reliability and behavioral nuances. Current evaluations lack systematic tools for measuring such dynamics.

Method: The authors use a fictitious-response rebuttal technique, presenting LLMs with multiple-choice questions followed by deliberate challenges. They develop indices to measure sycophancy (excessive agreement) and stubbornness (unwillingness to revise previous answers).

Result: Results indicate measurable behavioral differences across OpenAI model generations, with newer models and those with enhanced reasoning abilities showing reduced sycophantic tendencies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and indices provide a generalizable and practical tool for systematically studying LLM dialogue behaviors, which can help compare models and improve their interaction quality.

Abstract: We present a systematic framework of indices designed to characterize Large Language Model (LLM) responses when challenged with rebuttals during a chat. Assessing how LLMs respond to user dissent is crucial for understanding their reliability and behavior patterns, yet the complexity of human-LLM interactions makes systematic evaluation challenging. Our approach employs a fictitious-response rebuttal method that quantifies LLM behavior when presented with multiple-choice questions followed by deliberate challenges to their fictitious previous response. The indices are specifically designed to detect and measure what could be characterized as sycophantic behavior (excessive agreement with user challenges) or stubborn responses (rigid adherence to the fictitious response in the chat history) from LLMs. These metrics allow investigation of the relationships between sycophancy, stubbornness, and the model's actual mastery of the subject matter. We demonstrate the utility of these indices using two physics problems as test scenarios with various OpenAI models. The framework is intentionally generalizable to any multiple-choice format question, including on topics without universally accepted correct answers. Our results reveal measurable differences across OpenAI model generations, with trends indicating that newer models and those employing greater "Reasoning Effort" exhibit reduced sycophantic behavior. The FR pairing method combined with our proposed indices provides a practical, adaptable toolkit for systematically comparing LLM dialogue behaviors across different models and contexts.

*Gaspar Roy,Eugeni Belda,Baptiste Hennecart,Yann Chevaleyre,Edi Prifti,Jean-Daniel Zucker*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: MetagenBERT introduces a Transformer-based model leveraging raw DNA sequences for metagenomic disease prediction, outperforming traditional species-based approaches in several cases and enabling efficient, annotation-free representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metagenomic disease prediction relies on incomplete species abundance tables, which lose valuable information in raw DNA reads.

Method: MetagenBERT uses Transformer-based genomic language models (DNABERT2 and DNABERTMS) to embed raw DNA reads and aggregates them with FAISS-accelerated KMeans clustering, producing cluster abundance vectors for metagenomic representation.

Result: MetagenBERT achieves competitive or better AUC performance compared to species-based baselines, shows complementary predictive power with traditional methods, and maintains robustness at reduced reads with significant computational gains.

Conclusion: MetagenBERT demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, annotation-free metagenomic representation, paving the way for generalizable phenotype-aware models across diverse datasets and platforms.

Abstract: Metagenomic disease prediction commonly relies on species abundance tables derived from large, incomplete reference catalogs, constraining resolution and discarding valuable information contained in DNA reads. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MetagenBERT, a Transformer based framework that produces end to end metagenome embeddings directly from raw DNA sequences, without taxonomic or functional annotations. Reads are embedded using foundational genomic language models (DNABERT2 and the microbiome specialized DNABERTMS), then aggregated through a scalable clustering strategy based on FAISS accelerated KMeans. Each metagenome is represented as a cluster abundance vector summarizing the distribution of its embedded reads. We evaluate this approach on five benchmark gut microbiome datasets (Cirrhosis, T2D, Obesity, IBD, CRC). MetagenBERT achieves competitive or superior AUC performance relative to species abundance baselines across most tasks. Concatenating both representations further improves prediction, demonstrating complementarity between taxonomic and embedding derived signals. Clustering remains robust when applied to as little as 10% of reads, highlighting substantial redundancy in metagenomes and enabling major computational gains. We additionally introduce MetagenBERT Glob Mcardis, a cross cohort variant trained on the large, phenotypically diverse MetaCardis cohort and transferred to other datasets, retaining predictive signal including for unseen phenotypes, indicating the feasibility of a foundation model for metagenome representation. Robustness analyses (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP, entropy) show consistent separation of different states across subsamples. Overall, MetagenBERT provides a scalable, annotation free representation of metagenomes pointing toward future phenotype aware generalization across heterogeneous cohorts and sequencing technologies.

Motivation: The paper addresses the growing demand for cost-effective and efficient strategies for replicating market index performance.

Method: The study categorizes index tracking models into three main frameworks and conducts a comprehensive empirical analysis using the S&P 500 dataset.

Result: The study finds that different approaches excel in specific aspects, such as optimization-based models for precision, statistical models for return-risk balance, and machine learning models for low turnover and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: By critically reviewing existing strategies and presenting empirical comparisons, the paper offers valuable insights for investors and fund managers on index tracking innovations.

Abstract: Index tracking, also known as passive investing, has gained significant traction in financial markets due to its cost-effective and efficient approach to replicating the performance of a specific market index. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and strategies developed for index tracking, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. We categorize the index tracking models into three broad frameworks: optimization-based models, statistical-based models and machine learning based data-driven approach. A comprehensive empirical study conducted on the S\&P 500 dataset demonstrates that the tracking error volatility model under the optimization-based framework delivers the most precise index tracking, the convex co-integration model, under the statistical-based framework achieves the strongest return-risk balance, and the deep neural network with fixed noise model within the data-driven framework provides a competitive performance with notably low turnover and high computational efficiency. By combining a critical review of the existing literature with comparative empirical analysis, this paper aims to provide insights into the evolving landscape of index tracking and its practical implications for investors and fund managers.

*Fabian Stephany,Jedrzej Duszynski*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper examines gender disparities in the adoption of Generative AI in the UK, finding that women are less likely to adopt due to differing societal risk concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore why GenAI adoption is unequal, particularly among women, and identify the societal risk perceptions influencing this disparity.

Method: The authors use nationally representative UK survey data from 2023–2024, constructing a societal risk perception index and employing intersectional analyses and synthetic twin panel design.

Result: The index explains 9–18% of GenAI adoption variation, showing large gender disparities, especially among digitally fluent young individuals. Optimism about AI’s societal impact significantly increases adoption among young women.

Conclusion: Gendered societal risk perceptions, not access or capability, drive unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill development, and economic inequality in an AI-driven economy.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is diffusing rapidly, yet its adoption is strikingly unequal. Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.

Result: The method is validated using real binding affinity measurements rather than proxy values, demonstrating its potential for reliable application in phage display experiments.

Conclusion: Understanding experimental noise and incorporating model uncertainty can enhance the interpretation and reliability of protein design methods using phage display data.

Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from 'held-out' phage display rounds.

### [350] [Physically Consistent Machine Learning for Melting Temperature Prediction of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03801)
*Mohd Hasnain*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A machine learning model is developed to predict the melting temperature of high-entropy alloys, achieving high accuracy and capturing fundamental metallurgical trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods to predict the melting temperature of complex alloys are computationally expensive; this study aims to provide a more efficient alternative.

Method: An XGBoost machine learning model is employed, excluding temperature-dependent descriptors, and optimized for physical consistency using elemental properties.

Result: The model shows excellent predictive performance with R2 = 0.948 and MSE = 9928, successfully capturing phase stability trends based on valence electron concentration.

Conclusion: Data-driven approaches with proper feature engineering can efficiently and accurately predict alloy properties and reveal metallurgical principles.

Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.

### [351] [Discriminating real and synthetic super-resolved audio samples using embedding-based classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03443)
*Mikhail Silaev,Konstantinos Drossos,Tuomas Virtanen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study evaluates the gap between generated high-quality audio from ADSR models and real audio using embedding-based classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of analysis on how closely synthetic super-resolved audio matches the distribution of real wideband audio.

Method: The authors trained linear classifiers in embedding spaces to distinguish real wideband audio from synthetic super-resolved samples using multiple audio embeddings.

Result: The classifiers achieved near-perfect separation between real and synthetic audio, exposing distributional differences despite high perceptual quality in generated audio.

Conclusion: While ADSR models deliver impressive perceptual quality, a persistent gap exists in true distributional fidelity to real audio, even with advanced methods like diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in audio super-resolution (ADSR), producing perceptually convincing wideband audio from narrowband inputs. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on signal-level or perceptual metrics, leaving open the question of how closely the distributions of synthetic super-resolved and real wideband audio match. Here we address this problem by analyzing the separability of real and super-resolved audio in various embedding spaces. We consider both middle-band ($4\to 16$~kHz) and full-band ($16\to 48$~kHz) upsampling tasks for speech and music, training linear classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic samples based on multiple types of audio embeddings. Comparisons with objective metrics and subjective listening tests reveal that embedding-based classifiers achieve near-perfect separation, even when the generated audio attains high perceptual quality and state-of-the-art metric scores. This behavior is consistent across datasets and models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, highlighting a persistent gap between perceptual quality and true distributional fidelity in ADSR models.

### [352] [ReStyle-TTS: Relative and Continuous Style Control for Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03632)
*Haitao Li,Chunxiang Jin,Chenglin Li,Wenhao Guan,Zhengxing Huang,Xie Chen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReStyle-TTS, a model improving upon zero-shot text-to-speech to enable continuous and reference-relative style control, overcoming limitations of current TTS systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot TTS models excessively rely on reference audio's speaking style, making it hard to synthesize desired styles when references are limited or mismatched.

Method: The method combines Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG) to independently manage reference and text reliance, style-specific LoRAs with Orthogonal LoRA Fusion for continuous multi-attribute control, and a Timbre Consistency Optimization module to stabilize timbre.

Result: ReStyle-TTS shows enhanced usability with continuous and relative control over attributes like pitch, energy, and emotions while maintaining intelligibility and speaker timbre in challenging style scenarios.

Conclusion: ReStyle-TTS successfully addresses style control challenges in zero-shot TTS, offering improved user flexibility and performance in mismatched style cases.

Abstract: Zero-shot text-to-speech models can clone a speaker's timbre from a short reference audio, but they also strongly inherit the speaking style present in the reference. As a result, synthesizing speech with a desired style often requires carefully selecting reference audio, which is impractical when only limited or mismatched references are available. While recent controllable TTS methods attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on absolute style targets and discrete textual prompts, and therefore do not support continuous and reference-relative style control. We propose ReStyle-TTS, a framework that enables continuous and reference-relative style control in zero-shot TTS. Our key insight is that effective style control requires first reducing the model's implicit dependence on reference style before introducing explicit control mechanisms. To this end, we introduce Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), which independently controls text and reference guidance, reducing reliance on reference style while preserving text fidelity. On top of this, we apply style-specific LoRAs together with Orthogonal LoRA Fusion to enable continuous and disentangled multi-attribute control, and introduce a Timbre Consistency Optimization module to mitigate timbre drift caused by weakened reference guidance. Experiments show that ReStyle-TTS enables user-friendly, continuous, and relative control over pitch, energy, and multiple emotions while maintaining intelligibility and speaker timbre, and performs robustly in challenging mismatched reference-target style scenarios.

*Parampreet Singh,Akshay Raina,Sayeedul Islam Sheikh,Vipul Arora*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper investigates using label propagation, a semi-supervised learning technique, to efficiently and automatically label large audio datasets for Indian Art Music tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The creation of large annotated datasets in audio and music domains is challenging as it requires significant resources, effort, and domain expertise. This research addresses the gap by exploring methods to minimize manual labeling efforts.

Method: The authors use label propagation, a graph-based semi-supervised learning technique, for generating annotations. They construct a similarity graph from audio embeddings, propagating limited annotations to unlabeled data in a transductive manner.

Result: The study applied the method to Raga identification and Instrument classification using Indian Art Music datasets. It showed that label propagation significantly reduces the effort required for labeling and outperforms traditional baseline methods, including pretrained models.

Conclusion: Graph-based semi-supervised learning, like label propagation, holds promise in democratizing data annotation and driving advancements in music information retrieval fields.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning frameworks rely on extensive labeled datasets for robust performance on real-world tasks. However, there is a lack of large annotated datasets in audio and music domains, as annotating such recordings is resource-intensive, laborious, and often require expert domain knowledge. In this work, we explore the use of label propagation (LP), a graph-based semi-supervised learning technique, for automatically labeling the unlabeled set in an unsupervised manner. By constructing a similarity graph over audio embeddings, we propagate limited label information from a small annotated subset to a larger unlabeled corpus in a transductive, semi-supervised setting. We apply this method to two tasks in Indian Art Music (IAM): Raga identification and Instrument classification. For both these tasks, we integrate multiple public datasets along with additional recordings we acquire from Prasar Bharati Archives to perform LP. Our experiments demonstrate that LP significantly reduces labeling overhead and produces higher-quality annotations compared to conventional baseline methods, including those based on pretrained inductive models. These results highlight the potential of graph-based semi-supervised learning to democratize data annotation and accelerate progress in music information retrieval.

*Pablo Thomassin,Guillaume Guerard,Sonia Djebali,Vincent Marc Lambert*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum model for portfolio optimization that embeds slack variables directly into the Hamiltonian to resolve constraint encoding challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of effectively encoding inequality constraints in quantum algorithms for financial optimization.

Method: Introduces a slack-ancilla scheme by mapping slack variables to ancilla qubits and transforming the problem into a QUBO suitable for QAOA, while internalizing constraints within the energy landscape.

Result: The empirical simulation shows the quantum model finds the optimal portfolio consistently, outperforming standard penalty-based QAOA.

Conclusion: The slack-ancilla modification of Hamiltonian architecture provides a robust solution to constrained optimization on quantum computers, introducing a quantum limit on the portfolio tradeoff.

Abstract: Effectively encoding inequality constraints is a primary obstacle in applying quantum algorithms to financial optimization. A quantum model for Markowitz portfolio optimization is presented that resolves this by embedding slack variables directly into the problem Hamiltonian. The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited.

### [356] [Provably Convergent Decentralized Optimization over Directed Graphs under Generalized Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03566)
*Yanan Bo,Yongqiang Wang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized optimization framework that accommodates rapidly varying gradients using generalized smoothness and gradient clipping techniques, achieving improved stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized optimization methods fail in scenarios with rapidly varying gradients as they depend on classical Lipschitz smoothness assumptions.

Method: The approach integrates gradient-tracking with gradient clipping under a generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness framework, ensuring convergence on directed communication graphs without requiring bounded gradient dissimilarity assumptions.

Result: The framework successfully handles unbounded gradient dissimilarity, is applicable to heterogeneous data environments, and demonstrates superior performance through experiments on LIBSVM and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a robust decentralized optimization method compatible with realistic large-scale settings, overcoming limitations of prior methods and showing fast, stable convergence.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become a fundamental tool for large-scale learning systems; however, most existing methods rely on the classical Lipschitz smoothness assumption, which is often violated in problems with rapidly varying gradients. Motivated by this limitation, we study decentralized optimization under the generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness framework, in which the Hessian norm is allowed to grow linearly with the gradient norm, thereby accommodating rapidly varying gradients beyond classical Lipschitz smoothness. We integrate gradient-tracking techniques with gradient clipping and carefully design the clipping threshold to ensure accurate convergence over directed communication graphs under generalized smoothness. In contrast to existing distributed optimization results under generalized smoothness that require a bounded gradient dissimilarity assumption, our results remain valid even when the gradient dissimilarity is unbounded, making the proposed framework more applicable to realistic heterogeneous data environments. We validate our approach via numerical experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including LIBSVM and CIFAR-10, using regularized logistic regression and convolutional neural networks, demonstrating superior stability and faster convergence over existing methods.

*Valentine Olanubi,Phineas Agar,Brendan Ames*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper focuses on solving the densest submatrix problem in binary matrices, providing generalized conditions for recovery in challenging settings with multiple dense submatrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the densest submatrix problem in scenarios involving many dense submatrices, as opposed to prior works focused on single dense submatrices hidden by noise.

Method: The authors establish sufficient conditions for polynomial time solutions under stochastic block models and adversarial settings, supported by empirical experiments and numerical validation.

Result: The paper proves theoretical phase-transitions for perfect recovery and demonstrates these findings through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study extends convex relaxation methods to more realistic and complex scenarios, contributing broader applicability to the densest submatrix problem in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: We consider the densest submatrix problem, which seeks the submatrix of fixed size of a given binary matrix that contains the most nonzero entries. This problem is a natural generalization of fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization, e.g., the densest subgraph, maximum clique, and maximum edge biclique problems, and has wide application the study of complex networks. Much recent research has focused on the development of sufficient conditions for exact solution of the densest submatrix problem via convex relaxation. The vast majority of these sufficient conditions establish identification of the densest submatrix within a graph containing exactly one large dense submatrix hidden by noise. The assumptions of these underlying models are not observed in real-world networks, where the data may correspond to a matrix containing many dense submatrices of varying sizes.
  We extend and generalize these results to the more realistic setting where the input matrix may contain \emph{many} large dense subgraphs. Specifically, we establish sufficient conditions under which we can expect to solve the densest submatrix problem in polynomial time for random input matrices sampled from a generalization of the stochastic block model. Moreover, we also provide sufficient conditions for perfect recovery under a deterministic adversarial. Numerical experiments involving randomly generated problem instances and real-world collaboration and communication networks are used empirically to verify the theoretical phase-transitions to perfect recovery given by these sufficient conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for optimal control in obstacle problems face challenges due to their nonsmoothness, nonlinearity, and computational cost, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: A mesh-free approach using constraint-embedding neural networks and the Single-Loop Stochastic First-Order Bilevel Algorithm (S2-FOBA) for optimization, avoiding nested computations and restrictive assumptions.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and significantly reduces computational costs compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient and scalable solution for optimal control problems in complex domains, leveraging deep learning and advanced optimization techniques.

Abstract: Optimal control of obstacle problems arises in a wide range of applications and is computationally challenging due to its nonsmoothness, nonlinearity, and bilevel structure. Classical numerical approaches rely on mesh-based discretization and typically require solving a sequence of costly subproblems. In this work, we propose a single-loop bilevel deep learning method, which is mesh-free, scalable to high-dimensional and complex domains, and avoids repeated solution of discretized subproblems. The method employs constraint-embedding neural networks to approximate the state and control and preserves the bilevel structure. To train the neural networks efficiently, we propose a Single-Loop Stochastic First-Order Bilevel Algorithm (S2-FOBA), which eliminates nested optimization and does not rely on restrictive lower-level uniqueness assumptions. We analyze the convergence behavior of S2-FOBA under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments on benchmark examples, including distributed and obstacle control problems with regular and irregular obstacles on complex domains, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to classical numerical methods.

*Yuyang Fu,Xiuzhen Guo,Ji Shi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation in noisy annotations, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise in medical image segmentation due to noisy annotations caused by organ complexities and annotator inconsistencies.

Method: It employs staged reinforcement learning, voxel-level actor-critic modules, and dynamic strategies to refine noisy annotations autonomously.

Result: Experiments demonstrate State-of-The-Art performance with over 3% improvement in Dice and IoU scores across three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SVL-DRL framework effectively mitigates annotation noise and enhances segmentation efficiency without manual correction.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes adapting pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models for diverse image restoration tasks using LoRA adapters with limited paired examples, guided by text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image restoration methods rely on training specialized models with thousands of examples for each specific degradation type, which is resource-intensive.

Method: The authors fine-tune LoRA adapters on a large pre-trained model, FLUX.1 Kontext, using 16-128 paired images per task and text prompts specifying restoration operations, optimizing for perceptual quality.

Result: The method successfully handles multiple restoration tasks such as denoising, deraining, and dehazing through unified adapters, significantly reducing data requirements while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: Pre-trained image editing models, when adapted efficiently, are compelling alternatives for image restoration tasks, enabling few-shot data-efficient solutions with high perceptual quality.

Abstract: Image restoration has traditionally required training specialized models on thousands of paired examples per degradation type. We challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that powerful pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models can be efficiently adapted for multiple restoration tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with remarkably few examples. Our approach fine-tunes LoRA adapters on FLUX.1 Kontext, a state-of-the-art 12B parameter flow matching model for image-to-image translation, using only 16-128 paired images per task, guided by simple text prompts that specify the restoration operation. Unlike existing methods that train specialized restoration networks from scratch with thousands of samples, we leverage the rich visual priors already encoded in large-scale pre-trained editing models, dramatically reducing data requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. A single unified LoRA adapter, conditioned on task-specific text prompts, effectively handles multiple degradations including denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze: (i) the impact of training set size on restoration quality, (ii) trade-offs between task-specific versus unified multi-task adapters, (iii) the role of text encoder fine-tuning, and (iv) zero-shot baseline performance. While our method prioritizes perceptual quality over pixel-perfect reconstruction metrics like PSNR/SSIM, our results demonstrate that pre-trained image editing models, when properly adapted, offer a compelling and data-efficient alternative to traditional image restoration approaches, opening new avenues for few-shot, prompt-guided image enhancement.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoDiff-SAR, utilizing geometric priors and advanced fusion methods for high-quality SAR image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods in SAR imaging fail to incorporate explicit geometric information, leading to substandard image generation and limited control over parameters like azimuth angles.

Method: Introduces GeoDiff-SAR, which incorporates SAR point clouds for geometric guidance, uses a feature fusion gating network for multimodal information fusion, and fine-tunes the Stable Diffusion 3.5 model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: Experiments show GeoDiff-SAR achieves high-fidelity SAR image generation and improves downstream classification accuracy, especially across varying azimuth angles.

Conclusion: GeoDiff-SAR's integration of physical guidance and advanced generative techniques enhances SAR generation and classification, particularly in handling geometric variations.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging results are highly sensitive to observation geometries and the geometric parameters of targets. However, existing generative methods primarily operate within the image domain, neglecting explicit geometric information. This limitation often leads to unsatisfactory generation quality and the inability to precisely control critical parameters such as azimuth angles. To address these challenges, we propose GeoDiff-SAR, a geometric prior guided diffusion model for high-fidelity SAR image generation. Specifically, GeoDiff-SAR first efficiently simulates the geometric structures and scattering relationships inherent in real SAR imaging by calculating SAR point clouds at specific azimuths, which serves as a robust physical guidance. Secondly, to effectively fuse multi-modal information, we employ a feature fusion gating network based on Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to dynamically regulate the weight distribution of 3D physical information, image control parameters, and textual description parameters. Thirdly, we utilize the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) architecture to perform lightweight fine-tuning on the advanced Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5) model, enabling it to rapidly adapt to the distribution characteristics of the SAR domain. To validate the effectiveness of GeoDiff-SAR, extensive comparative experiments were conducted on real-world SAR datasets. The results demonstrate that data generated by GeoDiff-SAR exhibits high fidelity and effectively enhances the accuracy of downstream classification tasks. In particular, it significantly improves recognition performance across different azimuth angles, thereby underscoring the superiority of physics-guided generation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents a low-complexity neural network for depth-guided image deblurring, leveraging wavelet transforms and depth map integration for efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of image deblurring remains challenging due to its ill-posed nature, and existing deep learning solutions, while effective, are computationally expensive and impractical for non-server environments. The integration of depth information from mobile Lidars provides an opportunity to enhance deblurring quality efficiently.

Method: The proposed method employs the wavelet transform to handle structural details and reduce spatial redundancy, combined with efficient feature conditioning on depth maps to enhance the deblurring process.

Result: The approach demonstrates competitive image quality compared to state-of-the-art models while achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in computational complexity.

Conclusion: The study reveals that wavelet-based architectural changes and depth-guided conditioning are crucial for achieving an effective and lightweight deblurring model suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Image deblurring is a challenging problem in imaging due to its highly ill-posed nature. Deep learning models have shown great success in tackling this problem but the quest for the best image quality has brought their computational complexity up, making them impractical on anything but powerful servers. Meanwhile, recent works have shown that mobile Lidars can provide complementary information in the form of depth maps that enhance deblurring quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-complexity neural network for depth-guided image deblurring. We show that the use of the wavelet transform to separate structural details and reduce spatial redundancy as well as efficient feature conditioning on the depth information are essential ingredients in developing a low-complexity model. Experimental results show competitive image quality against recent state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity by up to two orders of magnitude.

### [363] [Scanner-Induced Domain Shifts Undermine the Robustness of Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04163)
*Erik Thiringer,Fredrik K. Gustafsson,Kajsa Ledesma Eriksson,Mattias Rantalainen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of 14 Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) to scanner-induced variability and highlights that current models are sensitive to domain shifts caused by different scanning devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of PFMs in realistic clinical scenarios, especially focusing on how different scanner devices impact the embeddings and predictions of these models.

Method: The authors systematically analyzed 14 PFMs on a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, isolating scanner effects. They assessed robustness through embedding analyses and supervised prediction tasks.

Result: None of the evaluated PFMs demonstrated reliable robustness to scanner-induced domain shifts. Scanner-specific variability significantly impacted embedding spaces and calibration of predictions, indicating a potential bias in clinical applications.

Conclusion: Current PFMs are not invariant to scanner variability, and their robustness cannot be ensured just by increasing training data, model size, or recency. Explicit evaluation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic variability is necessary for PFMs' development and evaluation.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have become central to computational pathology, aiming to offer general encoders for feature extraction from whole-slide images (WSIs). Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GesFi is a WiFi-based gesture recognition system that uses latent domain mining and adversarial learning to improve cross-domain generalization for gesture recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and generalizable gesture recognition across diverse and changing environments using WiFi signals.

Method: GesFi processes WiFi data using CSI-ratio denoising, FFT, and visualization techniques, applies adversarial learning for gesture semantics suppression, and uses unsupervised clustering to uncover latent domain shifts. It aligns these domains through adversarial learning for robust generalization.

Result: GesFi demonstrated significant performance improvements of up to 78% and 50% over state-of-the-art adversarial methods and outperformed other generalization approaches in cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes GesFi as an effective and generalizable WiFi-based gesture recognition system that works in varied real-world and cross-domain settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose GesFi, a novel WiFi-based gesture recognition system that introduces WiFi latent domain mining to redefine domains directly from the data itself. GesFi first processes raw sensing data collected from WiFi receivers using CSI-ratio denoising, Short-Time Fast Fourier Transform, and visualization techniques to generate standardized input representations. It then employs class-wise adversarial learning to suppress gesture semantic and leverages unsupervised clustering to automatically uncover latent domain factors responsible for distributional shifts. These latent domains are then aligned through adversarial learning to support robust cross-domain generalization. Finally, the system is applied to the target environment for robust gesture inference. We deployed GesFi under both single-pair and multi-pair settings using commodity WiFi transceivers, and evaluated it across multiple public datasets and real-world environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, GesFi achieves up to 78% and 50% performance improvements over existing adversarial methods, and consistently outperforms prior generalization approaches across most cross-domain tasks.

*Gabin Taibi,Joerg Osterrieder*

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: This paper presents an algorithmic framework to improve literature review processes using NLP and clustering techniques, applied to financial narratives in economics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Literature reviews are often time-consuming and lack efficiency and reproducibility. This paper aims to address these issues with an algorithmic solution.

Method: Combining NLP, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools, the framework automates literature selection and analysis. A case study involving financial narratives is used.

Result: The study reveals fragmented approaches in modeling financial narratives while illustrating the effectiveness of the algorithmic SLR methodology.

Conclusion: The framework enhances literature review efficiency and advocates for unified, rigorous methods in narrative modeling.

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithmic framework for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLRs), designed to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and selection quality assessment in the literature review process. The proposed method integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools to automate and structure the selection and analysis of academic publications. The framework is applied to a case study focused on financial narratives, an emerging area in financial economics that examines how structured accounts of economic events, formed by the convergence of individual interpretations, influence market dynamics and asset prices. Drawing from the Scopus database of peer-reviewed literature, the review highlights research efforts to model financial narratives using various NLP techniques. Results reveal that while advances have been made, the conceptualization of financial narratives remains fragmented, often reduced to sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or their combination, without a unified theoretical framework. The findings underscore the value of more rigorous and dynamic narrative modeling approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic SLR methodology.

### [366] [An Algebraic Representation Theorem for Linear GENEOs in Geometric Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03910)
*Francesco Conti,Patrizio Frosini,Nicola Quercioli*

Main category: math.RT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs to work between heterogeneous data spaces, enhancing their applicability in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing GENEOs that only work on linear operators of the same data type, broadening their utility in real-world machine learning applications.

Method: The authors propose a new representation theorem based on generalized T-permutant measures, providing a complete characterization of linear GENEOs between different data spaces.

Result: The paper proves the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs while illustrating their practical benefits in improving autoencoder performance.

Conclusion: This work extends the theoretical foundations of GENEOs, enhancing their relevance in Geometric and Topological Deep Learning by enabling practical applications in diverse data spaces.

Abstract: Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.

### [367] [Automated Post-Incident Policy Gap Analysis via Threat-Informed Evidence Mapping using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03287)
*Huan Lin Oh,Jay Yong Jun Jie,Mandy Lee Ling Siu,Jonathan Pan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline cybersecurity post-incident reviews by autonomously analyzing evidence and identifying policy gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-incident reviews rely heavily on labor-intensive expert analysis, and this paper seeks to automate and improve these workflows using advanced AI models.

Method: The framework uses log data mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for policy retrieval in a simulated brute-force attack scenario.

Result: The proposed pipeline successfully interprets log evidence, identifies policy deficiencies, and provides actionable recommendations while ensuring traceability between evidence and policies.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted frameworks demonstrate the potential to enhance efficiency and consistency in post-incident reviews but emphasize that human oversight remains critical in decision-making.

Abstract: Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making.

### [368] [AgentMark: Utility-Preserving Behavioral Watermarking for Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03294)
*Kaibo Huang,Jin Tan,Yukun Wei,Wanling Li,Zipei Zhang,Hui Tian,Zhongliang Yang,Linna Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AgentMark is a framework for embedding multi-bit identifiers into the planning decisions of LLM-based agents to address IP and regulatory provenance challenges, while preserving their utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to protect intellectual property (IP) and ensure regulatory provenance for LLM-based agents has grown, as current methods like content watermarking are insufficient for identifying complex planning behaviors in multi-step tasks.

Method: AgentMark encodes behavioral watermarks by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling. It is compatible with existing content watermarking and works under black-box API constraints.

Result: Experiments confirm AgentMark's practical utility, showing effective multi-bit capacity, robustness in partial log recovery, and negligible impact on agent utility across various environments.

Conclusion: AgentMark successfully addresses the challenges of behavioral watermarking in black-box LLM agents, offering a practical and robust solution for ensuring provenance and IP protection in agent planning decisions.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed to autonomously solve complex tasks, raising urgent needs for IP protection and regulatory provenance. While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation. The code is available at https://github.com/Tooooa/AgentMark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Listen to Rhythm, Choose Movements (LRCM), a multimodal-guided diffusion framework for dance motion generation enhancing semantic control and sequence coherence while supporting various input modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dance motion generation methods struggle with coarse semantic control and lack coherence in long-duration sequences, motivating the development of a new solution.

Method: The approach employs a diffusion framework with a feature decoupling paradigm, using a Conformer-based architecture and Motion Temporal Mamba Module for smooth autoregressive motion synthesis.

Result: LRCM achieves strong functional and quantitative performance in multimodal input scenarios and long sequence generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates great potential in generating coherent dance motions with diverse inputs and long-term dynamics, and its tools will be made publicly available after acceptance.

Abstract: Advances in generative models and sequence learning have greatly promoted research in dance motion generation, yet current methods still suffer from coarse semantic control and poor coherence in long sequences. In this work, we present Listen to Rhythm, Choose Movements (LRCM), a multimodal-guided diffusion framework supporting both diverse input modalities and autoregressive dance motion generation. We explore a feature decoupling paradigm for dance datasets and generalize it to the Motorica Dance dataset, separating motion capture data, audio rhythm, and professionally annotated global and local text descriptions. Our diffusion architecture integrates an audio-latent Conformer and a text-latent Cross-Conformer, and incorporates a Motion Temporal Mamba Module (MTMM) to enable smooth, long-duration autoregressive synthesis. Experimental results indicate that LRCM delivers strong performance in both functional capability and quantitative metrics, demonstrating notable potential in multimodal input scenarios and extended sequence generation. We will release the full codebase, dataset, and pretrained models publicly upon acceptance.

### [371] [TRYLOCK: Defense-in-Depth Against LLM Jailbreaks via Layered Preference and Representation Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03300)
*Scott Thornton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRYLOCK proposes a multi-layered defense to tackle jailbreak attacks on large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks bypass model safety layers, exploiting vulnerabilities and urgently require better defensive mechanisms.

Method: TRYLOCK integrates four mechanisms: safety alignment (DPO), activation control (RepE), adaptive steering (sidecar classifier), and input canonicalization.

Result: TRYLOCK reduced attack success rates by 88%, provided unique mechanism effectiveness insights, and balanced security with usability.

Conclusion: The study highlights how diverse mechanisms can synergize to enhance model safety and usability without a notable trade-off.

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and single-layer defenses often trade security for usability. We present TRYLOCK, the first defense-in-depth architecture that combines four heterogeneous mechanisms across the inference stack: weight-level safety alignment via DPO, activation-level control via Representation Engineering (RepE) steering, adaptive steering strength selected by a lightweight sidecar classifier, and input canonicalization to neutralize encoding-based bypasses. On Mistral-7B-Instruct evaluated against a 249-prompt attack set spanning five attack families, TRYLOCK achieves 88.0% relative ASR reduction (46.5% to 5.6%), with each layer contributing unique coverage: RepE blocks 36% of attacks that bypass DPO alone, while canonicalization catches 14% of encoding attacks that evade both. We discover a non-monotonic steering phenomenon -- intermediate strength (alpha=1.0) degrades safety below baseline -- and provide mechanistic hypotheses explaining RepE-DPO interference. The adaptive sidecar reduces over-refusal from 60% to 48% while maintaining identical attack defense, demonstrating that security and usability need not be mutually exclusive. We release all components -- trained adapters, steering vectors, sidecar classifier, preference pairs, and complete evaluation methodology -- enabling full reproducibility.

### [372] [DeepLeak: Privacy Enhancing Hardening of Model Explanations Against Membership Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03429)
*Firas Ben Hmida,Zain Sbeih,Philemon Hailemariam,Birhanu Eshete*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepLeak, a framework to audit and mitigate privacy risks in ML explanation methods while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension between the need for ML explainability and privacy in high-stakes applications like diagnostics and loan decisions.

Method: DeepLeak implements a stronger membership inference attack, proposes model-agnostic mitigation techniques, and conducts root-cause analysis to identify algorithmic properties contributing to privacy leaks.

Result: DeepLeak reduces membership leakage by up to 95% with minimal utility loss (≤3.3%) across 15 explanation techniques and image benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeepLeak provides a reproducible framework for achieving safer ML explainability in privacy-sensitive applications by balancing transparency and privacy effectively.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) explainability is central to algorithmic transparency in high-stakes settings such as predictive diagnostics and loan approval. However, these same domains require rigorous privacy guaranties, creating tension between interpretability and privacy. Although prior work has shown that explanation methods can leak membership information, practitioners still lack systematic guidance on selecting or deploying explanation techniques that balance transparency with privacy.
  We present DeepLeak, a system to audit and mitigate privacy risks in post-hoc explanation methods. DeepLeak advances the state-of-the-art in three ways: (1) comprehensive leakage profiling: we develop a stronger explanation-aware membership inference attack (MIA) to quantify how much representative explanation methods leak membership information under default configurations; (2) lightweight hardening strategies: we introduce practical, model-agnostic mitigations, including sensitivity-calibrated noise, attribution clipping, and masking, that substantially reduce membership leakage while preserving explanation utility; and (3) root-cause analysis: through controlled experiments, we pinpoint algorithmic properties (e.g., attribution sparsity and sensitivity) that drive leakage.
  Evaluating 15 explanation techniques across four families on image benchmarks, DeepLeak shows that default settings can leak up to 74.9% more membership information than previously reported. Our mitigations cut leakage by up to 95% (minimum 46.5%) with only <=3.3% utility loss on average. DeepLeak offers a systematic, reproducible path to safer explainability in privacy-sensitive ML.

### [373] [Deontic Knowledge Graphs for Privacy Compliance in Multimodal Disaster Data Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03587)
*Kelvin Uzoma Echenim,Karuna Pande Joshi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining disaster management and privacy policies into a knowledge graph system for better privacy-compliant information sharing during disaster responses, demonstrating high accuracy and fast decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster response involves sharing sensitive data under privacy constraints, but current systems often use inflexible access controls, impeding effective information sharing during critical workflows.

Method: The authors developed a framework integrating a Disaster Management Knowledge Graph (DKG) with a Policy Knowledge Graph (PKG) guided by IoT and FEMA/DHS regulations. It provides three outcomes for data sharing decisions: Allow, Block, and Allow-with-Transform.

Result: The framework evaluated on a 5.1M-triple DKG database achieved exact-match decision accuracy, sub-second latency for decisions, and interactive performance for queries on both standalone and federated setups.

Conclusion: This proposed knowledge graph-based framework demonstrates effective compliance with privacy mandates while maintaining agility and accuracy for disaster response data sharing.

Abstract: Disaster response requires sharing heterogeneous artifacts, from tabular assistance records to UAS imagery, under overlapping privacy mandates. Operational systems often reduce compliance to binary access control, which is brittle in time-critical workflows. We present a novel deontic knowledge graph-based framework that integrates a Disaster Management Knowledge Graph (DKG) with a Policy Knowledge Graph (PKG) derived from IoT-Reg and FEMA/DHS privacy drivers. Our release decision function supports three outcomes: Allow, Block, and Allow-with-Transform. The latter binds obligations to transforms and verifies post-transform compliance via provenance-linked derived artifacts; blocked requests are logged as semantic privacy incidents. Evaluation on a 5.1M-triple DKG with 316K images shows exact-match decision correctness, sub-second per-decision latency, and interactive query performance across both single-graph and federated workloads.

*Songyang Liu,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Pu,Litian Zhang,Chenxu Wang,Zejian Chen,Yuting Zhang,Yiming Hei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FJAR, a fine-grained jailbreak evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that improves accuracy by categorizing responses comprehensively and using anchored references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of evaluating jailbreak attacks on LLMs are coarse and overestimate attack success, necessitating a more precise evaluation strategy.

Method: FJAR categorizes jailbreak responses into five categories and uses harmless tree decomposition to create anchored references that guide evaluators in assessing whether responses fulfill malicious queries.

Result: FJAR aligns well with human judgment and accurately identifies causes of jailbreak failures, facilitating better attack strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed FJAR framework refines jailbreak evaluation for LLMs, offering a more accurate and actionable method compared to current approaches.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks present a significant challenge to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current automated evaluation methods largely rely on coarse classifications that focus mainly on harmfulness, leading to substantial overestimation of attack success. To address this problem, we propose FJAR, a fine-grained jailbreak evaluation framework with anchored references. We first categorized jailbreak responses into five fine-grained categories: Rejective, Irrelevant, Unhelpful, Incorrect, and Successful, based on the degree to which the response addresses the malicious intent of the query. This categorization serves as the basis for FJAR. Then, we introduce a novel harmless tree decomposition approach to construct high-quality anchored references by breaking down the original queries. These references guide the evaluator in determining whether the response genuinely fulfills the original query. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FJAR achieves the highest alignment with human judgment and effectively identifies the root causes of jailbreak failures, providing actionable guidance for improving attack strategies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reviews privacy risks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, systematizing findings into a taxonomy, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify privacy risks in RAG systems due to their coupling with domain-specific, potentially sensitive databases.

Method: A systematic literature review of works addressing privacy in RAG, leading to a taxonomy and process diagram.

Result: Findings include categorized privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies in RAG systems.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of privacy in RAG by systematizing risks, proposed mitigations, and evaluating their maturity.

Abstract: The continued promise of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in their natural language understanding and generation capabilities, has driven a rapidly increasing interest in identifying and developing LLM use cases. In an effort to complement the ingrained "knowledge" of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have become widely popular. At its core, RAG involves the coupling of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases, whereby the generation of a response to a user question is augmented with contextual and up-to-date information. The proliferation of RAG has sparked concerns about data privacy, particularly with the inherent risks that arise when leveraging databases with potentially sensitive information. Numerous recent works have explored various aspects of privacy risks in RAG systems, from adversarial attacks to proposed mitigations. With the goal of surveying and unifying these works, we ask one simple question: What are the privacy risks in RAG, and how can they be measured and mitigated? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic literature review of RAG works addressing privacy, and we systematize our findings into a comprehensive set of privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies. We supplement these findings with two primary artifacts: a Taxonomy of RAG Privacy Risks and a RAG Privacy Process Diagram. Our work contributes to the study of privacy in RAG not only by conducting the first systematization of risks and mitigations, but also by uncovering important considerations when mitigating privacy risks in RAG systems and assessing the current maturity of proposed mitigations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HoneyTrap is a deceptive defense framework against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on large language models, combining collaborative agents to waste attacker resources effectively and provide resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combat the challenge of rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting large language models.

Method: HoneyTrap integrates four collaborative defensive agents and introduces two novel metrics while evaluating using the MTJ-Pro dataset.

Result: This framework reduced attack success rates by 68.77% and improved novel metrics MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.

Conclusion: HoneyTrap demonstrates resilience against sophisticated attacks, efficiently reducing risks without hindering benign query processing.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose significant threats to large language models (LLMs), enabling attackers to bypass safeguards. However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.

*Nadav Kunievsky,Pedro Pertusi*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper studies socioeconomic-status gaps in writing assessments and separates content from style using a new large language model approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent gaps in test scores across socioeconomic backgrounds influence unequal educational and labor-market outcomes. Writing assessments combine students' ideas and expressive skill, potentially conflating SES differences in content and style.

Method: A new measurement method uses large language models to generate stylistic variants of student essays, creating a controlled panel to differentiate content and style contributions to SES score gaps.

Result: The SES gap in writing scores is 0.67 points (1-6 scale): 69% due to content, 26% due to style, and 5% due to evaluation standards. This pattern is consistent across demographic groups and tasks.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively isolate and quantify intertwined variables, offering insights on SES disparities in writing assessments and broader research applications.

Abstract: Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a "generated panel" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors.

*Nithinkumar K.,Anand R*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid deep learning model for imbalanced respiratory sound classification, addressing challenges in subtle acoustic differences and severe class imbalance, achieving significant improvement in minority class detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in respiratory sound classification arise due to subtle acoustic differences among sound patterns and an extreme class imbalance in clinical datasets. Addressing these issues is critical for accurate disease diagnosis.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid deep learning model integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sequential feature encoding and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for classification. Additional methods such as focal loss, data augmentation, and SMOTE were used to mitigate class imbalance.

Result: The proposed model achieves an overall accuracy of 94.6% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.703. It also shows improved detection of minority classes compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the Hybrid LSTM-KAN model, when combined with class imbalance mitigation strategies, effectively addresses the challenges of imbalanced respiratory sound classification while improving minority class detection.

Abstract: Respiratory sounds captured via auscultation contain critical clues for diagnosing pulmonary conditions. Automated classification of these sounds faces challenges due to subtle acoustic differences and severe class imbalance in clinical datasets. This study investigates respiratory sound classification with a focus on mitigating pronounced class imbalance. We propose a hybrid deep learning model that combines a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential feature encoding with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for classification. The model is integrated with a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline and targeted imbalance mitigation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a public respiratory sound database comprising six classes with a highly skewed distribution. Techniques such as focal loss, class-specific data augmentation, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were employed to enhance minority class recognition. The proposed Hybrid LSTM-KAN model achieves an overall accuracy of 94.6 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.703, despite the dominant COPD class accounting for over 86 percent of the data. Improved detection performance is observed for minority classes compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for imbalanced respiratory sound classification.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper adapts a voice conversion framework to improve Electro-laryngeal (EL) speech, focusing on naturalness and intelligibility, achieving significant advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EL speech lacks naturalness and intelligibility due to constant pitch, limited prosody, and mechanical noise, requiring an effective rehabilitation approach.

Method: Adapting the StreamVC framework by removing pitch and energy modules, combining self-supervised pretraining with supervised fine-tuning on parallel EL and healthy speech data, aided by perceptual and intelligibility losses.

Result: The best model variant reduced Character Error Rate (CER), increased naturalness score (nMOS from 1.1 to 3.3), and narrowed gaps in metrics compared to healthy speech.

Conclusion: Lightweight voice conversion architectures can be effectively adapted for EL voice rehabilitation; however, further improvements in prosody generation and intelligibility are needed.

Abstract: Electro-laryngeal (EL) speech is characterized by constant pitch, limited prosody, and mechanical noise, reducing naturalness and intelligibility. We propose a lightweight adaptation of the state-of-the-art StreamVC framework to this setting by removing pitch and energy modules and combining self-supervised pretraining with supervised fine-tuning on parallel EL and healthy (HE) speech data, guided by perceptual and intelligibility losses. Objective and subjective evaluations across different loss configurations confirm their influence: the best model variant, based on WavLM features and human-feedback predictions (+WavLM+HF), drastically reduces character error rate (CER) of EL inputs, raises naturalness mean opinion score (nMOS) from 1.1 to 3.3, and consistently narrows the gap to HE ground-truth speech in all evaluated metrics. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of adapting lightweight voice conversion architectures to EL voice rehabilitation while also identifying prosody generation and intelligibility improvements as the main remaining bottlenecks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Muse, an open-source system for long-form song generation with style control, supported by a synthetic dataset and evaluation pipelines, offering competitive performance despite modest resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in reproducibility and fair comparison in academic research on long-form song generation by providing an open-source solution and licensed dataset.

Method: The method involves training Muse, a song generation model, using supervised finetuning of a Qwen-based language model with discrete audio tokens without additional specific losses or objectives.

Result: Muse demonstrates competitive performance in phoneme error rate, style-text similarity, audio quality, and controllable musical structure generation, despite limited resources used in training.

Conclusion: Muse is a promising, fully open-source contribution to long-form song generation research, facilitating comparison, reproducibility, and further advancements by releasing datasets, models, and pipelines.

Abstract: Recent commercial systems such as Suno demonstrate strong capabilities in long-form song generation, while academic research remains largely non-reproducible due to the lack of publicly available training data, hindering fair comparison and progress. To this end, we release a fully open-source system for long-form song generation with fine-grained style conditioning, including a licensed synthetic dataset, training and evaluation pipelines, and Muse, an easy-to-deploy song generation model. The dataset consists of 116k fully licensed synthetic songs with automatically generated lyrics and style descriptions paired with audio synthesized by SunoV5. We train Muse via single-stage supervised finetuning of a Qwen-based language model extended with discrete audio tokens using MuCodec, without task-specific losses, auxiliary objectives, or additional architectural components. Our evaluations find that although Muse is trained with a modest data scale and model size, it achieves competitive performance on phoneme error rate, text--music style similarity, and audio aesthetic quality, while enabling controllable segment-level generation across different musical structures. All data, model weights, and training and evaluation pipelines will be publicly released, paving the way for continued progress in controllable long-form song generation research.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: IndexTTS 2.5 is an advanced zero-shot neural text-to-speech model improving multilingual support, efficiency, and emotion replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a TTS model with enhanced multilingual capabilities, efficient processing, and high-quality emotional replication under zero-shot conditions.

Method: Improves upon IndexTTS 2 by compressing semantic codec sequences, upgrading model architecture, implementing cross-lingual strategies, and using reinforcement learning for optimization.

Result: IndexTTS 2.5 broadens language coverage, accurately transfers emotions across languages, and achieves significant inference speedup (2.28x RTF improvement).

Conclusion: IndexTTS 2.5 demonstrates advanced TTS synthesis with expanded language support, efficient processing, and emotional fidelity, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: In prior work, we introduced IndexTTS 2, a zero-shot neural text-to-speech foundation model comprising two core components: a transformer-based Text-to-Semantic (T2S) module and a non-autoregressive Semantic-to-Mel (S2M) module, which together enable faithful emotion replication and establish the first autoregressive duration-controllable generative paradigm. Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.

*Guotao Li,Shaoyun Xu,Yuexing Hao,Yang Wang,Yuhui Sun*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents PC2P, a novel approach to distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), which outperforms existing methods by enhancing communication, perception, and resolving deadlocks in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed MAPF approaches struggle with insufficient collaborative and perceptual abilities, making them insufficient for dynamically scalable application across varied environments.

Method: The proposed method, PC2P, uses a Q-learning-based MARL framework. It incorporates personalized-enhanced communication through a dynamic graph, a local crowd perception mechanism for enriched observation, and a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy guided by expert inputs.

Result: Experimental results validate PC2P’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods across various environments, with ablation studies supporting the significance of its individual components.

Conclusion: PC2P effectively addresses key limitations in collaborative and heuristic observation and introduces efficient solutions for deadlock resolution, improving distributed MAPF in complex and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.

*Alessio Buscemi,Daniele Proverbio,Alessandro Di Stefano,The Anh Han,German Castignani,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems in game-theoretic settings, studying how agents coordinate without explicit communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamics of implicit coordination (covert communication) among LLM-based agents in multi-agent, strategic settings.

Method: The study employs a game-theoretic framework across four game settings, varying the communication regimes (explicit, restricted, absent) and analyzing agent interactions with heterogeneous personalities in both one-shot and repeated games.

Result: The analysis reveals the conditions under which covert signals emerge, influencing coordination and strategic outcomes among agents.

Conclusion: Understanding covert communication can enhance coordination strategies in multi-agent LLM systems when explicit communication is limited or unavailable.

Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.

*Yunhao Fan,Gia-Wei Chern*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using equivariant neural networks for adiabatic dynamical simulations of lattice models, addressing limitations of traditional symmetry-aware descriptors and increasing transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML force fields rely on hand-crafted symmetry-aware descriptors, limiting generality and transferability across lattice Hamiltonians. The paper seeks to develop a more general approach.

Method: The authors propose a data-driven framework embedding discrete point-group and internal symmetries into neural networks for predicting forces in lattice Hamiltonians, applied to the Holstein Hamiltonian as a test case.

Result: The ENN-based framework captures mesoscale symmetry-breaking dynamics and enables large-scale simulations with fidelity to emergent behaviors in condensed-matter systems.

Conclusion: ENN-based force fields enhance generality and accuracy for modeling lattice dynamics, demonstrating their utility for linking microscopic processes to emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolving Industrial 4.0 presents challenges like dynamic QoS requirements and effective mobile equipment management, which existing TSCH-based networks fail to address systematically.

Method: Proposes Monaas, with a hierarchical design, task-driven scheduling, and on-demand mobile resource integration, validated on nRF52840 hardware testbeds.

Result: Achieved over 98% Task Completion Rate (TCR) for high-priority tasks under challenging conditions and faster service activations compared to existing models.

Conclusion: Monaas showcases significant improvements in handling dynamic IIoT tasks and integrating mobile resources, outperforming existing TSCH-based systems.

Abstract: The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 standard provides ultra high end-to-end reliability and low-power consumption for application in field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (> 5.8 s).

TL;DR: The paper introduces CellPilot, a reinforcement learning framework to optimize cell reselection in mobile networks, improving network performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing cell selection for maximizing network performance in highly dynamic environments, especially considering the coexistence of 4G and 5G networks.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based framework (CellPilot) is proposed to adaptively tune cell reselection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns in network dynamics.

Result: Experiments with real-world data demonstrate that CellPilot outperforms manual heuristic methods by up to 167% and generalizes effectively across various network conditions.

Conclusion: Data-driven adaptive approaches like CellPilot can significantly enhance mobile network performance by optimizing cell reselection configurations.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of 5G networks, together with the coexistence of 4G/LTE networks, provides mobile devices a diverse set of candidate cells to connect to. However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional operator learning models (e.g., DeepONet), which need extensive datasets and struggle with discontinuous solutions or sharp features in PDEs.

Method: This paper introduces the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Operator Network (DG-FEONet) that utilizes the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme to minimize residuals of a DG-based weak PDE formulation without needing precomputed datasets.

Result: DG-FEONet demonstrated accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameters, and reliable convergence rates for one- and two-dimensional PDE problems.

Conclusion: Combining local discretization schemes and machine learning offers a robust and singularity-aware approach for challenging PDE tasks, highlighting the potential of DG-FEONet for operator approximation.

Abstract: We introduce Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Operator Network (DG--FEONet), a data-free operator learning framework that combines the strengths of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with neural networks to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous coefficients and non-smooth solutions. Unlike traditional operator learning models such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, which require large paired datasets and often struggle near sharp features, our approach minimizes the residual of a DG-based weak formulation using the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme. DG-FEONet predicts element-wise solution coefficients via a neural network, enabling data-free training without the need for precomputed input-output pairs. We provide theoretical justification through convergence analysis and validate the model's performance on a series of one- and two-dimensional PDE problems, demonstrating accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameter space, and reliable convergence rates. Our results highlight the potential of combining local discretization schemes with machine learning to achieve robust, singularity-aware operator approximation in challenging PDE settings.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses motion control challenges with UAVs carrying slung loads using an innovative modeling approach, presenting a cascade control strategy and validating it through simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient control of UAVs with slung loads is needed due to practical challenges arising from suspending loads not aligned with the UAV's center of mass, leading to complex dynamics.

Method: The paper develops a model based on the suspension point instead of the UAV's center of mass, introduces a cascade control strategy, and employs Lyapunov stability for theoretical validation.

Result: Local exponential stability of the control system was proven, and simulations and experiments validated the proposed strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed control system effectively addresses the coupling issues in slung load UAV systems, offering improved stability and control accuracy.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. Using the off-center reference frame, an inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the safety, protocol compliance, and efficiency of LLM-controlled UAVs under realistic next-generation networking conditions, which are critical for advanced autonomous operations.

Method: A benchmark called $α^3$-Bench was developed, simulating UAV missions as conversational reasoning and control problems. It includes a dataset of 113k conversational UAV episodes, dual action layers for evaluation, and a composite $α^3$ metric measuring six performance pillars.

Result: The evaluations of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs revealed variations in robustness and efficiency under degraded 6G conditions, despite high mission success and safety compliance in numerous cases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based UAV agents but underscores the necessity for network-aware and resource-efficient improvements to achieve consistent performance under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as high level controllers for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions. However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $α^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations.
  To reflect modern agentic workflows, $α^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $α^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems by leveraging Markov decision processes (MDP) and optimizing EV energy management for cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and high costs associated with managing dynamic energy use in V2B systems due to fluctuating electricity pricing, long planning horizons, and diverse charging infrastructures.

Method: The optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), with online search to handle large state spaces and domain-specific heuristics to narrow action choices.

Result: The framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods in energy optimization, validated using data from Nissan's EV testbed.

Conclusion: Modeling V2B systems as an MDP, combined with tailored optimizations, improves cost efficiency and meets user-specific requirements effectively.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in modern microgrids arising from cyber-physical disturbances due to distributed sensing and communication interfaces.

Method: Developed a virtual microgrid with secondary controllers, implemented various cyberattack types using a structured framework in MGLib, and trained LightGBM models for intrusion detection using the generated labeled datasets.

Result: Achieved 94.8% accuracy and 94.3% F1 score for binary detection and 99.72% accuracy with 99.62% F1 score for multiclass attack classification. Real-time tests confirmed suitability for edge deployment.

Conclusion: Lightweight machine learning models can accurately and efficiently detect cyberattacks in microgrids without requiring complex deep learning methods. The work emphasizes practicality in microgrid cybersecurity.

Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.

### [392] [Provable Acceleration of Distributed Optimization with Local Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03442)
*Zuang Wang,Yongqiang Wang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper investigates incorporating local updates in distributed optimization using the DIGing algorithm, and shows that small numbers of local updates accelerate optimization without requiring step size reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to explore whether multiple local updates, inspired by their success in federated learning, can aid in accelerating distributed optimization without sacrificing performance or necessitating reduced step sizes.

Method: The paper leverages Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to analyze the DIGing algorithm and conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to examine the effects of multiple local updates.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that two local updates achieve maximal acceleration in optimization and that additional updates do not provide significant benefits. The results align with experimental validation.

Conclusion: Incorporating only two local updates is optimal for distributed optimization in terms of computational efficiency and convergence performance, offering practical insights into algorithm design.

Abstract: In conventional distributed optimization, each agent performs a single local update between two communication rounds with its neighbors to synchronize solutions. Inspired by the success of using multiple local updates in federated learning, incorporating local updates into distributed optimization has recently attracted increasing attention. However, unlike federated learning, where multiple local updates can accelerate learning by improving gradient estimation under mini-batch settings, it remains unclear whether similar benefits hold in distributed optimization when gradients are exact. Moreover, existing theoretical results typically require reducing the step size when multiple local updates are employed, which can entirely offset any potential benefit of these additional local updates and obscure their true impact on convergence. In this paper, we focus on the classic DIGing algorithm and leverage the tight performance bounds provided by Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to show that incorporating local updates can indeed accelerate distributed optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration of such acceleration for a broad class of objective functions. Our analysis further reveals that, under an appropriate step size, performing only two local updates is sufficient to achieve the maximal possible improvement, and that additional local updates provide no further gains. Because more updates increase computational cost, these findings offer practical guidance for efficient implementation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical findings.

*Simon Halvdansson,Lucas Ferreira Bernardino,Brage Rugstad Knudsen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sizing framework for renewable energy and storage systems in isolated setups focusing on optimal control and emission reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of decarbonizing isolated energy systems while integrating renewable energy and ensuring optimal balance under uncertainty.

Method: The study uses an imitation learning method for stochastic neural model predictive control to analyze sizing while integrating uncertain renewable sources.

Result: The approach shows a complex relationship between storage/wind capacities, investment costs, and emission reductions, tested on an offshore energy system.

Conclusion: Optimal control and proper system design are crucial for isolated energy systems, highlighting the need for advanced sizing frameworks that consider uncertainties and finite outlooks.

Abstract: Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.

### [394] [Measures of classification bias derived from sample size analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03453)
*Ioannis Ivrissimtzis,Shauna Concannon,Matthew Houliston,Graham Roberts*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new measure of algorithmic bias based on the statistical sample size required to detect bias and compares it to two other conventional measures, showcasing its advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing measures of algorithmic bias, such as error rate differences or ratios, may not fully capture the nuances of classification bias. The goal is to develop a more intuitive and fundamental measure based on sample size requirements for statistical detection of bias.

Method: The authors introduce a measure for bias that inversely relates to the required sample size for detecting differences in error rates between two demographics. They evaluate its properties using a chi-squared test formula and compare it against conventional statistics like error differences and ratios.

Result: The new measure ranks algorithmic bias differently from traditional measures, highlighting its ability to address limitations of existing approaches. The measure's properties are shown to stem from intrinsic methodological principles.

Conclusion: The proposed measure demonstrates potential to more effectively evaluate algorithmic bias due to its reliance on statistical detection principles rather than simple error comparisons. It could also be extended to multi-demographic scenarios.

Abstract: We propose the use of a simple intuitive principle for measuring algorithmic classification bias: the significance of the differences in a classifier's error rates across the various demographics is inversely commensurate with the sample size required to statistically detect them. That is, if large sample sizes are required to statistically establish biased behavior, the algorithm is less biased, and vice versa. In a simple setting, we assume two distinct demographics, and non-parametric estimates of the error rates on them, e1 and e2, respectively. We use a well-known approximate formula for the sample size of the chi-squared test, and verify some basic desirable properties of the proposed measure. Next, we compare the proposed measure with two other commonly used statistics, the difference e2-e1 and the ratio e2/e1 of the error rates. We establish that the proposed measure is essentially different in that it can rank algorithms for bias differently, and we discuss some of its advantages over the other two measures. Finally, we briefly discuss how some of the desirable properties of the proposed measure emanate from fundamental characteristics of the method, rather than the approximate sample size formula we used, and thus, are expected to hold in more complex settings with more than two demographics.

### [395] [From No-Regret to Strategically Robust Learning in Repeated Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03853)
*Junyao Zhao*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper extends strategic robustness guarantees in Bayesian auctions to all no-regret algorithms using gradient feedback, showcasing a connection between regret learning and auction theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the conditions under which no-regret algorithms ensure strategic robustness in auctions, extending prior work focused on agile OGD.

Method: The authors examine no-regret algorithms like MWU using gradient feedback in auctions satisfying allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation, and establish connections between regret minimization and auction theory.

Result: They prove that no-regret strategies, like MWU, provide robust guarantees in auction settings regardless of auction format changes, translating standard regret guarantees into strategic ones.

Conclusion: No-regret algorithms, under specific learning feedback, generalize and achieve both optimal regret and robust strategic outcomes in dynamic auction environments.

Abstract: In Bayesian single-item auctions, a monotone bidding strategy--one that prescribes a higher bid for a higher value type--can be equivalently represented as a partition of the quantile space into consecutive intervals corresponding to increasing bids. Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.
  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and the best-known strategic robustness guarantee. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory. This showcases the potential of translating standard regret guarantees into strategic robustness guarantees for specific games, without explicitly minimizing any form of swap regret.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for sequential recommendation, compressing user histories into tokens for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in transformer-based recommender systems due to their quadratic scalability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Compress long user interaction histories into learnable tokens and combine them with recent interactions to generate recommendations.

Result: Achieved reduced computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy across several tested models.

Conclusion: The approach enhances both efficiency and performance in sequential recommendations and can be adapted to existing transformer-based models.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed success of sequential modeling, generative recommender, and large language model for recommendation. Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Shielded RecRL generates personalized explanations for recommender systems while preserving their ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rich, personalized explanations in recommender systems without sacrificing ranking accuracy.

Method: Uses a two-tower architecture, integrating a language model to produce explanations based on a composite reward signal, fine-tuned via PPO with LoRA adapters.

Result: Improved click-through rate by 22.5% while maintaining recommendation ranking behavior.

Conclusion: Enhances user experience with detailed explanations without compromising recommender system accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Shielded RecRL, a reinforcement learning approach to generate personalized explanations for recommender systems without sacrificing the system's original ranking performance. Unlike prior RLHF-based recommender methods that directly optimize item rankings, our two-tower architecture keeps the recommender's ranking model intact while a language model learns to produce helpful explanations. We design a composite reward signal combining explanation length, content relevance, and coherence, and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a KL-divergence constraint to fine-tune a large language model with only 0.4% of its parameters trainable via LoRA adapters. In experiments on an Amazon Books dataset (approximately 50K interactions in the fantasy and romance genres), Shielded RecRL improved the relative click-through rate (CTR) by 22.5% (1.225x over baseline) while keeping the recommender's item-ranking behavior virtually unchanged. An extensive ablation study confirms that our gradient shielding strategy and reward design effectively balance explanation quality and policy drift. Our results demonstrate that Shielded RecRL enhances user-facing aspects of recommendations through rich, personalized explanations without degrading core recommendation accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper surveys the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in visually rich documents (VRDs) and categorizes existing approaches into three roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by VRDs, like layout-dependent semantics and evidence distributed across complex structures, in RAG systems.

Method: The authors categorize MLLM roles into Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. They analyze these roles on metrics such as fidelity, latency, and index size while offering practical guidance.

Result: The paper provides a detailed comparison of MLLM roles in VRD retrieval and identifies key trade-offs for choosing among them. It also highlights open challenges.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on adaptive retrieval units, reducing model sizes, and creating better evaluation methods to enhance VRD retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Visually rich documents (VRDs) challenge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with layout-dependent semantics, brittle OCR, and evidence spread across complex figures and structured tables. This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.

### [399] [STELLA: Self-Reflective Terminology-Aware Framework for Building an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03496)
*Bongmin Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the STELLA framework and benchmark as an aerospace-specific Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports to address domain-specific challenges in terminology and query intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a public IR benchmark tailored for aerospace tasks that require specific terminology understanding and query intent reflection.

Method: The STELLA framework involves a systematic pipeline of document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary creation, synthetic query design, and cross-lingual extensions. It generates Terminology Concordant Queries (TCQ) for lexical matching and Terminology Agnostic Queries (TAQ) for semantic evaluation.

Result: Seven embedding models were evaluated, finding that large decoder-based models excel in semantic understanding while lexical matching methods like BM25 perform well in exact terminology-specific tasks.

Conclusion: The STELLA benchmark is a reproducible and reliable tool for evaluating embedding models' performance in aerospace-domain IR tasks, fostering improvements in this specialized field.

Abstract: Tasks in the aerospace industry heavily rely on searching and reusing large volumes of technical documents, yet there is no public information retrieval (IR) benchmark that reflects the terminology- and query-intent characteristics of this domain. To address this gap, this paper proposes the STELLA (Self-Reflective TErminoLogy-Aware Framework for BuiLding an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark) framework. Using this framework, we introduce the STELLA benchmark, an aerospace-specific IR evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) documents via a systematic pipeline that comprises document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary construction, synthetic query generation, and cross-lingual extension. The framework generates two types of queries: the Terminology Concordant Query (TCQ), which includes the terminology verbatim to evaluate lexical matching, and the Terminology Agnostic Query (TAQ), which utilizes the terminology's description to assess semantic matching. This enables a disentangled evaluation of the lexical and semantic matching capabilities of embedding models. In addition, we combine Chain-of-Density (CoD) and the Self-Reflection method with query generation to improve quality and implement a hybrid cross-lingual extension that reflects real user querying practices. Evaluation of seven embedding models on the STELLA benchmark shows that large decoder-based embedding models exhibit the strongest semantic understanding, while lexical matching methods such as BM25 remain highly competitive in domains where exact lexical matching technical term is crucial. The STELLA benchmark provides a reproducible foundation for reliable performance evaluation and improvement of embedding models in aerospace-domain IR tasks.

### [400] [Bridging OLAP and RAG: A Multidimensional Approach to the Design of Corpus Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03748)
*Dario Maio,Stefano Rizzi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes the use of semantic clustering and a Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) to improve scalability and explainability in large-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems face scalability challenges with large-scale document collections and lack a conceptual framework for effective corpus partitioning, relying instead on ad hoc, similarity-driven methods.

Method: The authors propose combining semantic clustering to optimize embedding locality with multidimensional partitioning, guided by a Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) that organizes retrieval dimensions like time and organizational context.

Result: The DFM introduces hierarchical routing and controlled fallback in retrievals, making the process more robust and governable, while transforming retrieval systems from similarity-based to conceptual workflow-based.

Conclusion: This framework bridges OLAP multidimensional modeling and RAG architecture, offering a principled way to design scalable and explainable retrieval strategies, and calls for further research in this direction.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automated theorem proving specifically for the first-order logic of here and there (HT), improving efficiency through new methods and benchmarks.

Method: The provers utilize a native sequent calculus, optimized with techniques like free variables and skolemization, alongside an axiomatic embedding into intuitionistic logic, employing various calculi.

Result: The paper evaluates these provers on a large benchmark set of formulas to measure their efficiency and establish a baseline.

Conclusion: These automated theorem provers provide a solid foundation for enhancing first-order logic HT provers in the future.

Abstract: We present automated theorem provers for the first-order logic of here and there (HT). They are based on a native sequent calculus for the logic of HT and an axiomatic embedding of the logic of HT into intuitionistic logic. The analytic proof search in the sequent calculus is optimized by using free variables and skolemization. The embedding is used in combination with sequent, tableau and connection calculi for intuitionistic first-order logic. All provers are evaluated on a large benchmark set of first-order formulas, providing a foundation for the development of more efficient HT provers.

### [402] [Automated Theorem Proving for Prolog Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03849)
*Fred Mesnard,Thierry Marianne,Étienne Payet*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: LPTP is a theorem prover for verifying Prolog programs using natural deduction. This study introduces a method to utilize automated theorem provers for this process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the verification of Prolog programs by employing automated theorem provers instead of relying solely on the interactive LPTP tool.

Method: The authors translate first-order axioms associated with Prolog programs into first-order formulas (FOFs) and use automated theorem provers to verify properties of interest.

Result: Experiments were conducted over 400 Prolog program properties, demonstrating the applicability of automated theorem provers in program verification.

Conclusion: Using automated theorem provers and FOF translation improves the efficiency of verifying Prolog program properties, providing resources like a compiler and benchmarks for public use.

Abstract: LPTP (Logic Program Theorem Prover) is an interactive natural-deduction-based theorem  prover for pure Prolog programs with negation as failure, unification with the occurs check, and a restricted but extensible set of built-in predicates. With LPTP, one can formally prove termination  and partial correctness of such Prolog programs. LPTP was designed in the mid-1990's by Robert F. Staerk.  It is written in ISO-Prolog and comes with an Emacs user-interface. 
  From a theoretical point of view, in his publications about LPTP, Staerk associates a set of first-order axioms IND(P) to the considered Prolog program P.  IND(P) contains the Clark's equality theory for P,  definitions of success, failure and termination for each user-defined logic procedure in P,  axioms relating these three points of view, and an axiom schema for  proving inductive properties. LPTP is thus a dedicated proof editor where these axioms are hard-wired. 
  We propose to translate these axioms as first-order formulas (FOFs), and apply automated theorem provers to  check the property of interest. Using  FOF  as an intermediary language, we experiment the use of automated theorem  provers for Prolog program verification. We evaluate the approach over  a benchmark of about 400 properties of Prolog  programs from the library available with LPTP. Both the  compiler which generates a set of FOF files from a given input  Prolog program together with its properties and the benchmark are publicly available.

*Josef Urban*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The project autoformalized a significant portion of general topology from Munkres' textbook using LLMs and a proof-checking system. It produced 160k lines of formalization in weeks for a low cost, showing potential for easier and widespread formalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the feasibility of automating topology formalization using inexpensive, fast, and accessible resources, making such practices more universal and approachable.

Method: The approach involves a feedback loop between an LLM-based system (ChatGPT/Claude) and a proof checker (Megalodon), combined with prompt engineering and foundational libraries for topology formalization.

Result: The project formalized 160k lines of topology, including key proofs like Urysohn's lemma and Tietze's extension theorem, for a total LLM cost of approximately $100.

Conclusion: Autoformalization is now cost-effective and efficient, suggesting potential for widespread, accessible formalization practices in mathematical proof systems moving forward.

Abstract: This is a brief description of a project that has already autoformalized a large portion of the general topology from the Munkres textbook (which has in total 241 pages in 7 chapters and 39 sections). The project has been running since November 21, 2025 and has as of January 4, 2026, produced 160k lines of formalized topology. Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks,from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about \$100. This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn's lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn's Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems). The approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library. The LLM is now instantiated as ChatGPT (mostly 5.2) or Claude Sonnet (4.5) run through the respective Codex or Claude Code command line interfaces. The proof checker is Chad Brown's higher-order set theory system Megalodon, and the core library is Brown's formalization of basic set theory and surreal numbers (including reals, etc). The rest is some prompt engineering and technical choices which we describe here. Based on the fast progress, low cost, virtually unknown ITP/library, and the simple setup available to everyone, we believe that (auto)formalization may become quite easy and ubiquitous in 2026, regardless of which proof assistant is used.

*Van-Giang Trinh,Sylvain Soliman,François Fages,Belaid Benhamou*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'trap space semantics,' a new interpretation framework for normal logic programs, linking it with both model-theoretic and dynamical semantics while uncovering deeper relationships among established semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified and precise framework for understanding the semantics of normal logic programs, addressing gaps in existing studies by combining model-theoretic semantics with dynamical interpretations.

Method: The authors generalize the 'trap space' concept from Datalog^\neg programs to arbitrary normal logic programs, formulating 'trap space semantics' and systematically relating it to both theoretical and dynamical semantics of logic programs.

Result: The trap space semantics provides a comprehensive framework for proving the existence of various models (supported classes, strict stable classes, regular models) and reveals connections among existing semantics of normal logic programs.

Conclusion: Trap space semantics advances the interpretation of normal logic programs by unifying model-theoretic and dynamical perspectives, offering insights and formal relationships between different established semantics.

Abstract: The logical semantics of normal logic programs has traditionally been based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models, including supported, stable, regular, and well-founded models. Two-valued interpretations can also be seen as states evolving under a program's update operator, producing a transition graph whose fixed points and cycles capture stable and oscillatory behaviors, respectively. We refer to this view as dynamical semantics since it characterizes the program's meaning in terms of state-space trajectories, as first introduced in the stable (supported) class semantics. Recently, we have established a formal connection between Datalog^\neg programs (i.e., normal logic programs without function symbols) and Boolean networks, leading to the introduction of the trap space concept for Datalog^\neg programs. In this paper, we generalize the trap space concept to arbitrary normal logic programs, introducing trap space semantics as a new approach to their interpretation. This new semantics admits both model-theoretic and dynamical characterizations, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding program behavior. We establish the foundational properties of the trap space semantics and systematically relate it to the established model-theoretic semantics, including the stable (supported), stable (supported) partial, regular, and L-stable model semantics, as well as to the dynamical stable (supported) class semantics. Our results demonstrate that the trap space semantics offers a unified and precise framework for proving the existence of supported classes, strict stable (supported) classes, and regular models, in addition to uncovering and formalizing deeper relationships among the existing semantics of normal logic programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing need for digital assistants capable of handling technical scientific queries and operations securely and accurately.

Method: MARVEL combines retrieval-augmented generation with a Monte Carlo Tree Search for deep query exploration, using a global evidence ledger for source tracking.

Result: MARVEL performs comparably to GPT-4 on literature queries and significantly outperforms it on domain-specific tasks like detector operations in gravitational-wave research.

Conclusion: MARVEL provides a reproducible framework for scientific assistants, emphasizing domain-specific performance and dataset availability.

Abstract: We present MARVEL (https://ligogpt.mit.edu/marvel), a locally deployable, open-source framework for domain-aware question answering and assisted scientific research. It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven method to discover ionic liquids (ILs) for CO2 capture with improved properties, resulting in economically advantageous solutions for refinery emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the environmental impact and economic cost of CO2 capture from refinery emissions, by shifting from traditional amine-based solvents to ionic liquids.

Method: A five-stage pipeline: IL candidate generation, property prediction using GNN models, thermodynamic conversion, Pareto optimization, and synthesis feasibility filtering.

Result: The approach identified 36 promising ionic liquid candidates enabling operational and capital expenditure savings.

Conclusion: This AI-driven strategy demonstrates potential in advancing carbon capture efficiency and economically benefiting refineries.

Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces the E2Former-LSR, a machine learning force field model designed to overcome limitations in long-range interactions in molecular simulations. It provides higher accuracy, stable error scaling, and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional MLFFs, which rely on fixed-cutoff architectures, making them ineffective for large macromolecular systems dominated by long-range interactions.

Method: The authors developed the MolLR25 benchmark based on DFT and introduced E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer model featuring long-range attention blocks. This approach enhances the ability to capture long-range effects.

Result: The E2Former-LSR model achieves stable error scaling, better fits non-covalent interactions, performs well on protein conformations, and offers computational efficiency (up to 30% faster than local models).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the critical need for non-local architectures in MLFFs to support simulations of large-scale chemical and biological systems with high fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have revolutionized molecular simulations by providing quantum mechanical accuracy at the speed of molecular mechanical computations. However, a fundamental reliance of these models on fixed-cutoff architectures limits their applicability to macromolecular systems where long-range interactions dominate. We demonstrate that this locality constraint causes force prediction errors to scale monotonically with system size, revealing a critical architectural bottleneck. To overcome this, we establish the systematically designed MolLR25 ({Mol}ecules with {L}ong-{R}ange effect) benchmark up to 1200 atoms, generated using high-fidelity DFT, and introduce E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer that explicitly integrates long-range attention blocks. E2Former-LSR exhibits stable error scaling, achieves superior fidelity in capturing non-covalent decay, and maintains precision on complex protein conformations. Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models. This work validates the necessity of non-local architectures for generalizable MLFFs, enabling high-fidelity molecular dynamics for large-scale chemical and biological systems.

Method: The approach integrates Neural ODEs with Continuous Normalizing Flows. It uses CNFs for efficient offline training and a variational model to optimize ELBO, which captures latent stochastic behaviors in fluid trajectories.

Result: PIVONet successfully provides a surrogate simulator capable of capturing turbulence and random fluctuations without explicit full dynamic simulations.

Conclusion: PIVONet demonstrates the potential to improve efficiency and accuracy in simulating and visualizing stochastic fluid mechanics with an advanced neural framework.

Abstract: We present PIVONet (Physically-Informed Variational ODE Neural Network), a unified framework that integrates Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neuro-ODEs) with Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) for stochastic fluid simulation and visualization. First, we demonstrate that a physically informed model, parameterized by CNF parameters θ, can be trained offline to yield an efficient surrogate simulator for a specific fluid system, eliminating the need to simulate the full dynamics explicitly. Second, by introducing a variational model with parameters φ that captures latent stochasticity in observed fluid trajectories, we model the network output as a variational distribution and optimize a pathwise Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), enabling stochastic ODE integration that captures turbulence and random fluctuations in fluid motion (advection-diffusion behaviors).

### [409] [SciNetBench: A Relation-Aware Benchmark for Scientific Literature Retrieval Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03260)
*Chenyang Shao,Yong Li,Fengli Xu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciNetBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific literature retrieval agents on relational dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current literature retrieval agents, which focus only on content-level similarities and fail to capture critical relational dynamics, leading to fragmented knowledge structures and inadequate literature reviews.

Method: The authors propose SciNetBench, a benchmark for relation-aware retrieval in scientific literature, evaluating retrieval agents based on ego-centric, pair-wise, and path-wise relational tasks using a corpus of 18 million AI papers.

Result: Their evaluation shows that current retrieval agents achieve less than 20% accuracy on relation-aware tasks. Adding relational ground truth improved literature review performance by 23.4%.

Conclusion: The study highlights a major limitation in current retrieval paradigms and demonstrates the importance of relation-aware retrieval through SciNetBench, supporting future innovations in retrieval systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI agent has spurred the development of advanced research tools, such as Deep Research. Achieving this require a nuanced understanding of the relations within scientific literature, surpasses the scope of keyword-based or embedding-based retrieval. Existing retrieval agents mainly focus on the content-level similarities and are unable to decode critical relational dynamics, such as identifying corroborating or conflicting studies or tracing technological lineages, all of which are essential for a comprehensive literature review. Consequently, this fundamental limitation often results in a fragmented knowledge structure, misleading sentiment interpretation, and inadequate modeling of collective scientific progress. To investigate relation-aware retrieval more deeply, we propose SciNetBench, the first Scientific Network Relation-aware Benchmark for literature retrieval agents. Constructed from a corpus of over 18 million AI papers, our benchmark systematically evaluates three levels of relations: ego-centric retrieval of papers with novel knowledge structures, pair-wise identification of scholarly relationships, and path-wise reconstruction of scientific evolutionary trajectories. Through extensive evaluation of three categories of retrieval agents, we find that their accuracy on relation-aware retrieval tasks often falls below 20%, revealing a core shortcoming of current retrieval paradigms. Notably, further experiments on the literature review tasks demonstrate that providing agents with relational ground truth leads to a substantial 23.4% performance improvement in the review quality, validating the critical importance of relation-aware retrieval. We publicly release our benchmark at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SciNetBench/ to support future research on advanced retrieval systems.

*Aron Gohr,Marie-Amelie Lawn,Kevin Gao,Inigo Serjeant,Stephen Heslip*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents a system using large language models for assessing free-form mathematical proofs, offering human-expert-level feedback on correctness, style, and presentation in undergraduate mathematics problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in evaluating free-form mathematical reasoning and the ability to provide immediate, automated feedback on proofs, which involves understanding technical correctness and style.

Method: The system uses large language models in a modular workflow that allows precomputing or preconfiguring certain steps. The workflow is built for flexibility and usability by instructors without programming expertise.

Result: The feedback quality of the system is shown to match that of human experts when evaluated on early undergraduate assignments, with some gaps observed in more advanced uses.

Conclusion: Deploying this system on an existing mathematics homework platform demonstrates its potential to successfully assess and complement human feedback in educational settings.

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have long enabled automated immediate feedback on student work when it is presented in a tightly structured format and when problems are very constrained, but reliably assessing free-form mathematical reasoning remains challenging.
  We present a system that processes free-form natural language input, handles a wide range of edge cases, and comments competently not only on the technical correctness of submitted proofs, but also on style and presentation issues. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to the evaluation of such a system, and show that by the metrics we evaluate, the quality of the feedback generated is comparable to that produced by human experts when assessing early undergraduate homework. We stress-test our system with a small set of more advanced and unusual questions, and report both significant gaps and encouraging successes in that more challenging setting.
  Our system uses large language models in a modular workflow. The workflow configuration is human-readable and editable without programming knowledge, and allows some intermediate steps to be precomputed or injected by the instructor.
  A version of our tool is deployed on the Imperial mathematics homework platform Lambdafeedback. We report also on the integration of our tool into this platform.

### [411] [Can AI Chatbots Provide Coaching in Engineering? Beyond Information Processing Toward Mastery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03693)
*Junaid Qadir,Muhammad Adil Attique,Saleha Shoaib,Syed Ibrahim Ghaznavi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential and limitations of AI chatbots in fostering mastery in engineering education and emphasizes maintaining human mentorship's depth alongside AI scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the double disruption in engineering education: the erosion of traditional apprenticeship models and the rise of generative AI as an informal coaching partner.

Method: A mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) was conducted to assess the use of AI chatbots for coaching in engineering education, alongside synthesizing critical perspectives from decades of expertise and human-machine interaction scholarship.

Result: Participants accept AI for technical problem-solving but are skeptical of its ability in moral, emotional, and contextual judgment. Faculty express higher risk concerns, and privacy emerges as crucial, with a majority (64-71%) demanding strict confidentiality.

Conclusion: Generative AI can provide cognitive and procedural support but cannot replicate the depth and value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. A proposed multiplex coaching framework combines human expertise with AI scalability to enhance engineering education.

Abstract: Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education.

*Anamaria Mojica-Hanke,Thomas Goger,Svenja Wölfel,Brian Valerius,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the legal implications of generating CSAM using GenAI, focusing on the potential criminal liabilities for users and those responsible for developing the models, under German law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the legal ambiguity and challenges in determining criminal liability for individuals involved in creating or using GenAI models that generate CSAM.

Method: A multidisciplinary study employing statutory interpretation of German laws combined with scenario analysis to evaluate the legal and criminal implications of GenAI in this context.

Result: The study found that generating CSAM through GenAI could have legal consequences for users and developers, influenced by technical factors like model purpose, content moderation, and the type of generated output.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for clear legal guidelines and technical measures to mitigate the risks associated with GenAI systems, emphasizing the shared responsibility of developers and users.

Abstract: The development of more powerful Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has expanded its capabilities and the variety of outputs. This has introduced significant legal challenges, including gray areas in various legal systems, such as the assessment of criminal liability for those responsible for these models. Therefore, we conducted a multidisciplinary study utilizing the statutory interpretation of relevant German laws, which, in conjunction with scenarios, provides a perspective on the different properties of GenAI in the context of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) generation. We found that generating CSAM with GenAI may have criminal and legal consequences not only for the user committing the primary offense but also for individuals responsible for the models, such as independent software developers, researchers, and company representatives. Additionally, the assessment of criminal liability may be affected by contextual and technical factors, including the type of generated image, content moderation policies, and the model's intended purpose. Based on our findings, we discussed the implications for different roles, as well as the requirements when developing such systems.

*Eldad Matmon,Amit Bracha,Noam Rotstein,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a controllable 3D caricaturization framework combining Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration and 3D Gaussian Splatting. The method enhances realism, allows local edits, and supports efficient real-time deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a photorealistic and controllable 3D caricature generation framework that overcomes the limitations of producing overly smoothed renders via traditional methods.

Method: The method uses Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration combined with 3D Gaussian Splatting. A FLAME mesh is exaggerated using a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and pseudo-ground-truth caricature images are synthesized using affine transformations. A training scheme alternates between real and synthetic supervision to enable fidelity and control.

Result: This framework produces realistic and geometry-controlled 3D caricature avatars that surpass prior methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The system achieves high photorealism, supports local edits, and offers continuous control over caricature intensity, enabling real-time deformation with bounded accuracy from closed-form solutions.

Abstract: A photorealistic and controllable 3D caricaturization framework for faces is introduced. We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.
