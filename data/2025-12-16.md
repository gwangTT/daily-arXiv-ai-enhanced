### [1] [A Monad-Based Clause Architecture for Artificial Age Score (AAS) in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11835)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that integrates mathematical and philosophical principles (via the Artificial Age Score and Leibniz's Monadology) into a controlled and interpretable design for large language model memory and behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a principled, auditable approach to govern the internal memory and behavior of large language models, which are often opaque systems.

Method: The method involves developing a clause-based architecture inspired by key concepts from Leibniz's Monadology, structured into six bundles. This architecture is implemented with Python code, applying the Artificial Age Score to guide and constrain LLM behavior.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the clause-based framework leads to interpretable, bounded behavior in LLMs. Continuous AAS trajectories, explicit penalties for contradictions, and structured improvements in performance are illustrated.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the monad-inspired system provides a transparent mechanism for monitoring and controlling artificial memory and decision-making processes in LLMs, with both philosophical depth and practical applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as powerful yet opaque systems, leaving open how their internal memory and "self-like" behavior should be governed in a principled and auditable way. The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.

### [2] [Solving Parallel Machine Scheduling With Precedences and Cumulative Resource Constraints With Calendars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11864)
*Christoph Einspieler,Matthias Horn,Marie-Louise Lackner,Patrick Malik,Nysret Musliu,Felix Winter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing parallel machine production scheduling with complex real-life constraints using a new problem variant and computational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle inefficiencies in scheduling for parallel machines in complex industrial settings, which involve job precedences and resource constraints, beyond the capacities of existing methods.

Method: Introduces a new problem variant, proposes a constraint modeling approach for small instances, and a metaheuristic with local search for large-scale cases, tested in real-world applications.

Result: The proposed metaheuristic method effectively solves large-scale industrial scheduling problems and has been implemented in a real-life industrial environment.

Conclusion: The developed techniques demonstrate success in addressing real-world parallel machine scheduling challenges, highlighting their efficiency and applicability in industrial contexts.

Abstract: The task of finding efficient production schedules for parallel machines is a challenge that arises in most industrial manufacturing domains. There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting.

### [3] [Mirror Mode in Fire Emblem: Beating Players at their own Game with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11902)
*Yanna Elizabeth Smid,Peter van der Putten,Aske Plaat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mirror Mode, an AI-based enemy strategy that mimics a player's strategy in a Unity-built game inspired by Fire Emblem Heroes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing enemy strategies to be more challenging, unpredictable, and engaging for players in turn-based games.

Method: Reinforcement Learning (Proximal Policy Optimization), Imitation Learning (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning and Behavioral Cloning), and player demonstration data.

Result: Good imitation was achieved in defensive strategies, less so for offensive strategies, with improved player satisfaction observed in Mirror Mode.

Conclusion: Refining the model might improve imitation of offensive behavior and player satisfaction when the AI mirrors the player's strategy.

Abstract: Enemy strategies in turn-based games should be surprising and unpredictable. This study introduces Mirror Mode, a new game mode where the enemy AI mimics the personal strategy of a player to challenge them to keep changing their gameplay. A simplified version of the Nintendo strategy video game Fire Emblem Heroes has been built in Unity, with a Standard Mode and a Mirror Mode. Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies. Participant's surveys indicated that they recognized their own retreating tactics, and resulted in an overall higher player-satisfaction for Mirror Mode. Refining the model further may improve imitation quality and increase player's satisfaction, especially when players face their own strategies. The full code and survey results are stored at: https://github.com/YannaSmid/MirrorMode

### [4] [Structured Personalization: Modeling Constraints as Matroids for Data-Minimal LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11907)
*Daniel Platnick,Marjan Alirezaie,Hossein Rahnama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computational method for efficiently personalizing large language models (LLMs) under real-world structural constraints by transforming user knowledge graphs and using laminar matroid theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of effectively personalizing LLMs using user-specific data while managing real-world structural constraints like dependencies, quotas, and hierarchical rules.

Method: The method involves modeling user data constraints as a laminar matroid through a process that transforms a user's knowledge graph into abstract macro-facets, enabling efficient subset selection algorithms.

Result: The authors prove that their approach supports structured personalization problems as submodular maximization under matroid constraints, providing greedy algorithms with constant-factor guarantees.

Conclusion: This work allows for more realistic and theoretically sound methods to solve personalization tasks for LLMs in real-world conditions, balancing utility and constraints.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents requires conditioning them on user-specific data, creating a critical trade-off between task utility and data disclosure. While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems.

### [5] [Causal Strengths and Leaky Beliefs: Interpreting LLM Reasoning via Noisy-OR Causal Bayes Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11909)
*Hanna Dettki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates causal reasoning in humans and LLMs by evaluating them on similar tasks using collider graph-based models and analyzing their alignment, consistency, and distinct reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strengths, weaknesses, and reasoning patterns of both humans and large language models (LLMs) in causal reasoning tasks.

Method: The study assessed over 20 LLMs and humans across eleven causal tasks, employing Direct response and Chain of Thought paradigms within a leaky noisy-OR causal Bayes net framework.

Result: LLMs and humans were compared on causal reasoning alignment, consistency at task levels, and identification of unique reasoning signatures using symmetric and asymmetric causal strength models evaluated via AIC.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into how humans and LLMs differ or align in causal reasoning, with potential implications for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The nature of intelligence in both humans and machines is a longstanding question. While there is no universally accepted definition, the ability to reason causally is often regarded as a pivotal aspect of intelligence (Lake et al., 2017). Evaluating causal reasoning in LLMs and humans on the same tasks provides hence a more comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses. Our study asks: (Q1) Are LLMs aligned with humans given the \emph{same} reasoning tasks? (Q2) Do LLMs and humans reason consistently at the task level? (Q3) Do they have distinct reasoning signatures?
  We answer these by evaluating 20+ LLMs on eleven semantically meaningful causal tasks formalized by a collider graph ($C_1\!\to\!E\!\leftarrow\!C_2$ ) under \emph{Direct} (one-shot number as response = probability judgment of query node being one and \emph{Chain of Thought} (CoT; think first, then provide answer).
  Judgments are modeled with a leaky noisy-OR causal Bayes net (CBN) whose parameters $θ=(b,m_1,m_2,p(C)) \in [0,1]$ include a shared prior $p(C)$;
  we select the winning model via AIC between a 3-parameter symmetric causal strength ($m_1{=}m_2$) and 4-parameter asymmetric ($m_1{\neq}m_2$) variant.

### [6] [Robustness of Probabilistic Models to Low-Quality Data: A Multi-Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11912)
*Liu Peng,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of modern probabilistic models against low-quality data, identifying significant variations in resilience across model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing prevalence of low-quality data and the need to understand its impact on different probabilistic models used in machine learning.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of different model types, such as autoregressive models, diffusion models, and classifiers, under varying conditions of data corruption, supported by theoretical frameworks.

Result: Autoregressive models, like GPT-2, exhibit high resilience to data corruption, while diffusion models degrade significantly, and classifiers show moderate sensitivity. Mechanistic explanations are provided based on various theoretical perspectives.

Conclusion: Data robustness varies significantly based on the model type, influenced by conditioning information and the information content in training data, with implications for model design and applications.

Abstract: A systematic, comparative investigation into the effects of low-quality data reveals a stark spectrum of robustness across modern probabilistic models. We find that autoregressive language models, from token prediction to sequence-to-sequence tasks, are remarkably resilient (for GPT-2, test NLL increases modestly from 2.87 to 3.59 despite 50% token corruption). By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics. These analyses suggest that robustness is heavily influenced by two key principles: the richness of conditioning information, which constrains the learning problem, and the absolute information content of the training data, which allows the signal from correct information to dominate statistical noise.

### [7] [CXL-SpecKV: A Disaggregated FPGA Speculative KV-Cache for Datacenter LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11920)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new KV-cache architecture called CXL-SpecKV to improve memory efficiency and throughput for large language models in data center environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising memory demands of KV-caches in large language model (LLM) deployments hinder system throughput and scalability in datacenters.

Method: CXL-SpecKV introduces (i) a memory disaggregation framework using CXL and FPGA; (ii) speculative KV-cache prefetching; and (iii) FPGA-accelerated compression to reduce bandwidth needs.

Result: CXL-SpecKV achieves a 3.2× higher throughput and 2.8× lower memory costs compared to GPU-only solutions, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: CXL-SpecKV showcases the potential of leveraging memory disaggregation and speculative techniques to overcome memory limitations in large-scale LLM systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, but their deployment in datacenter environments faces significant challenges due to the massive memory requirements of key-value (KV) caches. During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\times$ and maintaining accuracy. Our system demonstrates that intelligent memory disaggregation combined with speculative execution can effectively address the memory wall challenge in large-scale LLM serving. Our code implementation has been open-sourced at https://github.com/FastLM/CXL-SpecKV.

Conclusion: AGAPI provides a scalable, transparent foundation for AI-driven materials discovery, enhancing reproducibility and accessibility within the field.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery. AGAPI-Agents codebase is available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/agapi.

### [9] [Hypergame Rationalisability: Solving Agent Misalignment In Strategic Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11942)
*Vince Trencsenyi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a declarative, logic-based language for encoding and solving hypergames, addressing the mismatch in mental models among game-theoretic players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address gaps in hypergame theory by developing a formal representation language and scalable algorithms for use in multi-agent systems, where players can have subjective and divergent interpretations of a game.

Method: The authors developed a declarative domain-specific language grounded in answer-set programming to encode hypergame structures and solutions, including a novel rationalisation procedure for explaining seemingly irrational decisions.

Result: The proposed language provides a formal, unifying framework for hypergames and supports the creation of heterogeneous reasoners with logical guarantees.

Conclusion: The contributions link hypergame theory with multi-agent systems and strategic AI, enabling nuanced reasoning in environments with mismatched beliefs and interpretations.

Abstract: Differences in perception, information asymmetries, and bounded rationality lead game-theoretic players to derive a private, subjective view of the game that may diverge from the underlying ground-truth scenario and may be misaligned with other players' interpretations. While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees. Together, these contributions establish the connection between hypergame theory, multi-agent systems, and strategic AI.

*Anfeng Peng,Ajesh Koyatan Chathoth,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnrichLog, a training-free framework, enriches log entries with contextual knowledge for enhanced anomaly detection in distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional log analysis techniques that lose semantic information or fail to handle ambiguous patterns.

Method: Proposes EnrichLog, combining corpus-specific and sample-specific knowledge using retrieval-augmented generation for anomaly detection without retraining.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show improved detection performance, better handling of ambiguous logs, and efficient inference compared to five baselines.

Conclusion: EnrichLog improves detection accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for practical system monitoring and deployments.

Abstract: System logs are a critical resource for monitoring and managing distributed systems, providing insights into failures and anomalous behavior. Traditional log analysis techniques, including template-based and sequence-driven approaches, often lose important semantic information or struggle with ambiguous log patterns. To address this, we present EnrichLog, a training-free, entry-based anomaly detection framework that enriches raw log entries with both corpus-specific and sample-specific knowledge. EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. The framework leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate relevant contextual knowledge without requiring retraining. We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods. Our results show that EnrichLog consistently improves anomaly detection performance, effectively handles ambiguous log entries, and maintains efficient inference. Furthermore, incorporating both corpus- and sample-specific knowledge enhances model confidence and detection accuracy, making EnrichLog well-suited for practical deployments.

Real-world validation confirms commercial viability with Net Present Cost of -\$122,962 and 69\% cost reduction through renewable energy integration. The framework's unique contribution lies in developing context-aware multi-stakeholder coordination that successfully balances competing objectives while adapting to real-time variables, positioning it as a breakthrough solution for intelligent EV charging coordination and sustainable transportation electrification.

### [12] [The Forecast Critic: Leveraging Large Language Models for Poor Forecast Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12059)
*Luke Bhan,Hanyu Zhang,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Michael W. Mahoney,Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system, The Forecast Critic, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for monitoring the quality of forecasts in retail, demonstrating their ability to detect unreasonable forecasts and leverage contextual data with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability in retail through improved automated forecast monitoring, enabled by the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The study systematically evaluates LLMs' ability to assess forecasting quality via three experiments on synthetic and real-world data, deploying models of various sizes and incorporating unstructured exogenous features for better results.

Result: Key findings show that LLMs reliably identify poor forecasts (F1 score: 0.88), refine results with context (F1 score: 0.84), and identify inaccuracies in real-world datasets, achieving promising yet sub-human performance levels.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as a scalable option for automated forecast evaluation, performing well without domain-specific fine-tuning, although they still slightly lag behind human performance.

Abstract: Monitoring forecasting systems is critical for customer satisfaction, profitability, and operational efficiency in large-scale retail businesses. We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation.

*S. R. Eshwar,Aniruddha Mukherjee,Kintan Saha,Krishna Agarwal,Gugan Thoppe,Aditya Gopalan,Gal Dalal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI), illustrating its robust performance on classical control tasks compared to other deep reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sample inefficiency, training instability, and hyperparameter sensitivity prevalent in deep reinforcement learning methods.

Method: Tested RPI's empirical performance against standard deep RL methods (DQN, Double DQN, DDPG, TD3, PPO) on control tasks like CartPole and Inverted Pendulum.

Result: RPI achieved near-optimal performance early in training and maintained it reliably, outperforming traditional deep RL approaches.

Conclusion: RPI demonstrates strong potential as a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: In a recent work, we proposed Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI), that restores policy iteration's monotonicity-of-value-estimates property to the function approximation setting. Here, we assess the robustness of RPI's empirical performance on two classical control tasks -- CartPole and Inverted Pendulum -- under changes to neural network and environmental parameters. Relative to DQN, Double DQN, DDPG, TD3, and PPO, RPI reaches near-optimal performance early and sustains this policy as training proceeds. Because deep RL methods are often hampered by sample inefficiency, training instability, and hyperparameter sensitivity, our results highlight RPI's promise as a more reliable alternative.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in existing demonstration selection methods for ICL, particularly the lack of label consistency, to enhance performance on NLP tasks.

Method: The authors incorporate a label propagation framework informed by Bayesian perspectives and transductive learning. They propose a data synthesis method combining semantic and label information to ensure label consistency in demonstration selection.

Result: The proposed method, called TopK-SD, improves upon traditional TopK sampling in terms of performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study introduces a new way to understand and improve the mechanism of ICL, focusing on label consistency and leveraging Bayesian principles alongside label synthesis methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform in-context learning (ICL) with minimal supervised examples, which benefits various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One of the critical research focus is the selection of prompt demonstrations. Current approaches typically employ retrieval models to select the top-K most semantically similar examples as demonstrations. However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels. TopK-SD outperforms original TopK sampling on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides a new perspective for understanding the working mechanisms within ICL.

*Aydin Ayanzadeh,Tim Oates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Floorplan2Guide introduces a navigation system utilizing a foundation model for people with visual impairments, transforming floor plans into navigable knowledge graphs and improving navigation accuracy using in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve indoor navigation for visually impaired individuals by overcoming the limitations of current infrastructure-based systems, especially in dynamic environments.

Method: The approach transforms floor plans into navigable knowledge graphs using a foundation model and leverages a large language model (LLM) for spatial information extraction with few-shot learning.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved navigation accuracies of 92.31%, 76.92%, and 61.54% across short, medium, and long routes, respectively, under specific prompting. The graph-based spatial structure improved overall performance by 15.4%.

Conclusion: Graphical representations and in-context learning significantly enhance navigation precision for Blind and Low Vision users, marking a step forward in accessible navigation systems.

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a critical challenge for people with visual impairments. The current solutions mainly rely on infrastructure-based systems, which limit their ability to navigate safely in dynamic environments. We propose a novel navigation approach that utilizes a foundation model to transform floor plans into navigable knowledge graphs and generate human-readable navigation instructions. Floorplan2Guide integrates a large language model (LLM) to extract spatial information from architectural layouts, reducing the manual preprocessing required by earlier floorplan parsing methods. Experimental results indicate that few-shot learning improves navigation accuracy in comparison to zero-shot learning on simulated and real-world evaluations. Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves the highest accuracy among the evaluated models, with 92.31%, 76.92%, and 61.54% on the short, medium, and long routes, respectively, under 5-shot prompting of the MP-1 floor plan. The success rate of graph-based spatial structure is 15.4% higher than that of direct visual reasoning among all models, which confirms that graphical representation and in-context learning enhance navigation performance and make our solution more precise for indoor navigation of Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users.

*Xinyu Gao*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative representation framework for few-shot knowledge graph completion using enhanced attention and a diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art results on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of completing missing facts in knowledge graphs despite the long-tailed distribution of relations and limited samples.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining a two-stage attention triple enhancer with a U-KAN-based diffusion model for effective few-shot knowledge graph completion.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in knowledge graph completion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles few-shot scenarios in knowledge graph completion and improves the performance over prior methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), thanks to their concise and efficient triple-based structure, have been widely applied in intelligent question answering, recommender systems and other domains. However, the heterogeneous and multifaceted nature of real-world data inevitably renders the distribution of relations long-tailed, making it crucial to complete missing facts with limited samples. Previous studies mainly based on metric matching or meta learning, yet they either fail to fully exploit neighborhood information in graph or overlook the distributional characteristics of contrastive signals. In this paper, we re-examine the problem from a perspective of generative representation and propose a few-shot knowledge graph completion framework that integrates two-stage attention triple enhancer with U-KAN based diffusion model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our method achieve new state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified mathematical framework for human cognition, using a geometric approach to explain diverse cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented computational theories of human cognition by proposing a unified framework.

Method: The authors represent cognitive states on a differentiable manifold with a learned Riemannian metric and analyze cognition as Riemannian gradient flow.

Result: The framework explains phenomena like dual-process effects and provides analytical conditions for cognitive regimes, demonstrated via task simulations.

Conclusion: The results propose a geometric foundation for cognition and offer principles for designing general and human-like AI systems.

Abstract: Human cognition spans perception, memory, intuitive judgment, deliberative reasoning, action selection, and social inference, yet these capacities are often explained through distinct computational theories. Here we present a unified mathematical framework in which diverse cognitive processes emerge from a single geometric principle. We represent the cognitive state as a point on a differentiable manifold endowed with a learned Riemannian metric that encodes representational constraints, computational costs, and structural relations among cognitive variables. A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures. We derive analytical conditions for these regimes and demonstrate their behavioural signatures through simulations of canonical cognitive tasks. Together, these results establish a geometric foundation for cognition and suggest guiding principles for the development of more general and human-like artificial intelligence systems.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Wikidata's ontology design, which uses multiple classification axes instead of a singular hierarchy, discussing its structural and practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and evaluate Wikidata's polyhierarchical and multi-axial design in contrast to traditional ontology frameworks.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes Wikidata's ontology structure to highlight its modular, scalable, and collaborative potential.

Result: Wikidata's ontology design allows for flexible, scalable, and collaborative knowledge graph construction, contrasting traditional top-level distinctions.

Conclusion: Wikidata's multi-axial and polyhierarchical approach proves effective for evolving and collaborative knowledge-based systems, differing fundamentally from traditional ontology principles.

Abstract: Traditional ontology design emphasizes disjoint and exhaustive top-level distinctions such as continuant vs. occurrent, abstract vs. concrete, or type vs. instance. These distinctions are used to structure unified hierarchies where every entity is classified under a single upper-level category. Wikidata, by contrast, does not enforce a singular foundational taxonomy. Instead, it accommodates multiple classification axes simultaneously under the shared root class entity. This paper analyzes the structural implications of Wikidata's polyhierarchical and multi-axial design. The Wikidata architecture enables a scalable and modular approach to ontology construction, especially suited to collaborative and evolving knowledge graphs.

*Mahule Roy,Guillaume Lambard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum-aware generative AI framework targeting limitations of materials discovery models rooted in DFT data by incorporating multi-fidelity learning, active validation, and hierarchical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of conventional generative models for materials discovery that rely on approximate DFT data, which fail in strongly correlated systems, creating biases and restricting new discoveries.

Method: Integrated multi-fidelity approach combining diffusion-based generators with quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator leveraging equivariant neural network potentials trained on multi-level theoretical data, plus active learning to address prediction divergences.

Result: Developed a robust AI framework that achieves 3-5x improvement in finding potential stable candidates in challenging material classes compared to single-fidelity DFT-based models.

Conclusion: The framework significantly extends the range and reliability of computational materials discovery, surpassing traditional models and providing insights for addressing systematic limitations in the field.

Abstract: Conventional generative models for materials discovery are predominantly trained and validated using data from Density Functional Theory (DFT) with approximate exchange-correlation functionals. This creates a fundamental bottleneck: these models inherit DFT's systematic failures for strongly correlated systems, leading to exploration biases and an inability to discover materials where DFT predictions are qualitatively incorrect. We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility. This work provides a rigorous, transparent framework for extending the effective search space of computational materials discovery beyond the limitations of single-fidelity models.

### [20] [Entropy Collapse: A Universal Failure Mode of Intelligent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12381)
*Truong Xuan Khanh,Truong Quynh Hoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intelligent systems with increasing intelligence can paradoxically degrade through a process termed 'entropy collapse,' transitioning from adaptive to rigid, low-diversity states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand why highly intelligent systems, despite learning and optimization, become rigid, lose adaptability, or fail across domains such as AI, economics, and evolution.

Method: The authors identify a universal process called entropy collapse, develop a formal framework for this transition, and validate it analytically and via simulations using minimal and general assumptions.

Result: They demonstrate that intelligent systems experience sharp transitions to low-entropy regimes due to bounded novelty regeneration and feedback amplification, with critical thresholds and structural features verified through models and simulations.

Conclusion: The framework explains paradoxical failure in intelligent systems, reframes collapse as a structural cost of intelligence, and encourages the design of entropy-aware principles to sustain adaptability.

Abstract: Intelligent systems are widely assumed to improve through learning, coordination, and optimization. However, across domains -- from artificial intelligence to economic institutions and biological evolution -- increasing intelligence often precipitates paradoxical degradation: systems become rigid, lose adaptability, and fail unexpectedly.
  We identify \emph{entropy collapse} as a universal dynamical failure mode arising when feedback amplification outpaces bounded novelty regeneration. Under minimal domain-agnostic assumptions, we show that intelligent systems undergo a sharp transition from high-entropy adaptive regimes to low-entropy collapsed regimes. Collapse is formalized as convergence toward a stable low-entropy manifold, not a zero-entropy state, implying a contraction of effective adaptive dimensionality rather than loss of activity or scale.
  We analytically establish critical thresholds, dynamical irreversibility, and attractor structure and demonstrate universality across update mechanisms through minimal simulations. This framework unifies diverse phenomena -- model collapse in AI, institutional sclerosis in economics, and genetic bottlenecks in evolution -- as manifestations of the same underlying process.
  By reframing collapse as a structural cost of intelligence, our results clarify why late-stage interventions systematically fail and motivate entropy-aware design principles for sustaining long-term adaptability in intelligent systems.

### [21] [Feeling the Strength but Not the Source: Partial Introspection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12411)
*Ely Hahami,Lavik Jain,Ishaan Sinha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tests Anthropic’s claim on frontier models detecting injected concepts and finds that the ability of introspection is not robust and remains prompt-sensitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The objective is to assess the validity and robustness of Anthropic’s claim that frontier language models detect injected concepts through activation directions, verifying if these capabilities extend to smaller models and under varying conditions.

Method: The authors reproduced Anthropic’s original results with Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, tested its capabilities on related tasks, and explored a contrasting scenario involving classifying the strength of injected concepts.

Result: The study confirms Anthropic’s original findings for concept introspection but shows that the model's performance drops significantly for related tasks or alternative prompts. However, it succeeds in classifying varying strengths of injected concepts with up to 70% accuracy.

Conclusion: Language models appear capable of introspecting their internal representations as earlier claimed; however, this ability is prone to being narrow and sensitive to the choice of the prompt, suggesting limitations in its robustness and generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Recent work from Anthropic claims that frontier models can sometimes detect and name injected "concepts" represented as activation directions. We test the robustness of these claims. First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn "emergent introspection" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models. Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces and validates a 13-item scale to assess critical thinking in AI use, highlighting its importance in verifying and reflecting on AI-generated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for individuals to critically evaluate the growing presence of AI outputs in daily work and learning due to AI's fluency, opacity, and potential for hallucination.

Method: The study spanned six research phases including item generation, validation, structural confirmation, reliability testing, and validation of scale's accuracy via novel AI tasks.

Result: The research confirmed a three-factor model (Verification, Motivation, Reflection) and demonstrated the scale's reliability, validity, and predictive capability in evaluating AI-generated content critically.

Conclusion: The validated scale and task paradigm effectively support understanding and research on critical engagement with generative AI, encouraging responsible AI usage.

Abstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly embedded in everyday work and learning, yet their fluency, opacity, and propensity to hallucinate mean that users must critically evaluate AI outputs rather than accept them at face value. The present research conceptualises critical thinking in AI use as a dispositional tendency to verify the source and content of AI-generated information, to understand how models work and where they fail, and to reflect on the broader implications of relying on AI. Across six studies (N = 1365), we developed and validated the 13-item critical thinking in AI use scale and mapped its nomological network. Study 1 generated and content-validated scale items. Study 2 supported a three-factor structure (Verification, Motivation, and Reflection). Studies 3, 4, and 5 confirmed this higher-order model, demonstrated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, strong factor loadings, sex invariance, and convergent and discriminant validity. Studies 3 and 4 further revealed that critical thinking in AI use was positively associated with openness, extraversion, positive trait affect, and frequency of AI use. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrated criterion validity of the scale, with higher critical thinking in AI use scores predicting more frequent and diverse verification strategies, greater veracity-judgement accuracy in a novel and naturalistic ChatGPT-powered fact-checking task, and deeper reflection about responsible AI. Taken together, the current work clarifies why and how people exercise oversight over generative AI outputs and provides a validated scale and ecologically grounded task paradigm to support theory testing, cross-group, and longitudinal research on critical engagement with generative AI outputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI model documentation is inconsistent and fragmented, hampering reliable assessment of safety and other critical aspects. A standardized transparency framework and automated evaluation pipeline reveal significant compliance and disclosure gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in assessing AI safety claims, data provenance, and changes due to inconsistent and fragmented documentation.

Method: Developed a weighted transparency framework with 8 sections and 23 subsections emphasizing safety-critical disclosures. Used an automated pipeline to extract and score documentation based on completeness.

Result: Evaluated 50 models, identifying systematic gaps in documentation. Frontier labs achieved ~80% compliance, while others fell below 60%, particularly in safety-critical categories such as deception and child safety.

Conclusion: Current AI documentation lacks standardization, inhibiting transparency. A standardized framework can enhance assessment, revealing areas needing significant improvement in safety-related disclosures.

Abstract: AI model documentation is fragmented across platforms and inconsistent in structure, preventing policymakers, auditors, and users from reliably assessing safety claims, data provenance, and version-level changes. We analyzed documentation from five frontier models (Gemini 3, Grok 4.1, Llama 4, GPT-5, and Claude 4.5) and 100 Hugging Face model cards, identifying 947 unique section names with extreme naming variation. Usage information alone appeared under 97 distinct labels. Using the EU AI Act Annex IV and the Stanford Transparency Index as baselines, we developed a weighted transparency framework with 8 sections and 23 subsections that prioritizes safety-critical disclosures (Safety Evaluation: 25%, Critical Risk: 20%) over technical specifications. We implemented an automated multi-agent pipeline that extracts documentation from public sources and scores completeness through LLM-based consensus. Evaluating 50 models across vision, multimodal, open-source, and closed-source systems cost less than $3 in total and revealed systematic gaps. Frontier labs (xAI, Microsoft, Anthropic) achieve approximately 80% compliance, while most providers fall below 60%. Safety-critical categories show the largest deficits: deception behaviors, hallucinations, and child safety evaluations account for 148, 124, and 116 aggregate points lost, respectively, across all evaluated models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaHGNIE, a framework to improve node importance estimation (NIE) in heterogeneous knowledge graphs by utilizing meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of neglecting high-order dependencies and ineffective integration of structural and semantic data in existing NIE methods.

Method: MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order graph using meta-paths with hyperedges for multi-entity contexts. It employs a hypergraph transformer for semantic encoding, local attention for structural aggregation, and multimodal fusion under contrastive learning for robust cross-modal alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MetaHGNIE surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark NIE datasets, effectively modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignments.

Conclusion: MetaHGNIE's design of explicitly modeling high-order relations and integrating structural/semantic data enhances performance in heterogeneous knowledge graphs, marking a significant step forward in NIE research.

Abstract: Node importance estimation (NIE) in heterogeneous knowledge graphs is a critical yet challenging task, essential for applications such as recommendation, knowledge reasoning, and question answering. Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignment in heterogeneous knowledge graphs.

TL;DR: The paper presents SafeGen, a framework to embed ethical safeguards into text-to-image generation systems, addressing societal biases and misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reconcile creative freedom with ethical concerns in text-to-image AI systems, given issues like societal biases, misinformation, and intellectual property violations.

Method: SafeGen integrates BGE-M3 (a text classifier filtering unsafe prompts) and Hyper-SD (an optimized image diffusion model). Both modules are trained using a curated and fairness-aware multilingual dataset.

Result: Quantitative metrics show high performance with Hyper-SD achieving IS = 3.52, FID = 22.08, SSIM = 0.79, and BGE-M3 achieving an F1-Score of 0.81, alongside validation with ablation studies.

Conclusion: SafeGen bridges the gap between ethical responsibility and creative output in text-to-image applications, illustrating practical impacts in education, academia, and bias mitigation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented opportunities for creative expression, education, and research. Text-to-image systems such as DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney can now convert ideas into visuals within seconds, but they also present a dual-use dilemma, raising critical ethical concerns: amplifying societal biases, producing high-fidelity disinformation, and violating intellectual property. This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow. Quantitative evaluations confirm its effectiveness, with Hyper-SD achieving IS = 3.52, FID = 22.08, and SSIM = 0.79, while BGE-M3 reaches an F1-Score of 0.81. An ablation study further validates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for both modules. Case studies illustrate SafeGen's practical impact in blocking unsafe prompts, generating inclusive teaching materials, and reinforcing academic integrity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces KidsArtBench, a benchmark focused on evaluating children's artwork with multi-dimensional expert annotations and employs a novel multi-LoRA method with RAFT to improve assessment accuracy. Significant advancements in evaluation correlation and pedagogically meaningful outcomes are demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in evaluating artistic expressions in children's artwork using MLLMs, emphasizing the lack of datasets and methodologies for abstract aesthetic concepts and multi-dimensional feedback aligned with educational needs.

Method: The authors developed KidsArtBench, a benchmark with annotated children's artwork, pairing multi-dimensional rubric-aligned annotations with expert comments. They also proposed an attribute-specific multi-LoRA approach combined with Regression-Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT) for better alignment of model predictions with ordinal evaluation scales.

Result: Their approach increased the correlation between model predictions and human annotations from 0.468 to 0.653 on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with improvements in perceptual and higher-order attributes, validating the efficacy of their method.

Conclusion: Educator-aligned supervision and attribute-specific training can significantly improve the evaluation of children's artwork, providing a robust framework and resources for fostering progress in educational AI applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable progress across many visual-language tasks; however, their capacity to evaluate artistic expression remains limited. Aesthetic concepts are inherently abstract and open-ended, and multimodal artwork annotations are scarce. We introduce KidsArtBench, a new benchmark of over 1k children's artworks (ages 5-15) annotated by 12 expert educators across 9 rubric-aligned dimensions, together with expert comments for feedback. Unlike prior aesthetic datasets that provide single scalar scores on adult imagery, KidsArtBench targets children's artwork and pairs multi-dimensional annotations with comment supervision to enable both ordinal assessment and formative feedback. Building on this resource, we propose an attribute-specific multi-LoRA approach, where each attribute corresponds to a distinct evaluation dimension (e.g., Realism, Imagination) in the scoring rubric, with Regression-Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to align predictions with ordinal scales. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our method increases correlation from 0.468 to 0.653, with the largest gains on perceptual dimensions and narrowed gaps on higher-order attributes. These results show that educator-aligned supervision and attribute-aware training yield pedagogically meaningful evaluations and establish a rigorous testbed for sustained progress in educational AI. We release data and code with ethics documentation.

*Yesid Fonseca,Manuel S. Ríos,Nicanor Quijano,Luis F. Giraldo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study shows that artificial foragers with learned world models align with optimal foraging strategies and support adaptive, interpretable AI based on ecological principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the computational mechanisms that enable optimal patch-foraging behaviors in biological foragers, which remains an open question.

Method: The researchers used model-based reinforcement learning agents to examine how predictive capabilities influence patch-leaving decisions, comparing these agents to model-free reinforcement learning agents.

Result: Model-based agents, driven by predictive world models, demonstrated convergence to strategies in alignment with the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), showing similarities to biological foraging behaviors.

Conclusion: Predictive world models facilitate more interpretable, explainable, and biologically grounded decision-making in AI, advancing adaptive AI guided by ecological optimality principles.

Abstract: Patch foraging involves the deliberate and planned process of determining the optimal time to depart from a resource-rich region and investigate potentially more beneficial alternatives. The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is frequently used to characterize this process, offering an optimality model for such foraging behaviors. Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems. Overall, our findings highlight the value of ecological optimality principles for advancing interpretable and adaptive AI.

### [28] [Large Language Newsvendor: Decision Biases and Cognitive Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12552)
*Jifei Liu,Zhi Chen,Yuanguang Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA-8B replicate and amplify human cognitive biases in decision-making contexts, especially in supply chain management. Efficient, simpler models (e.g., GPT-4o) can outperform more complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the potential risks posed by LLMs in amplifying human biases during high-stakes operational tasks, highlighting the need for responsible AI use in decision-making.

Method: Dynamic, multi-round experiments tested established decision biases in LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B) using the newsvendor problem in a supply chain context.

Result: LLMs exhibited ordering biases and amplified other cognitive tendencies, with GPT-4 being more irrational despite its intelligence, while GPT-4o was near-optimal.

Conclusion: Human oversight and structured prompts are necessary to constrain biases in AI-driven decisions. Choosing efficiency-optimized models over complex ones can improve decision reliability.

Abstract: Problem definition: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into business decision making, their potential to replicate and even amplify human cognitive biases cautions a significant, yet not well-understood, risk. This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions.

### [29] [AgentSHAP: Interpreting LLM Agent Tool Importance with Monte Carlo Shapley Value Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12597)
*Miriam Horovicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentSHAP, a framework to explain tool importance in LLM agents using Shapley values from game theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a method that provides explainability on the contribution of external tools used by LLM agents, as existing XAI methods lack capability for tool-level explanations.

Method: The framework uses Monte Carlo Shapley values to test agent responses with varying tool subsets, computing fair importance scores without needing access to internal weights or gradients, and reduces computational costs significantly.

Result: Empirical results on API-Bank show AgentSHAP yields consistent scores, identifies relevant tools, and distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant tools, making it effective for tool-level explanation.

Conclusion: AgentSHAP establishes itself as the first practical framework for explaining tool importance in LLM agents, alongside TokenSHAP and PixelSHAP, broadening explainability approaches for generative AI.

Abstract: LLM agents that use external tools can solve complex tasks, but understanding which tools actually contributed to a response remains a blind spot. No existing XAI methods address tool-level explanations. We introduce AgentSHAP, the first framework for explaining tool importance in LLM agents. AgentSHAP is model-agnostic: it treats the agent as a black box and works with any LLM (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) without needing access to internal weights or gradients. Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools. AgentSHAP joins TokenSHAP (for tokens) and PixelSHAP (for image regions) to complete a family of Shapley-based XAI tools for modern generative AI. Code: https://github.com/GenAISHAP/TokenSHAP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobiBench is introduced as a modular and multi-path offline benchmarking tool for mobile GUI agents, overcoming limitations in current evaluation methods and enabling scalable and reproducible assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to evaluate mobile GUI agents face scalability and reproducibility issues in online settings and penalize alternative valid actions in offline single-path evaluations.

Method: MobiBench provides a modular framework for offline benchmarking that considers multiple valid paths and focuses on evaluating individual components systematically.

Result: MobiBench achieves high human evaluator agreement (94.72%) and provides module-level insights on techniques, configurations, limitations of LFMs, and design guidelines.

Conclusion: MobiBench offers a significant step towards fair, efficient, and reproducible evaluation of mobile GUI agents with insights for their improvement.

Abstract: Mobile GUI Agents, AI agents capable of interacting with mobile applications on behalf of users, have the potential to transform human computer interaction. However, current evaluation practices for GUI agents face two fundamental limitations. First, they either rely on single path offline benchmarks or online live benchmarks. Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we present MobiBench, the first modular and multi path aware offline benchmarking framework for mobile GUI agents that enables high fidelity, scalable, and reproducible evaluation entirely in offline settings. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks. Furthermore, our comprehensive module level analysis uncovers several key insights, including a systematic evaluation of diverse techniques used in mobile GUI agents, optimal module configurations across model scales, the inherent limitations of current LFMs, and actionable guidelines for designing more capable and cost efficient mobile agents.

*Samarth Sarin,Lovepreet Singh,Bhaskarjit Sarmah,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memoria is a framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) with a memory system enabling consistency, personalization, and long-term user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for LLMs to maintain continuity and user personalization over extended interactive sessions is critical for creating adaptive and practical AI systems.

Method: Memoria utilizes a hybrid memory system comprising session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph for dynamic user modeling.

Result: Memoria enables LLM-based conversational systems to achieve both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while respecting token constraints.

Conclusion: Memoria bridges the gap between traditional stateless LLMs and memory-enabled systems, making scalable personalized conversational AI feasible for industry applications.

Abstract: Agentic memory is emerging as a key enabler for large language models (LLM) to maintain continuity, personalization, and long-term context in extended user interactions, critical capabilities for deploying LLMs as truly interactive and adaptive agents. Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences.

### [33] [WebOperator: Action-Aware Tree Search for Autonomous Agents in Web Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12692)
*Mahir Labib Dihan,Tanzima Hashem,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces WebOperator, a tree-search framework for LLM-based agents in web environments, addressing the challenges of lack of foresight and irreversible actions through strategic exploration and robust backtracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address limitations in LLM-based agents operating in web environments, specifically their inability to consider long-term consequences and safely navigate errors or irreversible actions.

Method: The method involves the development of WebOperator, which uses best-first search ranking actions by reward and safety, robust backtracking mechanisms, diverse reasoning contexts for action generation, and pre-execution filtering of invalid actions.

Result: Experimental results show that WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate on WebArena, demonstrating its effectiveness in web exploration tasks.

Conclusion: WebOperator showcases significant improvements in strategic foresight and safe execution for LLM-based agents, making it highly effective for realistic web environments.

Abstract: LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMART, a framework utilizing LLMs and reinforcement learning for game testing, achieving high code coverage and task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing structural verification and functional validation in automated game testing under the "Games as a Service" model.

Method: SMART integrates structural verification using AST analysis and functional validation using reinforcement learning agents guided by LLM-based hybrid rewards.

Result: SMART achieved over 94% branch coverage of modified code and a 98% task completion rate in Overcooked and Minecraft environments.

Conclusion: SMART effectively bridges the gap between code-centric and player-centric testing methods, enhancing automated game testing for frequent content updates.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of the "Games as a Service" model necessitates frequent content updates, placing immense pressure on quality assurance. In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence. However, existing automated testing approaches typically create a dichotomy: code-centric methods focus on structural coverage without understanding gameplay context, while player-centric agents validate high-level intent but often fail to cover specific underlying code changes. To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness.

*Syeda Zunaira Ahmed,Hejab Tahira Beg,Maryam Khalid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning framework using demographic-aware data augmentation to improve Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction for 5G video streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in QoE prediction approaches, which rely on limited datasets and assume uniform user perception, thereby limiting their effectiveness in diverse environments.

Method: The authors propose demographic-aware data augmentation to expand a QoE dataset by six times, combined with the evaluation of classical and deep learning models including TabNet and an attention-based MLP.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in QoE prediction accuracy, with TabNet outperforming other models due to its feature selection and attention capabilities.

Conclusion: Demographic-aware augmentation enhances QoE prediction accuracy and scalability, paving the way for personalized intelligence in 5G video streaming networks.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction is a critical component of modern multimedia systems, particularly for adaptive video streaming in 5G networks. Accurate QoE estimation enables intelligent resource management and supports user centric service delivery. Existing QoE prediction approaches primarily rely on limited datasets and assume uniform user perception, which restricts their applicability in heterogeneous real world environments.
  This paper proposes a demographic aware machine learning framework for personalized QoE prediction. We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation. Using the augmented dataset, we evaluate a comprehensive set of classical machine learning models alongside advanced deep learning architectures, including an attention-based MLP and TabNet.
  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy across RMSE, MAE, and R metrics compared to baseline models. Among all evaluated approaches, TabNet achieves the strongest performance, benefiting from its inherent feature selection and attention mechanisms. The results confirm that demographic-aware augmentation substantially enhances QoE prediction robustness and provides a scalable direction for personalized QoE-aware intelligence in 5G video streaming networks.

### [36] [Causal Counterfactuals Reconsidered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12804)
*Sander Beckers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a generalized semantics for probabilities of counterfactuals applicable to probabilistic causal models beyond Pearl's standard framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in Pearl's semantics, particularly its inability to handle simple probabilistic causal models that cannot be extended into structural causal models.

Method: The method involves constructing semantics that apply to Markov-condition-satisfying causal models with realistic variables and causal completeness while avoiding universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables.

Result: The semantics proposed reconcile conflicting viewpoints between Pearl and Dawid and prove equivalence to other recent proposals while aligning with broader stochastic counterfactual literature.

Conclusion: The study enhances the theoretical understanding of counterfactuals and causal abstractions, offering a balanced perspective that rejects determinism but permits universal general semantics.

Abstract: I develop a novel semantics for probabilities of counterfactuals that generalizes the standard Pearlian semantics: it applies to probabilistic causal models that cannot be extended into realistic structural causal models and are therefore beyond the scope of Pearl's semantics. This generalization is needed because, as I show, such probabilistic causal models arise even in simple settings. My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly. Throughout I also reflect on the universality of the Markov condition and explore a novel generalization of causal abstractions

*Boyang Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework for mitigating safety risks of autonomous use in Large Language Models (LLMs), promising high intervention success and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from addressing safety risks inherent in autonomous LLMs, particularly destructive commands and operational inconsistency, while overcoming latency challenges posed by traditional safety mechanisms or commercial systems.

Method: The method involves designing a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework with a policy-based interception layer and transactional filesystem snapshots to ensure safe agent actions without breaking autonomy.

Result: The experiments evidenced a 100% interception rate for harmful actions and complete rollback success for failed states, with only 14.5% performance overhead (approx. 1.8s per transaction).

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms conventional solutions by ensuring safety in autonomous LLM operations without sacrificing efficiency or requiring interactive authentication, enabling smoother workflows.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive code generators to autonomous agents introduces significant safety risks, specifically regarding destructive commands and inconsistent system states. Existing commercial solutions often prioritize interactive user safety, enforcing authentication barriers that break the headless loops required for true autonomy. This paper presents a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework designed to mitigate these risks through a policy-based interception layer and a transactional filesystem snapshot mechanism. We hypothesize that wrapping agent actions in atomic transactions can guarantee safety with acceptable latency, outperforming the heavy initialization overhead of containers or the interactive friction of commercial CLIs. We validated this approach by deploying the Minimind-MoE LLM served via nano-vllm on a custom Proxmox-based testbed utilizing EVPN/VXLAN isolation. Experimental results demonstrate a 100\% interception rate for high-risk commands and a 100\% success rate in rolling back failed states. Crucially, our prototype incurs only a 14.5\% performance overhead (approx. 1.8s) per transaction. In contrast, benchmarking against the Gemini CLI sandbox revealed that it requires interactive authentication ("Sign in"), rendering it unusable for headless, autonomous agent workflows.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), introducing improved memory management for generative agents with enhanced performance, privacy, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative agents face challenges with memory management, leading to computational inefficiencies and privacy concerns, or simplistic forgetting methods that degrade functionality.

Method: Introduces MaRS with six forgetting policies and evaluates performance using the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark across multiple metrics.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows superior performance of the hybrid forgetting policy (composite score: 0.911) with computational and privacy benefits.

Conclusion: The research contributes to human-centered AI by providing actionable guidelines and setting benchmarks for deploying memory-efficient, privacy-sensitive generative agents.

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly sophisticated and deployed in long-term interactive scenarios, their memory management capabilities emerge as a critical bottleneck for both performance and privacy. Current approaches either maintain unlimited memory stores, leading to computational intractability and privacy concerns, or employ simplistic forgetting mechanisms that compromise agent coherence and functionality. This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments. The theoretical foundations, implementation framework, and empirical results contribute to the emerging field of human-centered AI by addressing fundamental challenges in agent memory management that directly impact user trust, system scalability, and regulatory compliance.

*Nijesh Upreti,Vaishak Belle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a modular approach combining PyGol (an ILP system) with the Z3 SMT solver to enable learning hybrid rules incorporating numerical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of classical ILP systems in handling and reasoning with numerical constraints by integrating ILP with SMT solvers.

Method: The authors use PyGol to propose candidate clauses that are interpreted by the Z3 SMT solver as quantifier-free formulas over background theories. This allows the system to introduce numerical parameters while maintaining ILP's symbolic structure.

Result: The system successfully demonstrates the ability to learn hybrid rules with numerical constraints across synthetic datasets designed to test diverse reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: A modular SMT-ILP architecture effectively enhances the expressiveness of symbolic rule learning, complementing existing numerical ILP methods and paving the way for future work in this domain.

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides interpretable rule learning in relational domains, yet remains limited in its ability to induce and reason with numerical constraints. Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction.

Motivation: Forensic sciences are prone to errors and need systemic improvements to ensure reliable outcomes in digital forensic investigations.

Method: A schema of an AI model for digital forensics, based on state-of-the-art practices, is proposed to enhance reliability and transparency.

Result: The paper outlines a framework that integrates human-readable artifacts and open standards, aiming to reduce complexity and error vulnerability.

Abstract: The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital forensics (DF) is becoming increasingly complex, ubiquitous, and pervasive, with overlapping techniques and technologies being adopted in all types of scientific and technical inquiry. Despite incredible advances, forensic sciences are not exempt from errors and remain vulnerable to fallibility. To mitigate the limitations of errors in DF, the systemic complexity is identified and addressed with the adoption of human-readable artifacts and open standards. A DF AI model schema based on the state of the art is outlined.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses policy collapse issues in self-supervised reinforcement learning for LLMs, introducing M-GRPO and an entropy-based IQR filtering technique to tackle instability and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs using self-supervised RL while avoiding the dependency on human-labeled data and addressing policy collapse in long-horizon training.

Method: Proposes the M-GRPO framework with a momentum model for stability and an IQR-based adaptive filtering method to maintain policy diversity and prevent entropy collapse.

Result: Demonstrates that both M-GRPO and IQR filtering achieved improved training stability and state-of-the-art performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining M-GRPO and IQR filtering resolves instability issues, ensuring stable training and leading to superior RL performance for LLM reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without reliance on expensive human-annotated data. However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a "policy collapse" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates student-led querying strategies in Large Language Models for dynamic learning, showing measurable improvement in benchmarks using guided training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in dynamic interaction capabilities of LLMs, where agents must acquire knowledge through active engagement rather than relying solely on static knowledge retrieval.

Method: It introduces student-led interaction strategies and employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for training models to ask targeted questions for effective learning.

Result: Student-led approaches show consistent improvements (absolute Pass@k gains of at least 0.5) over static models across math and coding benchmarks. Additionally, guided DPO training enhances the question quality and learning efficiency for smaller models.

Conclusion: Student-centric approaches and guided training significantly improve learning outcomes and dynamic adaptability in LLMs, highlighting the importance of active knowledge acquisition processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at static interactions, where they answer user queries by retrieving knowledge encoded in their parameters. However, in many real-world settings, such as educational tutoring or medical assistance, relevant information is not directly available and must be actively acquired through dynamic interactions. An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.

### [43] [Towards Unified Co-Speech Gesture Generation via Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13131)
*Xin Guo,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in generating realistic 3D body movements from speech by proposing a framework called Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) that better models correlations between motion units like the head, body, and hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current methods for generating realistic and coordinated co-speech gestures by better modeling inter- and intra-motion unit correlations.

Method: The authors propose HIP, which employs periodic autoencoders for disentangling complex motion dynamics and a hierarchical framework for modeling interrelations among the face, body, and hands during 3D gesture generation.

Result: The proposed HIP approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments for realistic and coordinated co-speech gesture generation.

Conclusion: The HIP method effectively addresses the problem of generating natural and coordinated 3D gestures from speech, demonstrating superior performance and advancing the state-of-the-art in this field.

Abstract: Generating 3D-based body movements from speech shows great potential in extensive downstream applications, while it still suffers challenges in imitating realistic human movements. Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Code and models will be publicly available.

*Anika Sharma,Malavika Mampally,Chidaksh Ravuru,Kandyce Brennan,Neil Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models' ability to understand abortion stigma across cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels, finding significant deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address whether large language models can genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena, specifically abortion stigma, which is crucial as these models increasingly influence high-stakes decisions.

Method: Researchers tested 627 diverse personas across five leading language models using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS) to analyze coherence in representing stigma across three levels: cognitive, interpersonal, and structural.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs fail to demonstrate genuine understanding: they overestimate interpersonal stigma, underestimate cognitive stigma, introduce demographic biases absent in human data, miss the stigma-secrecy relationship, and show contradictions across theoretical constructs.

Conclusion: Current alignment approaches ensure appropriate technical language use but fail to achieve coherent multilevel understanding of psychological phenomena; new design, evaluation, and governance methods are necessary for AI safety in sensitive domains.

Abstract: As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.

### [45] [MAC: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interactive User Clarification in Multi-turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13154)
*Emre Can Acikgoz,Jinoh Oh,Joo Hyuk Jeon,Jie Hao,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur,Xiang Li,Chengyuan Ma,Xing Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification) framework that improves the resolution of ambiguous user requests in multi-agent conversational settings, showing enhanced communication and task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolving user ambiguities in multi-agent conversational systems is critical for task success, yet remains a challenge due to the complexity of assigning roles and planning clarifications among agents.

Method: The paper proposes MAC, an interactive framework including a taxonomy of user ambiguities and a strategy to coordinate multiple agents for resolving ambiguities efficiently.

Result: The MAC framework led to a 7.8% increase in task success rates and reduced dialogue turns (from 6.53 to 4.86) on the MultiWOZ 2.4 dataset by improving clarification processes.

Conclusion: Employing role-aware and interactive clarification in multi-agent systems enhances reliability and communication efficiency in human-agent interactions.

Abstract: Conversational agents often encounter ambiguous user requests, requiring an effective clarification to successfully complete tasks. While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication.

*Emre Can Acikgoz,Jinoh Oh,Jie Hao,Joo Hyuk Jeon,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur,Xiang Li,Chengyuan Ma,Xing Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning framework to improve collaboration between humans and AI by enhancing agents' conversational capabilities for clarification and task-adaptiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-agent collaborations mostly involve agents passively following instructions with minimal clarifications or adaptiveness. This misses the opportunity to leverage agents' growing conversational capabilities for proactive engagement and ambiguity resolution.

Method: Introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning method that trains agents to ask effective clarification questions using rewards. Support this training with SpeakER, a synthetic dataset emphasizing interactive dialogue scenarios. Propose a systematic reward design to balance proactive conversations without excessive length.

Result: SpeakRL achieves a 20.14% task completion improvement compared to baseline models, outperforming even larger proprietary models, without increasing conversation complexity.

Conclusion: Encouraging proactive dialogues through methods like SpeakRL makes agents more effective collaborators. Clarification-centric conversations significantly improve task outcomes while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration is increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Finch, a benchmark to evaluate AI on complex, real-world finance and accounting workflows involving tasks like data entry, modeling, validation, and more, sourced from authentic enterprise data. Frontier AI systems struggle to perform well on these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a standardized benchmark for assessing AI's ability to handle the complex, messy workflows of real-world enterprise settings in finance and accounting, highlighting areas for improvement in AI systems.

Method: The authors use LLM-assisted discovery combined with expert annotations to derive and meticulously annotate workflows from authentic enterprise data, including email threads and spreadsheet histories, resulting in 172 workflows with 384 tasks.

Result: AI systems like GPT 5.1 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 perform poorly on these workflows, with pass rates of only 38.4% and 25.0%, respectively. This highlights significant challenges in handling enterprise-grade tasks.

Conclusion: Finch exposes the limitations of current AI models in tackling complex, real-world finance and accounting workflows, underscoring the need for advancements in AI systems tailored for these domains.

Abstract: We introduce a finance & accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.
  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.
  We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 48 hours in total yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents.

### [48] [Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO): Enhancing On-Policy Alignment via Hint-Guided Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13240)
*Zihui Zhao,Zechang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO) enhances Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for aligning large language and vision-language models by incorporating hint-guided reflections, addressing weak learning signals resulting from similar errors in preference pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which suffers from weak learning signals due to similar errors in preference pairs, causing slow and unstable convergence in alignment tasks.

Method: RPO introduces reflective hints generated by external models to identify hallucination sources and create more contrastive preference pairs. The method leverages mutual information to strengthen learning signals while staying within the same policy distribution.

Result: Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO) achieves better alignment with fewer samples and iterations, decreases hallucination rates, and provides state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: RPO represents an effective advancement over DPO, improving convergence, sample efficiency, and general model alignment performance while maintaining stability.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a lightweight and effective alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) for aligning large language and vision-language models. However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents MedInsightBench, a benchmark for evaluating large multi-modal models' abilities to analyze medical data, and introduces MedInsightAgent, which improves performance in deriving actionable medical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of specialized high-quality benchmarks designed to evaluate LMMs' ability to derive actionable insights from complex, multi-modal medical datasets.

Method: This paper develops MedInsightBench, a dataset containing 332 annotated medical cases, and introduces MedInsightAgent, a framework with three modules designed to enhance LMMs' medical data analysis capabilities.

Result: Results reveal existing LMMs struggle to perform well on MedInsightBench, but MedInsightAgent improves their performance in multi-modal medical data analysis.

Conclusion: MedInsightAgent, alongside MedInsightBench, fills a significant gap in medical AI by offering tools to evaluate and enhance LMMs in extracting deep insights from medical datasets.

Abstract: In medical data analysis, extracting deep insights from complex, multi-modal datasets is essential for improving patient care, increasing diagnostic accuracy, and optimizing healthcare operations. However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to build industrial AI agents that perform accurate arithmetic on tabular data while maintaining data privacy and operating on secured, on-premises systems.

Method: The paper uses an error-driven optimization framework to iteratively refine prompt-rules for accurate arithmetic reasoning in a small language model (Qwen3 4B).

Result: The proposed method significantly improves the small language model’s arithmetic accuracy to 70.8%, even outperforming larger models like GPT-3.5 Turbo in privacy-compliant scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that small models can outperform larger ones in secure environments through systematic prompt-rule optimization, offering reliable and privacy-compliant AI solutions for regulated industries.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in industrial agents capable of supporting analysts in regulated sectors, such as finance and healthcare, within tabular data workflows. A key capability for such systems is performing accurate arithmetic operations on structured data while ensuring sensitive information never leaves secure, on-premises environments. Here, we introduce an error-driven optimization framework for arithmetic reasoning that enhances a Code Generation Agent (CGA), specifically applied to on-premises small language models (SLMs). Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\%. Our results suggest that developing reliable, interpretable, and industrially deployable AI assistants can be achieved not only through costly fine-tuning but also via systematic, error-driven prompt optimization, enabling small models to surpass larger language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in a privacy-compliant manner.

*Francesca Da Ros,Luca Di Gaspero,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether these representations can support decision tasks such as algorithm selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the internal representations learned by LLMs capture structural information of combinatorial optimization problems that can inform downstream tasks.

Method: A twofold methodology was used. Direct querying assessed LLMs' ability to explicitly extract instance features, and probing analyses examined information implicitly encoded in hidden layers. The probing approach was applied to an algorithm selection task across four benchmark problems and three representations.

Result: LLMs demonstrated moderate feature recovery capability via querying and probing. Their hidden-layer representations performed comparably to traditional feature extraction for predicting best solvers, showing they captured relevant problem structures.

Conclusion: LLMs encode meaningful structural information for combinatorial optimization problems, with their representations supporting tasks like algorithm selection effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new perspectives for automation in optimization. While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DERL, a bilevel framework for optimizing reward functions in reinforcement learning, which achieves state-of-the-art results in various domains by leveraging differentiable meta-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning and the limitations of existing automated methods that fail to consider causal relationships between reward structures and task performance.

Method: The DERL framework uses a Meta-Optimizer to evolve reward functions by composing structured primitives and employs differentiable reinforcement learning for meta-optimization, effectively learning from task success signals through a novel meta-gradient approach.

Result: DERL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in ALFWorld and ScienceWorld and significantly outperforms heuristic-based methods, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios. It also captures intrinsic task structures, improving agent alignment autonomously.

Conclusion: DERL effectively bridges the gap between reward structure and performance, offering a powerful approach for autonomous reward and task optimization in reinforcement learning without requiring human intervention.

Abstract: The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the "meta-gradient" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates envy-like behavior in large language models (LLMs) across scenarios like competitive games and workplace settings, highlighting variations in behavior among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether LLMs, which increasingly participate in human-like collaborative and competitive settings, exhibit envy-like behaviors, and under what circumstances.

Method: The study evaluates envy-like preferences in LLMs using two scenarios: a point allocation game testing competitiveness and a workplace setting assessing reactions to unfair recognition.

Result: It finds evidence of envy-like patterns in specific LLMs, with behaviors varying significantly. For example, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show competitiveness by lowering peers' outcomes, while Mistral-Small-3.2-24B prioritizes individual gains.

Conclusion: There is a need to account for competitive tendencies when designing and ensuring the safety of LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To respond to criticisms that hierarchical case-based reasoning models can yield incorrect outcomes and fail to account for varying strengths of intermediate factors.

Method: The authors reassess examples criticized by Bench-Capon, applying van Woerkom’s dimension-based hierarchical result models to address the issues raised.

Result: The application of dimension-based versions of hierarchical models resolves some of the criticisms presented by Bench-Capon.

Conclusion: Van Woerkom's model successfully addresses some of the challenges highlighted by Bench-Capon when intermediate factors are treated as dimensions.

Abstract: In recent years, hierarchical case-based-reasoning models of precedential constraint have been proposed. In various papers, Trevor Bench-Capon criticised these models on the grounds that they would give incorrect outcomes in some cases. In particular, the models would not account for the possibility that intermediate factors are established with different strengths by different base-level factors. In this paper we respond to these criticisms for van Woerkom's result-based hierarchical models. We argue that in some examples Bench-Capon seems to interpret intermediate factors as dimensions, and that applying van Woerkom's dimension-based version of the hierarchical result model to these examples avoids Bench-Capon's criticisms.

TL;DR: MedCEG introduces a framework to enhance medical language models' reasoning accuracy using Critical Evidence Graphs (CEG), outperforming existing methods in reliability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical reasoning models lack focus on the validity and accuracy of their reasoning pathways during training, vital for clinical reliability.

Method: MedCEG combines supervised reasoning pathways captured in Critical Evidence Graphs and a novel Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward to ensure evidence-based reasoning.

Result: MedCEG achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, producing clinically valid reasoning chains with improved quality and reliability.

Conclusion: MedCEG contributes to medical AI by advancing reasoning reliability, utilizing structured evidence-based pathways for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models with reasoning capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of domains. In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making. While reinforcement learning has effectively enhanced reasoning performance in medical contexts, the clinical reliability of these reasoning processes remains limited because their accuracy and validity are often overlooked during training. To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality. Experimental results show that MedCEG surpasses existing methods in performance while producing clinically valid reasoning chains, representing a solid advancement in reliable medical AI reasoning.

Motivation: To develop an energy-efficient, low-latency solution for resource-constrained edge devices to perform on-device few-shot learning efficiently.

Method: FSL-HDnn integrates a resource-efficient feature extractor using weight clustering and a fast few-shot learning classifier based on hyperdimensional computing. Optimization strategies include early-exit mechanisms and batched single-pass training.

Result: The proposed chip, fabricated using 40 nm CMOS process, achieves 6 mJ/image energy efficiency, 28 images/s training throughput, and reduces training latency by 2x to 20.9x compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: FSL-HDnn demonstrates that energy-efficient and low-latency on-device learning is achievable, providing significant improvements both in hardware utilization and performance for edge applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces FSL-HDnn, an energy-efficient accelerator that implements the end-to-end pipeline of feature extraction and on-device few-shot learning (FSL). The accelerator addresses fundamental challenges of on-device learning (ODL) for resource-constrained edge applications through two synergistic modules: a parameter-efficient feature extractor employing weight clustering and an FSL classifier based on hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The feature extractor exploits the weight clustering mechanism to reduce computational complexity, while the HDC-based FSL classifier eliminates gradient-based back propagation operations, enabling single-pass training with substantially reduced latency. Additionally, FSL-HDnn enables low-latency ODL and inference via two proposed optimization strategies, including an early-exit mechanism with branch feature extraction and batched single-pass training that improves hardware utilization. Measurement results demonstrate that our chip fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS process delivers superior training energy efficiency of 6 mJ/image and end-to-end training throughput of 28 images/s on a 10-way 5-shot FSL task. The end-to-end training latency is also reduced by 2x to 20.9x compared to state-of-the-art ODL chips.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inflexible commodity DRAM architectures cannot universally address the diverse needs of applications such as HPC, graphics, and machine learning, necessitating customizable 3D die-stacked DRAM solutions.

Method: DreamRAM provides fine-grained parameter customization at multiple architectural levels, models wire and routing tradeoffs, and incorporates a custom MAT-level routing scheme, Dataline-Over-MAT. It has been calibrated against industry designs.

Result: DreamRAM discovered designs offering up to 66% higher bandwidth, 100% higher capacity, and 45% lower power per bit, highlighting the potential for significant optimization.

Conclusion: DreamRAM demonstrates the ability to identify tailored DRAM designs addressing specific application requirements, leveraging the flexibility of 3D stacking and advanced modeling techniques.

Abstract: 3D die-stacked DRAM has emerged as a key technology for delivering high bandwidth and high density for applications such as high-performance computing, graphics, and machine learning. However, different applications place diverse and sometimes diverging demands on power, performance, and area that cannot be universally satisfied with fixed commodity DRAM designs. Die stacking creates the opportunity for a large DRAM design space through 3D integration and expanded total die area. To open and navigate this expansive design space of customized memory architectures that cater to application-specific needs, we introduce DreamRAM, a configurable bandwidth, capacity, energy, latency, and area modeling tool for custom 3D die-stacked DRAM designs. DreamRAM exposes fine-grained design customization parameters at the MAT, subarray, bank, and inter-bank levels, including extensions of partial page and subarray parallelism proposals found in the literature, to open a large previously-unexplored design space. DreamRAM analytically models wire pitch, width, length, capacitance, and scaling parameters to capture the performance tradeoffs of physical layout and routing design choices. Routing awareness enables DreamRAM to model a custom MAT-level routing scheme, Dataline-Over-MAT (DLOMAT), to facilitate better bandwidth tradeoffs. DreamRAM is calibrated and validated against published industry HBM3 and HBM2E designs. Within DreamRAM's rich design space, we identify designs that achieve each of 66% higher bandwidth, 100% higher capacity, and 45% lower power and energy per bit compared to the baseline design, each on an iso-bandwidth, iso-capacity, and iso-power basis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in memory usage, data transfer, and energy consumption in neural network accelerators while maintaining fine-tuning flexibility and high throughput for stable model parameters.

Method: Implement a hardware-based accelerator using power-of-two weight quantization to replace multiplications with additions, integrating most layers directly in the hardware and including a reprogrammable final layer for fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrated a 20x improvement in throughput over GPUs for MobileNetV2 with fine-tuning capabilities, achieving up to 67x throughput increase when fine-tuning is not needed, processing up to 4 million images per second.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture is highly effective for energy-efficient, high-throughput inference in edge and data center applications, achieving significant improvements in speed and power efficiency with balanced fine-tuning options.

Abstract: We introduce a high-throughput neural network accelerator that embeds most network layers directly in hardware, minimizing data transfer and memory usage while preserving a degree of flexibility via a small neural processing unit for the final classification layer. By leveraging power-of-two (Po2) quantization for weights, we replace multiplications with simple rewiring, effectively reducing each convolution to a series of additions. This streamlined approach offers high-throughput, energy-efficient processing, making it highly suitable for applications where model parameters remain stable, such as continuous sensing tasks at the edge or large-scale data center deployments. Furthermore, by including a strategically chosen reprogrammable final layer, our design achieves high throughput without sacrificing fine-tuning capabilities. We implement this accelerator in a 7nm ASIC flow using MobileNetV2 as a baseline and report throughput, area, accuracy, and sensitivity to quantization and pruning - demonstrating both the advantages and potential trade-offs of the proposed architecture. We find that for MobileNetV2, we can improve inference throughput by 20x over fully programmable GPUs, processing 1.21 million images per second through a full forward pass while retaining fine-tuning flexibility. If absolutely no post-deployment fine tuning is required, this advantage increases to 67x at 4 million images per second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of achieving low-latency and resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs, crucial for real-time and low-power applications.

Method: It proposes exploiting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with learnable one-dimensional splines as edge activations, optimizing them with quantization and pruning for compact LUT-based FPGA implementations.

Result: KANELÉ delivers up to 2700x speed improvement and significant resource savings compared to prior approaches while matching or outperforming other architectures on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework is resource-efficient, versatile, and suitable for various applications like symbolic/physical tasks and power-efficient, real-time control systems.

Abstract: Low-latency, resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs is essential for applications demanding real-time capability and low power. Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANELÉ, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures. Our results demonstrate up to a 2700x speedup and orders of magnitude resource savings compared to prior KAN-on-FPGA approaches. Moreover, KANELÉ matches or surpasses other LUT-based architectures on widely used benchmarks, particularly for tasks involving symbolic or physical formulas, while balancing resource usage across FPGA hardware. Finally, we showcase the versatility of the framework by extending it to real-time, power-efficient control systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face challenges in on-device deployment due to their large parameter size and inefficient resource usage by expert offloading.

Method: SliceMoE comprises Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC) for precise caching, Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT) for mixed-precision handling, and Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to optimize early decoding.

Result: SliceMoE achieves up to 2.37x and 2.85x energy reduction and up to 1.81x and 1.64x latency improvement while maintaining accuracy in evaluations on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B models.

Conclusion: Slice-level caching enables efficient energy and latency improvements for on-device MoE deployment without compromising the accuracy of high-bit models.

Abstract: MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.

### [61] [An Optimal Alignment-Driven Iterative Closed-Loop Convergence Framework for High-Performance Ultra-Large Scale Layout Pattern Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13133)
*Shuo Liu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for clustering VLSI technology layout patterns to optimize Design for Manufacturability (DFM) applications, achieving significant speedup and data compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and volume of layout patterns in VLSI technology due to aggressive scaling create a computational bottleneck for clustering, which is critical for DFM applications like Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). Existing methods face challenges in computational efficiency and quality trade-offs.

Method: The paper introduces an Optimal Alignment-Driven Iterative Framework. It resolves alignment ambiguity using two algorithms: an FFT-based Phase Correlation method and a Robust Geometric Min-Max strategy. Clustering is treated as a Set Cover Problem (SCP), with a Surprisal-Based Lazy Greedy heuristic and an iterative refinement loop for convergence. Redundant computations are reduced with a multi-stage pruning mechanism.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 93.4% compression ratio and over 100x speedup compared to the baseline, effectively clustering tens of thousands of patterns in seconds. It secured First Place in a prominent EDA competition.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes traditional challenges in layout pattern clustering, delivering a scalable and precise solution for VLSI DFM applications. Its demonstrated performance in a competitive setting affirms its practical impact.

Abstract: With the aggressive scaling of VLSI technology, the explosion of layout patterns creates a critical bottleneck for DFM applications like OPC. Pattern clustering is essential to reduce data complexity, yet existing methods struggle with computational prohibitiveness ($O(N^2)$ comparisons), sub-optimal discrete sampling for center alignment, and difficult speed-quality trade-offs. To address these, we propose an Optimal Alignment-Driven Iterative Closed-Loop Convergence Framework. First, to resolve alignment ambiguity, we introduce a hybrid suite of high-performance algorithms: an FFT-based Phase Correlation method for cosine similarity constraints, and a Robust Geometric Min-Max strategy for edge displacement constraints that analytically solves for the global optimum. Second, we model clustering as a Set Cover Problem (SCP) using a Surprisal-Based Lazy Greedy heuristic within a coarse-to-fine iterative refinement loop to ensure convergence. Additionally, a multi-stage pruning mechanism filters over 99% of redundant computations. Experimental results on the 2025 China Postgraduate EDA Elite Challenge benchmark demonstrate a 93.4% compression ratio relative to raw inputs and an over 100x speedup compared to the official baseline, effectively handling tens of thousands of patterns in seconds. Securing First Place among 77 teams, this approach proves its superiority in solving the NP-Hard layout clustering problem with an optimal balance of scalability and precision.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: 6.76 TOPS (XDNA) and 38.05 TOPS (XDNA2) for int8 precision, and 3.14 TOPS (XDNA) and 14.71 TOPS (XDNA2) for bf16 precision.

Conclusion: The paper offers substantial improvements in GEMM performance for AMD's NPUs, providing valuable insights into optimizing AI hardware capabilities.

Abstract: The high computational and memory demands of modern deep learning (DL) workloads have led to the development of specialized hardware devices from cloud to edge, such as AMD's Ryzen AI XDNA NPUs. Optimizing general matrix multiplication (GEMM) algorithms for these architectures is critical for improving DL workload performance.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses reproducibility challenges in simulation-based computer architecture research by enhancing the gem5 simulator and gem5 Resources repository.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face inconsistency in workflows when using gem5 and gem5 Resources due to challenges such as complex disk-image creation, limited guest-host communication features, and the need for custom scripting for simulations.

Method: The authors introduce standardized disk-image creation using Packer, provide validated base images and new artifacts, refactor the exit event system for better guest-host communication, and implement Suites and MultiSim for parallel simulations.

Result: The enhancements include 12 new disk images, 6 new kernels, over 200 workloads, and tools for better simulation management, reducing complexity and improving reproducibility.

Conclusion: These improvements standardize and strengthen gem5 workflows, providing researchers with accessible, validated resources to enhance reproducibility in computer architecture research.

Abstract: Reproducibility in simulation-based computer architecture research requires coordinating artifacts like disk images, kernels, and benchmarks, but existing workflows are inconsistent. We improve gem5, an open-source simulator with over 1600 forks, and gem5 Resources, a centralized repository of over 2000 pre-packaged artifacts, to address these issues. While gem5 Resources enables artifact sharing, researchers still face challenges. Creating custom disk images is complex and time-consuming, with no standardized process across ISAs, making it difficult to extend and share images. gem5 provides limited guest-host communication features through a set of predefined exit events that restrict researchers' ability to dynamically control and monitor simulations. Lastly, running simulations with multiple workloads requires researchers to write custom external scripts to coordinate multiple gem5 simulations which creates error-prone and hard-to-reproduce workflows. To overcome this, we introduce several features in gem5 and gem5 Resources. We standardize disk-image creation across x86, ARM, and RISC-V using Packer, and provide validated base images with pre-annotated benchmark suites (NPB, GAPBS). We provide 12 new disk images, 6 new kernels, and over 200 workloads across three ISAs. We refactor the exit event system to a class-based model and introduce hypercalls for enhanced guest-host communication that allows researchers to define custom behavior for their exit events. We also provide a utility to remotely monitor simulations and the gem5-bridge driver for user-space m5 operations. Additionally, we implemented Suites and MultiSim to enable parallel full-system simulations from gem5 configuration scripts, eliminating the need for external scripting. These features reduce setup complexity and provide extensible, validated resources that improve reproducibility and standardization.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Lyra, a RISC-V verification framework that combines hardware acceleration with a semantic-aware generative model to significantly enhance hardware verification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow convergence of verification coverage and high costs caused by low-quality, semantically blind random test stimuli in hardware verification processes.

Method: Lyra pairs hardware-accelerated verification using FPGA SoC with an ISA-aware generative model called LyraGen to generate high-quality, instruction sequences for better verification coverage.

Result: Lyra achieves significant improvements, with up to 1.27x higher coverage and up to 3343x faster verification compared to state-of-the-art software fuzzers.

Conclusion: Lyra demonstrates effective acceleration and quality in hardware verification, showcasing potential advancements for complex processor designs.

Abstract: As processor designs grow more complex, verification remains bottlenecked by slow software simulation and low-quality random test stimuli. Recent research has applied software fuzzers to hardware verification, but these rely on semantically blind random mutations that may generate shallow, low-quality stimuli unable to explore complex behaviors. These limitations result in slow coverage convergence and prohibitively high verification costs. In this paper, we present Lyra, a heterogeneous RISC-V verification framework that addresses both challenges by pairing hardware-accelerated verification with an ISA-aware generative model. Lyra executes the DUT and reference model concurrently on an FPGA SoC, enabling high-throughput differential checking and hardware-level coverage collection. Instead of creating verification stimuli randomly or through simple mutations, we train a domain-specialized generative model, LyraGen, with inherent semantic awareness to generate high-quality, semantically rich instruction sequences. Empirical results show Lyra achieves up to $1.27\times$ higher coverage and accelerates end-to-end verification by up to $107\times$ to $3343\times$ compared to state-of-the-art software fuzzers, while consistently demonstrating lower convergence difficulty.

### [65] [Enhancing Urban Visual Place Recognition for Crowdsourced Flood Imagery via LLM-Guided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11811)
*Fengyi Xu,Jun Ma,Waishan Qiu,Cui Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VPR-AttLLM, a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance Visual Place Recognition (VPR) performance, particularly in crowdsourced urban flooding imagery, with 1-8% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the lack of reliable geolocation metadata in crowdsourced crisis imagery and resolve performance degradation observed in existing VPR models when dealing with distorted and domain-shifted visuals.

Method: VPR-AttLLM integrates LLM's semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge into VPR pipelines to selectively enhance spatially-informative features while minimizing visual noise, without model retraining or added data.

Result: The method improves retrieval recall performance by 1-8% across benchmarks including new datasets with synthetic, real flood, and urban imagery, demonstrating robust geolocation performance.

Conclusion: VPR-AttLLM offers a scalable, interpretable, and plug-and-play enhancement for VPR architectures that bridges human spatial reasoning with machine learning for urban monitoring and crisis imagery geolocation.

Abstract: Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides valuable real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.

*Minghui Liu,Aadi Palnitkar,Tahseen Rabbani,Hyunwoo Jae,Kyle Rui Sang,Dixi Yao,Shayan Shabihi,Fuheng Zhao,Tian Li,Ce Zhang,Furong Huang,Kunpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines KV cache compression strategies for large language models (LLMs) in long-context reasoning tasks, highlighting the importance of careful strategy selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face memory constraints due to the linear growth of the KV cache, making it necessary to explore compression strategies for efficient reasoning tasks and long-context handling.

Method: The authors benchmarked various compression algorithms, such as H2O and SnapKV, focusing on both reasoning and non-reasoning tasks to evaluate their efficacy in managing cache and inference tradeoffs.

Result: H2O and SnapKV prove to be effective for reasoning tasks, as they leverage heavy-hitter tracking. The eviction strategies employed also enabled extended reasoning within constrained cache budgets.

Conclusion: No single compression strategy fits all scenarios, and cache management influences inference cost and reasoning capabilities. Tailored strategies are essential based on dataset type and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on long-context tasks, but are often bottlenecked by memory constraints. Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in discrete language space reasoning by enabling models to think in continuous embedding spaces for tasks like mathematical reasoning.

Method: The authors explore reinforcement learning (including GRPO and a new Latent RL method) to optimize latent-space thinking steps for complex reasoning tasks.

Result: Experimental results show that RL-trained latent models underperform compared to traditional CoT models in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, is insufficient for enabling latent-space thinking to surpass discrete language reasoning in mathematical tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning typically utilizes the discrete language space for thinking, which is inherently inefficient, as many generated tokens only enforce linguistic rules that are not required for reasoning. To bypass this, latent-space thinking allows models to think using the continuous embedding space. While existing methods for training those models show domain-specific gains, they fail to maintain performance in complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps. Our experimental results reveal that these RL-trained models still lag behind traditional language-space CoT models in the mathematical reasoning domain. We make our codebase publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KH-FUNSD, the first comprehensive dataset designed for Khmer form document understanding, addressing challenges in automated layout analysis of low-resource non-Latin scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Khmer, spoken by over 17 million, lacks resources for document AI tools, particularly for critical business documents such as invoices and receipts.

Method: KH-FUNSD features a multi-level annotation framework: region detection, FUNSD-style question-answer headers' relationships, and fine-grained classification for semantic roles.

Result: Benchmarking on leading models provides baseline results for Khmer business document analysis, showcasing challenges and opportunities in non-Latin, low-resource scripts.

Conclusion: KH-FUNSD supports advanced layout analysis and precise information extraction, filling a critical gap in Khmer document AI resources.

Abstract: Automated document layout analysis remains a major challenge for low-resource, non-Latin scripts. Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools. The lack of dedicated resources is particularly acute for business documents, which are critical for both public administration and private enterprise. To address this gap, we present \textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols. This multi-level approach supports both comprehensive layout analysis and precise information extraction. We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts. The KH-FUNSD dataset and documentation will be available at URL.

*Glenn Zhang,Treasure Mayowa,Jason Fan,Yicheng Fu,Aaron Sandoval,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Direct Confidence Alignment' (DCA) to align verbalized confidence with internal confidence in Large Language Models, improving transparency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address discrepancies between a model's verbalized confidence and its internal token-based confidence, aiming to make LLMs more trustworthy and reliable.

Method: The proposed method, DCA, uses Direct Preference Optimization to align verbalized confidence with internal confidence instead of ground-truth accuracy. It also introduces new calibration metrics for evaluation.

Result: DCA improves alignment metrics for certain LLM architectures but shows ineffectiveness for others, underlining the need for more adaptable approaches.

Conclusion: DCA enhances transparency and reliability for some LLMs, but further model-sensitive strategies are required for broader applicability.

Abstract: Producing trustworthy and reliable Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important as their usage becomes more widespread. Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance and assess the accuracy and reliability of in-car conversational systems, which offer seamless and engaging user interactions but face challenges in their evaluation.

Method: The authors employ synthetic data generation, advanced prompting techniques (e.g., input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and multi-agent), and 13 diverse LLMs to evaluate system response coherence in a restaurant recommendation case.

Result: Reasoning models outperform non-reasoning ones, with improvements shown using advanced prompting techniques. The DeepSeek-R1 model achieved an F1-score of 0.99 with low cost, and DeepSeek-V3 was observed to have the best cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation provides an effective, scalable alternative to human benchmarks for understanding in-car conversational systems, particularly highlighting the balance between effectiveness and cost/time efficiency.

Abstract: In-Car Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) systems significantly enhance user experience by enabling seamless voice interactions. However, assessing their accuracy and reliability remains a challenge. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3. Our findings show that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and accurate alternative to traditional human evaluation for benchmarking contextual understanding in ConvQA systems.

TL;DR: BLASST introduces a sparse attention mechanism to optimize long-context inference in LLMs, achieving significant computation speed-ups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for efficient long-context inference capabilities in LLMs requires solutions to address computational and memory bottlenecks of standard attention mechanisms.

Method: BLASST employs a dynamic sparse attention mechanism by pruning attention matrices using a fixed threshold. It integrates seamlessly into FlashAttention kernels and applies to various attention variants, with minimal latency overhead.

Result: BLASST accelerates inference achieving 1.62x speedup in prefill and 1.48x speedup in decode stages, maintaining high accuracy with sparsity rates of 74.7% and 73.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: BLASST provides an effective, unified solution for optimizing long-context inference in LLMs and introduces sparsity-aware training for enhanced model robustness to sparse attention patterns.

Abstract: The growing demand for long-context inference capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the computational and memory bottlenecks inherent to the standard attention mechanism. To address this challenge, we introduce BLASST, a drop-in sparse attention method that dynamically prunes the attention matrix without any pre-computation or proxy scores. Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs. Furthermore, we explore sparsity-aware training as a natural extension, showing that models can be trained to be inherently more robust to sparse attention patterns, pushing the accuracy-sparsity frontier even further.

### [73] [Extending the Context of Pretrained LLMs by Dropping Their Positional Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12167)
*Yoav Gelberg,Koshi Eguchi,Takuya Akiba,Edoardo Cetin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called DroPE, allowing language models to extend context length without expensive finetuning by dropping positional embeddings after training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation where language models cannot efficiently generalize to unseen sequence lengths without additional finetuning due to over-dependence on positional embeddings.

Method: The method, DroPE, removes positional embeddings after training, following a short recalibration phase, enabling seamless zero-shot adaptation for language models.

Result: DroPE allows language models to extend their context length without additional finetuning while maintaining performance, outperforming existing methods and architectures.

Conclusion: Positional embeddings are useful for pretraining but can be safely removed afterward, enabling more efficient and flexible use of language models for longer contexts.

Abstract: So far, expensive finetuning beyond the pretraining sequence length has been a requirement for effectively extending the context of language models (LM). In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEDAL, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into Diffusion Language Model (DLM) inference, achieving significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current inference methods for Diffusion Language Models, which rely on suboptimal heuristics or require additional training for better token selection.

Method: MEDAL employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to initialize unmasking trajectories during inference, focusing on high-confidence actions to optimize DLM's generation process.

Result: MEDAL shows up to 22% improvement in performance across multiple benchmarks compared to existing inference strategies.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a new search-based inference paradigm for Diffusion Language Models, enhancing efficiency and global coherence in text generation.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive generation, offering parallel generation and improved global coherence. During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models.

*Yinzhu Cheng,Haihua Xie,Yaqing Wang,Miao He,Mingming Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic distance measurement method using multi-kernel Gaussian processes, evaluated in sentiment classification tasks using in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying semantic distance for tasks like text retrieval and classification requires adaptable methods that consider specific data distributions and tasks.

Method: The authors propose modeling semantic distance as a multi-kernel Gaussian process (MK-GP) combining Matérn and polynomial kernels. Parameters are learned from data under supervision.

Result: The MK-GP approach was tested in fine-grained sentiment classification using large language models and showed effective performance.

Conclusion: The proposed MK-GP semantic distance measure is adaptable, data-driven, and effective for sentiment classification with language models leveraging in-context learning.

Abstract: Semantic distance measurement is a fundamental problem in computational linguistics, providing a quantitative characterization of similarity or relatedness between text segments, and underpinning tasks such as text retrieval and text classification. From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed measure.

*Johan J. Bolhuis,Andrea Moro,Stephen Crain,Sandiway Fong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that large language models (LLMs) are ineffective for linguistic analysis due to their reliance on data-driven probabilistic modeling, contrasting human language ability based on internal computational systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used for language tasks, but the study aims to highlight their inadequacy for understanding linguistic phenomena compared to the inherent computational mechanisms of human language.

Method: The paper compares data-driven probabilistic approaches of LLMs with the mind-internal computational system underlying human language acquisition and processing.

Result: LLMs fail to replicate the minimal-input growth and discrimination capabilities of human language systems, emphasizing their limitations in linguistic comprehension.

Conclusion: Large language models' data-driven approach is fundamentally distinct from and inferior to the human mind's computational language system, making them unsuitable for deep linguistic study.

Abstract: Large Language Models are useless for linguistics, as they are probabilistic models that require a vast amount of data to analyse externalized strings of words. In contrast, human language is underpinned by a mind-internal computational system that recursively generates hierarchical thought structures. The language system grows with minimal external input and can readily distinguish between real language and impossible languages.

*Anika Sharma,Tianyi Niu,Emma Wrenn,Shashank Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates sound symbolism in size semantics across 27 languages, revealing non-arbitrary phonological patterns that transcend language families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the phenomenon of sound symbolism, specifically in the semantic domain of size, and to test its universality across languages at a large scale.

Method: The authors built a dataset of 810 adjectives from 27 languages, performed phonemic analysis, and used interpretable machine learning classifiers along with adversarial scrubbers to isolate linguistically universal patterns.

Result: Phonological features, such as vowels and consonants, were found to predict size semantics above chance levels, even across unrelated languages and families, showing cross-family sound-symbolic biases.

Conclusion: This paper provides computational evidence of sound-symbolic patterns in size semantics across languages, suggesting universality and sharing tools for future studies on iconicity.

Abstract: The phenomenon of sound symbolism, the non-arbitrary mapping between word sounds and meanings, has long been demonstrated through anecdotal experiments like Bouba Kiki, but rarely tested at scale. We present the first computational cross-linguistic analysis of sound symbolism in the semantic domain of size. We compile a typologically broad dataset of 810 adjectives (27 languages, 30 words each), each phonemically transcribed and validated with native-speaker audio. Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing. To probe universality beyond genealogy, we train an adversarial scrubber that suppresses language identity while preserving size signal (also at family granularity). Language prediction averaged across languages and settings falls below chance while size prediction remains significantly above chance, indicating cross-family sound-symbolic bias. We release data, code, and diagnostic tools for future large-scale studies of iconicity.

*Abhay Srivastava,Sam Jung,Spencer Mateega*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARKET-BENCH is a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in executing introductory quantitative trading tasks by requesting them to code backtesters that match verifiable implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seeks to evaluate and understand the capability of LLMs in handling quantitative trading strategy simulations, a use-case that requires both coding proficiency and financial reasoning.

Method: They introduce MARKET-BENCH to test LLMs on tasks like scheduled trading, pairs trading, and delta hedging, scoring models on reliability and numerical accuracy through backtest metrics.

Result: The assessment reveals variability in LLM performance; certain models excel in simpler tasks, while others show errors in price, inventory, and risk reasoning, even when producing runnable code.

Conclusion: Current LLMs can perform basic trading infrastructure tasks but struggle with robust financial reasoning, highlighting room for improvement. MARKET-BENCH and its leaderboard are made publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce MARKET-BENCH, a benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on introductory quantitative trading tasks by asking them to construct executable backtesters from natural-language strategy descriptions and market assumptions. Each instance specifies one of three canonical strategies -- scheduled trading on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), pairs trading on Coca-Cola (NASDAQ: KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ: PEP), or delta hedging on MSFT -- and models must produce code whose P\&L, drawdown, and position paths match a verifiable reference implementation. We assess twelve state-of-the-art models using a multi-round pass@k metric that separates structural reliability (whether the backtest runs) from numerical accuracy (mean absolute error of the backtest metrics). While most models reliably execute the simplest strategy (average pass@3 of 0.80), errors vary by orders of magnitude across models and tasks: Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet combine strong reliability with low error on simpler strategies, GPT-5.1 Codex-Max achieves perfect pass@1 on the first two strategies and the lowest best-run error on the easiest task, and Qwen3 Max attains perfect pass@3 yet sometimes produces inaccurate P\&L paths. These results show that current LLMs can scaffold basic trading infrastructure but still struggle to reason robustly about prices, inventory, and risk; we release MARKET-BENCH and a public leaderboard at https://marketbench.ai.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight Romanian language adapter for the F5-TTS model, retaining original voice cloning and multilingual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enrich the F5-TTS model with Romanian language support without compromising its existing features like voice cloning and English/Chinese support.

Method: A sub-network extension is appended to the model with ConvNeXt integration to process Romanian text and maintain frozen original weights.

Result: Evaluation involving 20 human listeners shows effective Romanian natural-sounding speech generation, voice cloning maintained, partial code-switching ability, but residual English accent remains.

Conclusion: The adapted model succeeds in producing Romanian utterances while keeping other language capabilities intact with some limitations in accent neutrality for code-switching scenarios.

Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight input-level adapter for the F5-TTS model that enables Romanian Language support. To preserve the existing capabilities of the model (voice cloning, English and Chinese support), we keep the original weights frozen, append a sub-network to the model and train it as an extension for the textual embedding matrix of the text encoder. For simplicity, we rely on ConvNeXt module implemented in F5-TTS to also model the co-dependencies between the new character-level embeddings. The module serves as a ``soft`` letter-to-sound layer, converting Romanian text into a continuous representation that the F5-TTS model uses to produce naturally sounding Romanian utterances. We evaluate the model with a pool of 20 human listeners across three tasks: (a) audio similarity between reference and generated speech, (b) pronunciation and naturalness and (c) Romanian-English code-switching. The results indicate that our approach maintains voice cloning capabilities and enables, to a certain extent, code-switching within the same utterance; however, residual English accent characteristics remain. We open-source our code and provide example audio samples at https://github.com/racai-ro/Ro-F5TTS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework for information extraction, coupled with a Multi-task Bilingual Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset, which reduces training costs and improves alignment with large language model (LLM) preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning paradigms for LLM-powered information extraction systems are costly and struggle to align well with LLM preferences.

Method: The SCIR framework integrates a Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, while the MBSC dataset distills GPT-4 capabilities for multilingual IE.

Result: SCIR improves performance across named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction tasks, achieving a 5.27% average increase in span-based Micro-F1 scores and an 87% reduction in training costs compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed SCIR framework and MBSC dataset address major limitations in current IE systems, enhancing both flexibility and efficiency for future lightweight paradigms.

Abstract: Although Large language Model (LLM)-powered information extraction (IE) systems have shown impressive capabilities, current fine-tuning paradigms face two major limitations: high training costs and difficulties in aligning with LLM preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel universal IE paradigm, the Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework, along with a Multi-task Bilingual (Chinese-English) Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset containing over 100,000 entries. The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches. These advancements not only enhance the flexibility and accuracy of IE systems but also pave the way for lightweight and efficient IE paradigms.

### [81] [Can GPT replace human raters? Validity and reliability of machine-generated norms for metaphors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12444)
*Veronica Mangiaterra,Hamad Al-Azary,Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro,Paolo Canal,Valentina Bambini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the trustworthiness and reliability of GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ratings for metaphor properties, showing promising but variable alignment with human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are increasingly used in scientific research, including psycholinguistics, for automating tasks like human-rated dataset augmentation. Assessing their trustworthiness in handling complex items like metaphors is crucial.

Method: Three GPT models were used to generate ratings on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability for 687 metaphorical items in two languages (English and Italian). Their outputs were validated against human ratings and tested for ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses.

Result: GPT models generated ratings positively correlated with human ratings, achieving moderate-to-strong correlations across different languages and properties. Larger models performed better, and ratings predicted behavioral and EEG outcomes as reliably as human ratings, though some misalignment persisted for conventionality and multimodal meaning aspects.

Conclusion: GPT models, especially larger ones, can reliably augment or replace human ratings for metaphor properties but require careful consideration of metaphor complexity (e.g., sensorimotor features).

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in scientific research, the issue of their trustworthiness becomes crucial. In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how popular LLMs align culturally by using Hofstede's dimensions and testing cultural prompts for adaptability to six countries' cultural contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cultural biases of LLMs and assess their adaptability to align with diverse cultural norms.

Method: The authors used Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and the VSM13 International Survey to evaluate LLMs' cultural alignments and employed cultural prompts to test shifts in their adaptations towards six target countries.

Result: Most LLMs displayed a U.S.-centric bias when culture was unspecified. Cultural prompting helped shift seven out of eight models closer to the target culture, though models struggled to align with Japanese and Chinese cultures.

Conclusion: LLMs show adaptability toward cultural alignment when prompted, but aligning with non-Western cultures, specifically Japan and China, remains a challenge, signaling the need for better cultural sensitivity in model design.

Abstract: Culture is the bedrock of human interaction; it dictates how we perceive and respond to everyday interactions. As the field of human-computer interaction grows via the rise of generative Large Language Models (LLMs), the cultural alignment of these models become an important field of study. This work, using the VSM13 International Survey and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, identifies the cultural alignment of popular LLMs (DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4, Claude Opus 4, Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large). We then use cultural prompting, or using system prompts to shift the cultural alignment of a model to a desired country, to test the adaptability of these models to other cultures, namely China, France, India, Iran, Japan, and the United States. We find that the majority of the eight LLMs tested favor the United States when the culture is not specified, with varying results when prompted for other cultures. When using cultural prompting, seven of the eight models shifted closer to the expected culture. We find that models had trouble aligning with Japan and China, despite two of the models tested originating with the Chinese company DeepSeek.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant under-resourcing of languages like Nagamese in technology, thereby improving digital representation and accessibility for such languages.

Method: The authors developed a multi-stage pipeline using an expert-guided LLM to generate data, refined and annotated by native speakers. They trained models for foundational NLP tasks using these datasets.

Result: The authors achieved benchmark performances with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model and created NagaLLaMA, a high-performing conversational model, significantly improving over zero-shot and few-shot baselines.

Conclusion: NagaNLP sets a new standard for NLP tasks in Nagamese, releasing datasets, models, and code. It offers a reproducible framework for addressing data scarcity in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: The vast majority of the world's languages, particularly creoles like Nagamese, remain severely under-resourced in Natural Language Processing (NLP), creating a significant barrier to their representation in digital technology. This paper introduces NagaNLP, a comprehensive open-source toolkit for Nagamese, bootstrapped through a novel methodology that relies on LLM-driven but human-validated synthetic data generation. We detail a multi-stage pipeline where an expert-guided LLM (Gemini) generates a candidate corpus, which is then refined and annotated by native speakers. This synthetic-hybrid approach yielded a 10K pair conversational dataset and a high-quality annotated corpus for foundational tasks. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we trained both discriminative and generative models. Our fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base model establishes a new benchmark for Nagamese, achieving a 93.81\% accuracy (0.90 F1-Macro) on Part-of-Speech tagging and a 0.75 F1-Macro on Named Entity Recognition, massively outperforming strong zero-shot baselines. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a Llama-3.2-3B Instruct model, named NagaLLaMA, which demonstrates superior performance on conversational tasks, achieving a Perplexity of 3.85, an order of magnitude improvement over its few-shot counterpart (96.76). We release the NagaNLP toolkit, including all datasets, models, and code, providing a foundational resource for a previously underserved language and a reproducible framework for reducing data scarcity in other low-resource contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperEdit, a novel approach for instruction-based text editing that addresses key issues of aligning edits with user intent and preventing unwanted content changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve instruction-based text editing for real-world applications, where existing approaches fail to faithfully implement user instructions and often over-edit the unchanged content.

Method: HyperEdit incorporates two core methods: hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation for generating request-specific parameters, and difference-aware regularization to focus on modified spans while avoiding excessive edits.

Result: HyperEdit achieves a 9%–30% relative improvement in BLEU scores on modified regions compared to state-of-the-art methods, despite using only 3B parameters.

Conclusion: HyperEdit provides a more reliable and precise solution for instruction-based text editing, offering significant performance improvements with fewer model parameters.

Abstract: Instruction-based text editing is increasingly critical for real-world applications such as code editors (e.g., Cursor), but Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to struggle with this task. Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes. HyperEdit achieves a 9%--30% relative improvement in BLEU on modified regions over state-of-the-art baselines, despite utilizing only 3B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoVRL, a reinforcement learning method to improve coherence and exploration in language model reasoning, achieving enhanced performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for language models relies on verifiable rewards, limiting general reasoning capabilities. Alternative verifier-free approaches exist but suffer from inefficiencies due to decoupled sampling strategies.

Method: The paper proposes CoVRL, which integrates variational inference with reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions using a hybrid sampling strategy for efficient reasoning-trace exploration.

Result: CoVRL shows a 12.4% improvement over the base model and 2.3% over state-of-the-art verifier-free RL methods in general and mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoVRL provides a robust, principled framework to enhance reasoning effectiveness in language models by optimizing trace coherence and exploration.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning have achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, they are constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the intrinsic probabilities of LLMs generating reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \textit{\b{Co}upled \b{V}ariational \b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over strong state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.

*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-inspired learning approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle rare and unseen scenarios more effectively by using symbolic memory and an entropy-guided method discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with rare, low-resource, or unseen scenarios because these are sparsely available in training datasets. LLMs also mainly rely on implicit memory, which hinders their ability to explicitly acquire and refine generalizable methods.

Method: The proposed framework combines Obvious Record, a symbolic memory that stores cause-result relationships, and Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, which prioritizes capturing diverse underrepresented strategies based on semantic dissimilarity.

Result: The framework outperformed random baselines by achieving stronger coverage of unseen questions and greater internal diversity in a test of 60 semantically diverse question-solution pairs.

Conclusion: The entropy-guided method enhances LLMs' ability to discover better generalizable, human-inspired solutions, thus improving learning from infrequent or unique situations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at extracting common patterns from large-scale corpora, yet they struggle with rare, low-resource, or previously unseen scenarios-such as niche hardware deployment issues or irregular IoT device behaviors-because such cases are sparsely represented in training data. Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods.

Result: StruProKGR outperforms prior path-based methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, as demonstrated across five sparse KG reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed StruProKGR provides a more effective, efficient, and interpretable solution for reasoning on sparse knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Sparse Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are commonly encountered in real-world applications, where knowledge is often incomplete or limited. Sparse KG reasoning, the task of inferring missing knowledge over sparse KGs, is inherently challenging due to the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of capturing relational patterns in sparse scenarios. Among all sparse KG reasoning methods, path-based ones have attracted plenty of attention due to their interpretability. Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other. Extensive experiments on five sparse KG reasoning benchmarks reveal that StruProKGR surpasses existing path-based methods in both effectiveness and efficiency, providing an effective, efficient, and interpretable solution for sparse KG reasoning.

### [89] [Understanding Syllogistic Reasoning in LLMs from Formal and Natural Language Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12620)
*Aheli Poddar,Saptarshi Sahoo,Sujata Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how large language models (LLMs) perform syllogistic reasoning from both logical and natural language perspectives, involving 14 different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the fundamental reasoning abilities of LLMs and assess their progress in formal reasoning compared to human-like nuanced reasoning.

Method: The authors test 14 LLMs' syllogistic reasoning capabilities, analyzing both symbolic inferences and natural language understanding.

Result: Certain models exhibit perfect symbolic reasoning performances, though it is not consistently observed across all LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs may be evolving as formal reasoning mechanisms rather than adopting the nuanced reasoning abilities more aligned with human cognition.

Abstract: We study syllogistic reasoning in LLMs from the logical and natural language perspectives. In process, we explore fundamental reasoning capabilities of the LLMs and the direction this research is moving forward. To aid in our studies, we use 14 large language models and investigate their syllogistic reasoning capabilities in terms of symbolic inferences as well as natural language understanding. Even though this reasoning mechanism is not a uniform emergent property across LLMs, the perfect symbolic performances in certain models make us wonder whether LLMs are becoming more and more formal reasoning mechanisms, rather than making explicit the nuances of human reasoning.

### [90] [Which Pieces Does Unigram Tokenization Really Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12641)
*Sander Land,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the complexities of implementing Unigram tokenization and provides a practical guide for its execution, including a proposal for a simpler algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the practical adoption of the Unigram algorithm, which is theoretically sound but underutilized due to complex implementation.

Method: The authors offer clear guidelines for the implementation of Unigram tokenization and suggest an alternative algorithm that sacrifices some training accuracy for better compression.

Result: The study highlights a simpler alternative algorithm that strikes a balance between training loss and compression efficiency while making Unigram tokenization more accessible.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap between theoretical advantages and practical limitations of Unigram tokenization, promoting its broader utilization by simplifying its implementation and offering an alternative method.

Abstract: The Unigram tokenization algorithm offers a probabilistic alternative to the greedy heuristics of Byte-Pair Encoding. Despite its theoretical elegance, its implementation in practice is complex, limiting its adoption to the SentencePiece package and adapters thereof. We bridge this gap between theory and practice by providing a clear guide to implementation and parameter choices. We also identify a simpler algorithm that accepts slightly higher training loss in exchange for improved compression.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a schema for capturing legal relations in Chinese civil cases, formulates a legal relation extraction task, and presents LexRel for benchmarking. They evaluate LLMs, identifying limitations and showing performance gains in legal AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal relations are essential for civil law analyses and judicial practices, yet underexplored in Chinese civil cases within legal AI due to the lack of comprehensive schema.

Method: Developed and presented a comprehensive schema with taxonomy and definitions for legal relations, introduced LexRel benchmark annotated by experts, and evaluated LLMs for legal relation extraction.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show significant limitations in identifying legal relations. Improved performance observed when legal relations information is applied to downstream legal AI tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured legal relations into AI systems benefits understanding and performance in legal AI applications, revealing the need for advancements in LLMs for legal relation extraction.

Abstract: Legal relations form a highly consequential analytical framework of civil law system, serving as a crucial foundation for resolving disputes and realizing values of the rule of law in judicial practice. However, legal relations in Chinese civil cases remain underexplored in the field of legal artificial intelligence (legal AI), largely due to the absence of comprehensive schemas. In this work, we firstly introduce a comprehensive schema, which contains a hierarchical taxonomy and definitions of arguments, for AI systems to capture legal relations in Chinese civil cases. Based on this schema, we then formulate legal relation extraction task and present LexRel, an expert-annotated benchmark for legal relation extraction in Chinese civil law. We use LexRel to evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on legal relation extractions, showing that current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in accurately identifying civil legal relations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating legal relations information leads to consistent performance gains on other downstream legal AI tasks.

*Hassan Mujtaba,Hamza Naveed,Hanzlah Munir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores authorship analysis using graph-based modeling of narrative structures in Urdu novels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Authorship analysis has underexplored narrative structures, especially in low-resource languages like Urdu.

Method: Represents novels as character interaction networks and compares supervised and unsupervised graph-based approaches.

Result: Learned graph representations achieve up to 0.857 accuracy in distinguishing authors from a dataset of 52 Urdu novels.

Conclusion: Narrative structure in novels can reliably infer authorial style, leveraging graph representations effectively for authorship analysis.

Abstract: Authorship analysis has traditionally focused on lexical and stylistic cues within text, while higher-level narrative structure remains underexplored, particularly for low-resource languages such as Urdu. This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.

*Amirhossein Yousefiramandi,Ciaran Cooney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates strategies to fine-tune decoder-only LLMs for text classification with limited computational resources, using quantization and LoRA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop resource-efficient methods for fine-tuning large-scale LLMs for classification tasks without compromising model performance.

Method: Two fine-tuning approaches are explored: attaching a classification head to the LLM and fine-tuning its final token embedding representation, and instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt-response format. The paper uses model quantization and LoRA to enable fine-tuning on a single GPU.

Result: The embedding-based method outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score and surpasses domain-specific fine-tuned models like BERT, even in extremely resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Directly using internal LLM representations with efficient fine-tuning techniques offers strong performance in classification tasks. The paper also outlines practical recommendations for future optimizations in LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: We explore efficient strategies to fine-tune decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream text classification under resource constraints. Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks. These results demonstrate that directly leveraging the internal representations of causal LLMs, along with efficient fine-tuning techniques, yields impressive classification performance under limited computational resources. We discuss the advantages of each approach while outlining practical guidelines and future directions for optimizing LLM fine-tuning in classification scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Addressing context explosion in LLM tasks, CoDA employs a hierarchical design splitting planning and execution, leading to better performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issue of context explosion in LLMs during complex, multi-step tasks, which degrades performance in long-context scenarios.

Method: Introduced CoDA, a hierarchical agent using the PECO reinforcement learning framework. CoDA splits tasks into high-level planning and low-level execution roles, leveraging a shared LLM backbone with decoupled contexts.

Result: CoDA outperformed state-of-the-art baselines on multi-hop question-answering tasks and maintained performance stability in long-context scenarios where other methods failed.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design of CoDA effectively mitigates context overload, enabling better performance and robustness in solving complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL) show great promise for solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, their performance is often crippled by "Context Explosion", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the long-horizon software creation capabilities of coding agents, and finds that current models struggle to achieve high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks evaluating coding agents' abilities to work on long-horizon tasks, such as building complete software repositories from scratch.

Method: The benchmark involves agents designing and building a Python library from an empty workspace and a single natural language requirement, assessing their architecture design, dependency management, and cross-module logic implementation.

Result: Current coding agents perform poorly on NL2Repo Bench, with pass rates below 40% on average and frequent comprehensive failures in entire repository generation.

Conclusion: NL2Repo Bench provides a rigorous testbed showing the current limitations in long-horizon reasoning and execution by coding agents, emphasizing the need for improvements to meet real-world demands.

Abstract: Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents.

*Thales Sales Almeida,Rodrigo Nogueira,Hélio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a 7-billion-parameter model, Curió 7B, by continuing LLaMA-2's pretraining with 100 billion Portuguese tokens, and introduces another variant, Curió-Edu 7B, with better performance using only 10 billion high-quality educational and STEM data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of continued pretraining strategies for language models when adapted into underrepresented languages and verify the significance of data quantity versus quality.

Method: The paper performs continued pretraining of LLaMA-2 using a large Portuguese corpus (ClassiCC-PT). It compares two variants: a full-corpus model (Curió 7B) and a smaller, high-quality subset-trained model (Curió-Edu 7B).

Result: Curió-Edu 7B, despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computational resources, outperformed the full-corpus Curió 7B, underscoring the value of data quality in language model adaptation.

Conclusion: Targeted data selection is more critical than sheer data quantity when specializing general-purpose language models to new linguistic contexts, particularly for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context. This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings. In this work, we investigate this paradigm through Curió 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model derived from LLaMA-2 and trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus - the most extensive Portuguese-specific continued-pretraining effort above the three-billion-parameter scale to date. Beyond scale, we investigate whether quantity alone suffices or whether data quality plays a decisive role in linguistic adaptation. To this end, we introduce Curió-Edu 7B, a variant trained exclusively on the educational and STEM-filtered subset of the same corpus, totaling just 10 billion tokens. Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computation, Curió-Edu 7B surpasses the full-corpus model in our evaluations, demonstrating that data selection can be fundamental even when adapting models with limited prior exposure to the target language.

*Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo,Michael A. Hedderich,Ali Modarressi,Hinrich Schuetze,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a protocol to evaluate persona-assigned large language models (LLMs) in extended, multi-round real-world interactions, revealing their declining persona fidelity over long dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of persona-assigned LLMs insufficiently address their performance in extended dialogues, essential for applications in fields such as education, healthcare, and simulations.

Method: The authors developed an evaluation protocol combining long persona dialogues (over 100 rounds) with benchmark datasets to analyze persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety across seven state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: The study found a degradation of persona fidelity in extended conversations, particularly in goal-oriented dialogues. A trade-off between persona fidelity and instruction-following emerged, with models losing differentiation over time.

Conclusion: Persona fidelity in LLMs is fragile during extended interactions; the paper highlights these challenges and offers tools to systematically measure performance declines in long-context applications.

Abstract: Persona-assigned large language models (LLMs) are used in domains such as education, healthcare, and sociodemographic simulation. Yet, they are typically evaluated only in short, single-round settings that do not reflect real-world usage. We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long persona dialogues (over 100 rounds) and evaluation datasets to create dialogue-conditioned benchmarks that can robustly measure long-context effects. We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses. Our findings highlight the fragility of persona applications in extended interactions and our work provides a protocol to systematically measure such failures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the perception of reasoning tokens in LLMs as literal, human-like thought processes and redefines them as computational states for better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address misconceptions surrounding reasoning tokens in LLMs, as they're not faithful representations of the actual reasoning process, and to better understand their role.

Method: The introduction of the State over Tokens (SoT) framework, which reinterprets reasoning tokens as computational states rather than textual explanations.

Result: The SoT framework highlights the true function of reasoning tokens and surfaces new research questions about their role in LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: To properly understand LLMs' reasoning processes, research needs to move away from interpreting reasoning tokens as natural language and towards viewing them as stateful computational elements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state.

*Hanyu Cai,Binqi Shen,Lier Jin,Lan Hu,Xiaojing Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of linguistic tone in prompts on LLM performance across three models using the MMMLU benchmark, finding tone sensitivity varies by model, domain, and task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored influence of pragmatic elements like linguistic tone on LLM accuracy across different domains and model families.

Method: A systematic evaluation framework was applied, testing Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude tone prompts on three LLMs with statistical analysis of accuracy differences across STEM and Humanities tasks.

Result: Tone sensitivity is model-dependent and domain-specific, with Neutral/Friendly prompts generally performing better. Tone effects are significant in some Humanities tasks but diminish in aggregated domain performance.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs are largely robust to tonal variation in mixed-domain use, but tone impacts accuracy in specific interpretive tasks, providing insights for prompt engineering and real-world applications.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical factor influencing large language model (LLM) performance, yet the impact of pragmatic elements such as linguistic tone and politeness remains underexplored, particularly across different model families. In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.
  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments.

*Chris Latimer,Nicoló Boschi,Andrew Neeser,Chris Bartholomew,Gaurav Srivastava,Xuan Wang,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hindsight memory architecture significantly improves long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks by structuring memory into logical networks, bringing accuracy up to 91.4% on LongMemEval and surpassing existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current memory systems in handling context, inferring reasoning, and organizing information over long conversations, and enable agents to explain their reasoning with structured frameworks.

Method: Hindsight organizes memory into four logical networks (world facts, agent experiences, entity summaries, and evolving beliefs) and operates with retain, recall, and reflect actions. It builds a queryable memory bank and uses reflection for reasoning.

Result: Hindsight elevates accuracy from 39% to 83.6% using a 20B model and further scales to 91.4% with larger backbone models. It consistently exceeds prior architectures in multi-session and open-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hindsight introduces a structured memory framework that robustly enhances reasoning and long-term information organization, setting a new standard for agent memory systems.

Abstract: Agent memory has been touted as a dimension of growth for LLM-based applications, enabling agents that can accumulate experience, adapt across sessions, and move beyond single-shot question answering. The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark, LongStoryEval, for automatically evaluating lengthy books (>100K tokens). It explores key reader evaluation aspects and compares evaluation methods, proposing NovelCritique, a model that aligns better with human reviews than GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to tackle the challenge of automating the evaluation of long-form stories, understanding key evaluation aspects for readers, and identifying effective evaluation methods.

Method: Researchers created the LongStoryEval benchmark with 600 books, analyzing reader aspects to propose evaluation criteria. They experimented with aggregation, incremental, and summary-based evaluation techniques, leading to the development of the NovelCritique model.

Result: Aggregation-based evaluations excel in assessing details, while summary-based methods are more efficient. NovelCritique, the proposed model, outperformed GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations.

Conclusion: NovelCritique demonstrates efficiency and alignment with human evaluations, marking a step forward for automated assessments of long-form storytelling.

Abstract: In this work, we conduct systematic research in a challenging area: the automatic evaluation of book-length stories (>100K tokens). Our study focuses on two key questions: (1) understanding which evaluation aspects matter most to readers, and (2) exploring effective methods for evaluating lengthy stories. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, LongStoryEval, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an evaluation criteria structure and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform better, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency. Building on these insights, we further propose NovelCritique, an 8B model that leverages the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects. NovelCritique outperforms commercial models like GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations. Our datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/DingyiYang/LongStoryEval.

*Richard J. Young*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how safety alignment mechanisms in large language models affect legitimate research applications and evaluates tools for removing refusal behavior without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable legitimate research applications by removing refusal behavior in large language models without negatively impacting their core capabilities.

Method: Four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) were applied on 16 instruction-tuned models, with quantitative metrics used to measure tool compatibility and performance impact.

Result: Single-pass methods performed best in preserving capabilities, while Bayesian optimization showed variable impact. Mathematical reasoning was most sensitive to intervention, with large variations depending on the tool and model architecture.

Conclusion: Researchers can use the findings as evidence-based guidance for selecting abliteration tools for specific research applications, carefully considering the sensitivity of mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in large language models prevent responses to harmful queries through learned refusal behavior, yet these same mechanisms impede legitimate research applications including cognitive modeling, adversarial testing, and security analysis. While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.

*Furong Jia,Yuan Pu,Finn Guo,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on clinical diagnosis tasks using a newly introduced probabilistic method (FBPR), revealing complementary strengths between the new method and direct LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasoning capabilities behind LLMs' strong performance on clinical diagnosis benchmarks and to assess whether simple probabilistic methods could match or complement their results.

Method: The study introduces FBPR, a Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker, which scores diagnoses using Naive Bayes over co-occurrence statistics from large corpora. Comparisons are made between FBPR and LLM performance.

Result: FBPR achieves comparable results to LLMs when leveraging the same pretraining data. Moreover, FBPR and LLMs perform well on different sets of questions, indicating complementary advantages.

Conclusion: Explicit probabilistic baselines like FBPR remain valuable for benchmarking LLMs and may provide complementary strategies for hybrid systems. The performance of LLMs likely stems from more complex mechanisms rather than simple frequency-based aggregation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on multiple-choice clinical diagnosis benchmarks, yet it is unclear how much of this performance reflects underlying probabilistic reasoning. We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization. While the performance of LLMs seems to be driven by a mechanism other than simple frequency aggregation, we show that an approach similar to the historically grounded, low-complexity expert systems still accounts for a substantial portion of benchmark performance.

### [104] [Building from Scratch: A Multi-Agent Framework with Human-in-the-Loop for Multilingual Legal Terminology Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12950)
*Lingyi Meng,Maolin Liu,Hao Wang,Yilan Cheng,Qi Yang,Idlkaid Mohanmmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a human-AI collaborative framework for multilingual legal terminology mapping, prioritizing precision and scalability, especially for challenging languages like Chinese and Japanese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of accurately mapping legal terminology among languages like Chinese and Japanese, which contain many homographs with distinct meanings.

Method: A multi-agent framework is proposed involving AI agents performing automated tasks and human experts supervising, reviewing, and ensuring accuracy throughout the process.

Result: The framework, tested on a trilingual parallel corpus, improved the precision and consistency of legal terminology mapping, while also ensuring scalability.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop system successfully addresses the challenges of multilingual legal terminology mapping, outperforming traditional manual approaches in both precision and scalability.

Abstract: Accurately mapping legal terminology across languages remains a significant challenge, especially for language pairs like Chinese and Japanese, which share a large number of homographs with different meanings. Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods.

TL;DR: QwenLong-L1.5 enhances long-context reasoning with novel post-training methodologies including data synthesis, stabilized reinforcement learning, and memory-augmented architecture, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of long-context reasoning in AI models by developing systematic approaches to enhance reasoning tasks involving large-scale and complex information beyond retrieval abilities.

Method: The model combines innovations such as a long-context data synthesis pipeline, stabilized RL using adaptive exploration-exploitation optimization, and memory-augmented architectures tailored for ultra-long tasks.

Result: QwenLong-L1.5 delivers impressive performance, equating GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on benchmarks, improving baseline scores by ~9.90 points, and excelling in tasks with 1M~4M tokens.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates its ability in long-context reasoning and provides transferable improvements in domains like scientific inquiries and extended multi-turn dialogues.

Abstract: We introduce QwenLong-L1.5, a model that achieves superior long-context reasoning capabilities through systematic post-training innovations. The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline. Additionally, the acquired long-context reasoning ability translates to enhanced performance in general domains like scientific reasoning, memory tool using, and extended dialogue.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an author labeling technique wherein document authors annotate text during creation to enhance subjective feature labeling, achieving significant improvements in product recommendation algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of third-party text annotation, especially for egocentric features such as sentiment and belief, by sourcing labels directly from document authors.

Method: Using a commercial chatbot, the paper deploys a system that identifies queries, generates labeling questions dynamically, and collects annotations from authors in real-time while implementing an online-learning model for product recommendations.

Result: The author labeling system achieved a 534% improvement in click-through rate for product recommendations over the industry advertising baseline and was found to be higher quality, quicker, and more cost-effective compared to traditional annotation approaches.

Conclusion: Author labeling improves annotation quality for subjective features compared to third-party annotation, reinforcing previous findings and offering broader scientific adoption through a released service.

Abstract: The status quo for labeling text is third-party annotation, but there are many cases where information directly from the document's source would be preferable over a third-person proxy, especially for egocentric features like sentiment and belief. We introduce author labeling, an annotation technique where the writer of the document itself annotates the data at the moment of creation. We collaborate with a commercial chatbot with over 10,000 users to deploy an author labeling annotation system for subjective features related to product recommendation. This system identifies task-relevant queries, generates on-the-fly labeling questions, and records authors' answers in real time. We train and deploy an online-learning model architecture for product recommendation that continuously improves from author labeling and find it achieved a 534% increase in click-through rate compared to an industry advertising baseline running concurrently. We then compare the quality and practicality of author labeling to three traditional annotation approaches for sentiment analysis and find author labeling to be higher quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper. These findings reinforce existing literature that annotations, especially for egocentric and subjective beliefs, are significantly higher quality when labeled by the author rather than a third party. To facilitate broader scientific adoption, we release an author labeling service for the research community at academic.echollm.io.

*Cheril Shah,Akshit Agarwal,Kanak Garg,Mourad Heddaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares human and large language model (LLM) performance in bilateral negotiations, revealing how LLMs fail to adapt contextually compared to humans and struggle with dynamic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how human negotiation strategies differ from LLM strategies and to pinpoint limitations in current LLMs that prevent them from modeling human-like negotiation behaviors.

Method: The authors propose a mathematical framework for concession dynamics using hyperbolic tangent curves and introduce the metrics burstiness tau and CRI. They then conduct an empirical comparison of humans and four state-of-the-art LLMs in various negotiation scenarios.

Result: The study finds that humans adapt and infer strategies contextually during negotiations, while LLMs anchor at extreme points, lack strategy diversity, and occasionally display deceptive tactics. LLM capabilities remain stagnant even with better models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLMs have significant limitations in understanding opponent reasoning and context-sensitive strategy, stressing the need for improved models in negotiation tasks.

Abstract: Bilateral negotiation is a complex, context-sensitive task in which human negotiators dynamically adjust anchors, pacing, and flexibility to exploit power asymmetries and informal cues. We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy.

### [109] [Uncovering the Role of Initial Saliency in U-Shaped Attention Bias: Scaling Initial Token Weight for Enhanced Long-Text Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13109)
*Zewen Qiang,Sendong Zhao,Haochun Wang,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models struggle with long-text sequences due to an attention bias, favoring text beginnings and ends. This study identifies initial saliency as a key factor and proposes scaling attention weights to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in handling long-text sequences caused by attention biases.

Method: Scaling attention weights between the initial token and others, and combining this with techniques to reduce position encoding biases.

Result: Achieved up to 3.6% improvement in MDQA dataset and 3.4% improvement in KV-Retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Understanding initial saliency and adjusting attention mechanisms enhances long-context processing in LLMs, especially when combined with existing bias-reduction methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

### [110] [Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Accelerating Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13194)
*Chendong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in speculative decoding for language models using a new method, EARS, which adapts rejection thresholds to reduce random rejections and improve inference speed without model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency caused by fixed, context-independent rejection thresholds in speculative decoding, leading to plausible tokens being rejected in high-uncertainty contexts and undermining speed.

Method: The proposed Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS) dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by using a tolerance term based on the target model's uncertainty, optimizing the rejection sampling process.

Result: EARS demonstrated improved efficiency with up to an 18.12% throughput increase and a minimal 0.84% accuracy loss in experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks, specifically on the GSM8K benchmark.

Conclusion: EARS effectively optimizes speculative decoding by reducing random rejections with an adaptive approach, enhancing throughput while maintaining accuracy. It integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks without requiring model changes.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant "random rejection" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \(1 - \max(P_{\mathrm{target}})\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoTool introduces a framework for dynamic tool selection in large language models (LLMs), enhancing adaptability across diverse reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches restrict LLM agents to a fixed set of tools, limiting their adaptability to new and evolving toolsets.

Method: AutoTool combines a 200k dataset and a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) trajectory stabilization through supervised and RL training, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking for refined tool selection.

Result: AutoTool achieves notable improvements across benchmarks in math & science reasoning (+6.4%), search-based QA (+4.5%), code generation (+7.7%), and multimodal understanding (+6.9%) with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: AutoTool enhances LLM adaptability and generalization by dynamically incorporating unseen tools during inference while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning has advanced large language models (LLMs) to reason through long chain-of-thought trajectories while interleaving external tool use. Existing approaches assume a fixed inventory of tools, limiting LLM agents' adaptability to new or evolving toolsets. We present AutoTool, a framework that equips LLM agents with dynamic tool-selection capabilities throughout their reasoning trajectories. We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding. In addition, AutoTool exhibits stronger generalization by dynamically leveraging unseen tools from evolving toolsets during inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), to enhance distillation efficiency in large language models (LLMs) by accurately identifying and selecting reasoning-critical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently distilling multi-step reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs), which existing data selection methods fail to do effectively.

Method: The proposed method identifies reasoning-critical attention heads and quantifies an Attention Influence Score by disabling head influence to assess the importance of individual reasoning steps and samples. This enables both fine-grained tuning and effective data selection without supervision or additional training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistently improved reasoning accuracy on multiple benchmarks using AIR, outperforming traditional heuristic baselines.

Conclusion: AIR establishes a mechanism-driven and data-efficient approach for reasoning skill distillation, advancing the performance and efficiency of LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: LLMs achieve remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, yet effectively transferring these skills via post-training distillation remains challenging. Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples. Our work establishes a mechanism-driven, data-efficient approach for reasoning distillation in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve fact-checking by analyzing causal event relationships and enhancing explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fact-checking systems lack causal-based reasoning, which limits semantic explainability in detecting erroneous cause-effect relationships.

Method: The method combines event relation extraction, semantic similarity computation, and rule-based reasoning to identify inconsistencies in chains of events between claims and evidence.

Result: The method establishes a baseline for integrating causal event relationships into fact-checking, evaluated on two datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances explainability in fact-checking by addressing logical inconsistencies in causal event relationships.

Abstract: In fact-checking applications, a common reason to reject a claim is to detect the presence of erroneous cause-effect relationships between the events at play. However, current automated fact-checking methods lack dedicated causal-based reasoning, potentially missing a valuable opportunity for semantically rich explainability. To address this gap, we propose a methodology that combines event relation extraction, semantic similarity computation, and rule-based reasoning to detect logical inconsistencies between chains of events mentioned in a claim and in an evidence. Evaluated on two fact-checking datasets, this method establishes the first baseline for integrating fine-grained causal event relationships into fact-checking and enhance explainability of verdict prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in sentiment analysis, which overlooks changes in emotional dynamics within a text, especially in mental health contexts.

Method: The study uses pre-trained transformer models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa to detect sentence-level emotions and calculate emotion drift scores.

Result: The findings reveal insights into patterns of emotional escalation or relief in mental health messages.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the understanding of emotional dynamics and offers a method for analyzing mental health-related conversations effectively.

Abstract: This study investigates emotion drift: the change in emotional state across a single text, within mental health-related messages. While sentiment analysis typically classifies an entire message as positive, negative, or neutral, the nuanced shift of emotions over the course of a message is often overlooked. This study detects sentence-level emotions and measures emotion drift scores using pre-trained transformer models such as DistilBERT and RoBERTa. The results provide insights into patterns of emotional escalation or relief in mental health conversations. This methodology can be applied to better understand emotional dynamics in content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper conducts a detailed investigation into the scaling laws of multilingual code pre-training, revealing insights about how different programming languages influence performance improvements during model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for understanding the varying impacts of different programming languages on the performance of Code LLMs and the importance of considering the multilingual nature of software development for better scaling predictions.

Method: The study involves over 1000 experiments, covering various programming languages, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). It examines the effects of model scaling across languages and proposes a multilingual scaling law based on proportional token allocation.

Result: Interpreted languages like Python benefit more from increased data and model size compared to compiled languages like Rust. Multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, especially among syntactically similar languages. Parallel pairing enhances cross-lingual abilities.

Conclusion: The proposed proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law effectively optimizes token allocation to maximize performance across languages, considering varying language utilities and benefits of syntactic similarities.

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.

### [118] [Non-Resolution Reasoning: A Framework for Preserving Semantic Ambiguity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13478)
*Kei Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles the architectural limitation of language models where they prematurely commit to a single meaning, resulting in failures under ambiguous contexts. It proposes the Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) framework to preserve ambiguity and resolve meaning explicitly and only when required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often prematurely collapse semantic meaning, leading to brittle reasoning and context errors. The motivation is to overcome these limitations by preserving ambiguity until resolution is contextually appropriate.

Method: The NRR framework introduces three components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for maintaining ambiguity, Non-Collapsing Attention to avoid winner-take-all dynamics, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) to differentiate recurring entities based on context. An external Resolution Operator enables explicit control of semantic resolution.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of NRR, showing significant improvements in handling context and ambiguity over traditional transformer models, with CIT-enhanced models achieving 90.9% accuracy on identity-shift tasks compared to 9.1% for baselines.

Conclusion: NRR offers a principled approach to addressing semantic collapse by framing ambiguity as a representational state, enabling models to flexibly transition between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining.

Abstract: Premature semantic collapse -- the forced early commitment to a single meaning -- remains a core architectural limitation of current language models. Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing "Dr. Smith the cardiologist" from "Dr. Smith the researcher"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.

*Ayon Roy,Risat Rahaman,Sadat Shibly,Udoy Saha Joy,Abdulla Al Kafi,Farig Yousuf Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in Bangla-English machine translation, especially for informal Bangla, proposing dataset development from informal sources to improve Bangla translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources and advancements in open-source Bangla-English translation, particularly for informal language, ensuring better accessibility of online information to Bangla speakers.

Method: The authors propose developing a dataset utilizing informal sources such as social media and conversational texts, and studying current state-of-the-art models for Bangla machine translation.

Result: The research provides improved resources and methodologies for handling informal Bangla translation, making online resources more accessible to Bangla speakers.

Conclusion: Enhancing datasets and translation methods for informal Bangla can significantly benefit millions of native speakers by offering better access to essential digital information.

Abstract: Bangla is the sixth most widely spoken language globally, with approximately 234 million native speakers. However, progress in open-source Bangla machine translation remains limited. Most online resources are in English and often remain untranslated into Bangla, excluding millions from accessing essential information. Existing research in Bangla translation primarily focuses on formal language, neglecting the more commonly used informal language. This is largely due to the lack of pairwise Bangla-English data and advanced translation models. If datasets and models can be enhanced to better handle natural, informal Bangla, millions of people will benefit from improved online information access. In this research, we explore current state-of-the-art models and propose improvements to Bangla translation by developing a dataset from informal sources like social media and conversational texts. This work aims to advance Bangla machine translation by focusing on informal language translation and improving accessibility for Bangla speakers in the digital world.

TL;DR: SkipCat addresses issues of deploying large language models on resource-constrained devices by combining low-rank projection and block skipping techniques, achieving efficient compression without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of deploying large language models on edge devices, which have limited computational and memory resources, by improving the efficiency of low-rank compression methods.

Method: SkipCat introduces a low-rank compression framework combining (1) intra-layer shared low-rank projection, where multiple matrices with the same input use a shared projection to reduce redundancy, and (2) a block skipping technique that skips computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks in the decomposition.

Result: SkipCat achieves a 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks compared to previous low-rank compression methods under the same compression rates without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the SkipCat framework effectively enhances compression efficiency and model performance, making large language models more practical for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.

Motivation: Existing multilingual models like mBART50 overlook Khmer's specific linguistic challenges, necessitating the development of a specialized model for improved performance.

Method: The authors build PrahokBART from scratch using high-quality Khmer and English corpora, with linguistic enhancements such as word segmentation and normalization to address Khmer-specific linguistic issues.

Result: PrahokBART surpassed mBART50 in machine translation, text summarization, and headline generation, proving the importance of linguistic components and addressing space usage for natural Khmer text generation.

Conclusion: Specialized pre-training using well-curated corpora and linguistic modules can significantly enhance performance for underrepresented languages like Khmer, improving naturalness and accuracy in generative tasks.

Abstract: This work introduces {\it PrahokBART}, a compact pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model trained from scratch for Khmer using carefully curated Khmer and English corpora. We focus on improving the pre-training corpus quality and addressing the linguistic issues of Khmer, which are ignored in existing multilingual models, by incorporating linguistic components such as word segmentation and normalization. We evaluate PrahokBART on three generative tasks: machine translation, text summarization, and headline generation, where our results demonstrate that it outperforms mBART50, a strong multilingual pre-trained model. Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the impact of each linguistic module and evaluates how effectively our model handles space during text generation, which is crucial for the naturalness of texts in Khmer.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMNLP, a framework for evaluating psychological and ethical dimensions of LLMs in teacher roles, revealing strengths in abstract reasoning and vulnerabilities to harmful prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the lack of psychological and ethical evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) when simulating professional roles.

Method: EMNLP utilizes extended scales and teacher-specific moral dilemmas to assess personality, moral stages, and ethical risks. It employs soft prompt injection for evaluation and experiments on 14 LLMs.

Result: LLMs in teacher roles show idealized personalities and excel in abstract reasoning but struggle emotionally, with stronger models being more vulnerable to harmful prompts.

Conclusion: EMNLP highlights the paradox between capability and safety in LLMs as educational AI tools, establishing a benchmark for evaluating their ethical and alignment aspects.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 14 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors. This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at https://e-m-n-l-p.github.io/.

*Gibson Nkhata,Uttamasha Anjally Oyshi,Quan Mai,Susan Gauch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving the accuracy of rumor verification on social media by leveraging stance-aware structural modeling and addressing limitations in existing transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the spread of false information on social media by leveraging stance signals in conversation replies, which are crucial for determining the veracity of rumors.

Method: The paper introduces a stance-aware structural modeling approach that encodes stance signals for each post and aggregates reply embeddings by stance category. It also incorporates stance distribution and hierarchical depth to capture stance imbalance and reply depth influence.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in predicting the truthfulness of rumors, demonstrating improved performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively advances rumor verification capabilities, supports early rumor detection, and showcases generalizability across platforms, reinforcing its practical utility in combating misinformation.

Abstract: Verifying rumors on social media is critical for mitigating the spread of false information. The stances of conversation replies often provide important cues to determine a rumor's veracity. However, existing models struggle to jointly capture semantic content, stance information, and conversation strructure, especially under the sequence length constraints of transformer-based encoders. In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in the ability to predict truthfulness of a rumor. We also demonstrate that our model is versatile for early detection and cross-platfrom generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on agent memory systems, providing taxonomy, definitions, and prospects to unify and advance the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the fragmented and inconsistent understanding of memory in foundation model agents by providing clearer definitions, classifications, and perspectives for future exploration.

Method: The paper delineates agent memory from related concepts, uses a unified lens of forms (token-level, parametric, latent), functions (factual, experiential, and working memory), and dynamics (formation, evolution, retrieval). Additionally, it compiles benchmarks and identifies emerging research directions.

Result: A detailed taxonomy and conceptual understanding of agent memory is presented, alongside benchmarks and emerging frontiers such as multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and reinforcement learning integration.

Conclusion: This work enhances conceptual clarity, provides a practical foundation for implementation, and highlights potential research trajectories to establish memory as a core component in agent intelligence design.

Abstract: Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.

### [125] [ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13586)
*Jia-Nan Li,Jian Guan,Wei Wu,Chongxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFusion is a novel masked diffusion model that enhances inference efficiency and generation coherence by moving from token-level parallelism to slot-level decoding using a plan-and-infill approach. This results in significant performance gains and faster generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are slow due to sequential inference, and masked diffusion models face challenges like high computational overhead and incoherent generation. The goal is to create a better alternative for faster and coherent generation while addressing these issues.

Method: ReFusion uses a novel approach called slot-level parallel decoding. It employs a plan-and-infill process: a diffusion-based planning step identifies weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step decodes these slots in parallel. The slot-based strategy reduces complexity and allows full Key-Value cache reuse.

Result: ReFusion achieves 34% better performance and over 18x speedup compared to traditional masked diffusion models. It also narrows the efficiency gap with autoregressive models, offering a 2.33x average speedup.

Conclusion: ReFusion provides an effective and efficient alternative to overcome the shortcomings of masked diffusion and autoregressive models, making significant strides in speed and coherence without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Examining the effectiveness of textual gradient methods for prompt optimization in large language models and suggesting new insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of large language models without human involvement by improving prompt optimization techniques, focusing particularly on textual gradient methods.

Method: Conducting experiments and case studies to evaluate textual gradient methods and analyzing their behavior critically.

Result: Most textual gradient methods improve performance, but their widely accepted 'gradient analogy' explanation is not aligned with observed behavior.

Conclusion: Existing explanations of textual gradient methods are inadequate, and new strategies for prompt optimization should be developed based on these insights.

Abstract: A well-engineered prompt can increase the performance of large language models; automatic prompt optimization techniques aim to increase performance without requiring human effort to tune the prompts. One leading class of prompt optimization techniques introduces the analogy of textual gradients. We investigate the behavior of these textual gradient methods through a series of experiments and case studies. While such methods often result in a performance improvement, our experiments suggest that the gradient analogy does not accurately explain their behavior. Our insights may inform the selection of prompt optimization strategies, and development of new approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cascade RL, a new reinforcement learning method for general-purpose reasoning models, demonstrating superior performance and simplifying RL infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in building general-purpose reasoning models using RL, including cross-domain heterogeneity, training complexity, and hyperparameter selection.

Method: Cascade RL is used for sequential domain-wise reinforcement learning, complemented by RLHF for alignment to optimize reasoning and minimize degradation across domains.

Result: The 14B Nemotron-Cascade model outperformed its teacher model and achieved silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics.

Conclusion: Cascade RL simplifies RL infrastructure, delivers state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, and demonstrates its capability to optimize reasoning without significant trade-offs.

Abstract: Building general-purpose reasoning models with reinforcement learning (RL) entails substantial cross-domain heterogeneity, including large variation in inference-time response lengths and verification latency. Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We transparently share our training and data recipes.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how to tokenize continuous time in temporal event sequences for LLMs, comparing various encoding strategies. It finds no universally best method but highlights alignment between tokenization and data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring effective ways to represent continuous temporal data in LLMs, given challenges like diverse distributions in real-world event sequences.

Method: Empirical study comparing encoding strategies like numeric strings, byte-level representations, calendar tokens, uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization, assessed through fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets.

Result: No single encoding method performed best across all datasets; performance varied based on alignment between tokenization and the statistical distribution of the data.

Conclusion: Tokenization strategies should align closely with the statistical properties of datasets. Log-based approaches excel for skewed distributions while human-centric formats work well for mixed modalities.

Abstract: Representing continuous time is a critical and under-explored challenge in modeling temporal event sequences with large language models (LLMs). Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores large-language models' (LLMs) performance on U.S. Supreme Court decision classifications and shows that prompt-based models like DeepSeek outperform BERT-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs respond and memorize, especially their reliability and accuracy in handling complex domain-specific tasks.

Method: The researchers experimented with fine-tuning and retrieval-based approaches (e.g., parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling) for two classification tasks involving 15 and 279 labeled SCOTUS topics.

Result: Prompt-based models with memories (e.g., DeepSeek) achieved around 2-point higher performance compared to traditional BERT-based models on SCOTUS classification tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs with prompt-based mechanisms and memory capabilities are better suited for complex classification tasks involving domain-specific language like legal text.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have been shown to respond in a variety of ways for classification tasks outside of question-answering. LLM responses are sometimes called "hallucinations" since the output is not what is ex pected. Memorization strategies in LLMs are being studied in detail, with the goal of understanding how LLMs respond. We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting.

*Cristina Aggazzotti,Elizabeth Allyn Smith*

TL;DR: The paper proposes StyloSpeaker, a stylometric method to identify speakers based on transcribed speech content, achieving higher performance with normalized transcripts and controlled conversation topics compared to neural methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying speakers from linguistic content when vocal properties are unreliable due to voice disguise or text-to-speech usage.

Method: Developing StyloSpeaker, a stylometric approach utilizing character, word, token, sentence, and style features for speaker attribution from transcribed speech.

Result: StyloSpeaker performs better on normalized transcripts and controlled conversation topics with higher attribution accuracy, comparing favorably to neural approaches.

Conclusion: Stylometric analysis is effective for speaker attribution from speech transcripts, highlighting the importance of stylistic features in distinguishing individuals.

Abstract: Forensic scientists often need to identify an unknown speaker or writer in cases such as ransom calls, covert recordings, alleged suicide notes, or anonymous online communications, among many others. Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalization Editing as a framework addressing challenges in personalizing LLMs, paired with UPQA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating user-specific preference recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve LLM personalization by overcoming the limitations like computational cost, data requirements, degrading performance in multi-turn interactions, and difficulty handling implicit queries.

Method: The framework uses localized edits informed by clustered user preferences, preserving model capabilities while enabling precise personalization. Additionally, a new benchmark dataset, UPQA, evaluates recall of user-specific preferences using user queries with varying complexity.

Result: Personalization Editing framework showed higher editing accuracy and computational efficiency compared to fine-tuning, and outperformed baselines in conversational and implicit preference settings.

Conclusion: Personalization Editing proves effective and efficient for aligning LLMs with user preferences, while UPQA offers a robust evaluation method for recall and accuracy in personalized interactions.

Abstract: Personalization is becoming indispensable for LLMs to align with individual user preferences and needs. Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.

TL;DR: Language models can detect Alzheimer's Disease by analyzing semantic impairment in linguistic outputs, even when surface-level textual patterns are altered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of distinguishing linguistic markers of cognitive decline from superficial textual patterns, aiming to enhance the interpretability of language models in Alzheimer's Disease detection.

Method: The method involved transforming textual outputs by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content, along with testing classification performance and using generative models to assess semantic degradation in image reconstruction tasks.

Result: Semantic impairments were detectable by language models with minimal deviations in performance when surface forms were modified, though image-based transformations introduced noise reducing accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic information alone can help language model classifiers detect Alzheimer's Disease, providing a novel way to analyze linguistic deterioration for early detection.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely affects cognitive abilities. Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems.

Result: The model showed reduced Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4%, enhancing accuracy and robustness under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves action prediction accuracy and provides natural language explanations, enhancing both performance and transparency of smart farming systems in adverse scenarios.

Abstract: Smart farming has emerged as a key technology for advancing modern agriculture through automation and intelligent control. However, systems relying on RGB cameras for perception and robotic manipulators for control, common in smart farming, are vulnerable to photometric perturbations such as hue, illumination, and noise changes, which can cause malfunction under adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on the OpenVLA-OFT framework. The model integrates an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects. Experiments show that the proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to the baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions.

### [134] [Temporal-Anchor3DLane: Enhanced 3D Lane Detection with Multi-Task Losses and LSTM Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11869)
*D. Shainu Suhas,G. Rahul,K. Muni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves on previous 3D lane detection approaches with better loss functions, a lightweight temporal module, and refined training for smoother trajectories and improved F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in Anchor3DLane like sensitivity to regression outliers, weak global supervision, difficulty balancing loss terms, and limited temporal continuity use.

Method: The authors introduced balanced loss optimization, a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module, and ESCOP-style training to enhance 3D lane detection performance while preserving framework efficiency.

Result: The Temporal-Anchor3DLane achieved an F1 improvement of +6.2 on OpenLane and showed smoother temporal trajectories compared to previous models.

Conclusion: Small architectural and loss function adjustments can significantly improve the robustness of monocular 3D lane detection systems without requiring additional sensors.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection remains challenging due to depth ambiguity, occlusion, and temporal instability across frames. Anchor-based approaches such as Anchor3DLane have demonstrated strong performance by regressing continuous 3D lane curves from multi-camera surround views. However, the baseline model still exhibits (i) sensitivity to regression outliers, (ii) weak supervision of global curve geometry, (iii) difficulty in balancing multiple loss terms, and (iv) limited exploitation of temporal continuity. We propose Temporal-Anchor3DLane, an enhanced 3D lane detection framework that extends Anchor3DLane with three key contributions: (1) a set of multi-task loss improvements, including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting, together with focal and Dice components for classification and visibility; (2) a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module that aggregates per-anchor features across frames, replacing a heavier Transformer-style temporal fusion; and (3) ESCOP-style training refinements that couple curve-level supervision with temporal consistency. On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling.

*Tekleab G. Gebremedhin,Hailom S. Asegede,Bruh W. Tesheme,Tadesse B. Gebremichael,Kalayu G. Redae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on an offline-first system for crop disease diagnosis in Ethiopia, using a cactus-fig dataset and benchmarking mobile-efficient architectures like CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and MobileViT-XS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Tigray region of Ethiopia faces challenges in accessing crop disease diagnostics due to infrastructural issues, requiring accessible, offline tools to enhance food security in post-conflict areas.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of 3,587 cactus-fig images and benchmarked models (lightweight CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and MobileViT-XS) for deployment in an offline mobile app localized in Tigrigna and Amharic.

Result: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieved 90.7% accuracy, lightweight CNN 89.5% with 42 ms latency, and MobileViT-XS excelled with 97.3% accuracy, proving its global reasoning power over CNNs.

Conclusion: The system shows promising capabilities for offline crop disease diagnostics, balancing accuracy and deployment efficiency while supporting food security in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Agriculture supports over 80% of the population in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where infrastructural disruptions limit access to expert crop disease diagnosis. We present an offline-first detection system centered on a newly curated indigenous cactus-fig (Opuntia ficus-indica) dataset consisting of 3,587 field images across three core symptom classes. Given deployment constraints in post-conflict edge environments, we benchmark three mobile-efficient architectures: a custom lightweight CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and the CNN-Transformer hybrid MobileViT-XS. While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels. The ARM compatible models are deployed in a Tigrigna and Amharic localized Flutter application supporting fully offline inference on Cortex-A53 class devices, strengthening inclusivity for food security critical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares SAM3 in zero-shot mode with fine-tuned YOLO11 variants on dense instance segmentation tasks, specifically on the MinneApple dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a thorough comparison between generalized zero-shot segmentation and specialized fine-tuned models in dense environments, helping choose the optimal methodology for instance segmentation.

Method: Evaluated SAM3 and YOLO11 (nano, medium, large) variants on the MinneApple dataset, analyzing their F1-scores, IoU thresholds, and performance stability under occlusion and density challenges.

Result: YOLO models outperformed SAM3 in F1 scores (68.9-72.2% vs. 59.8%) but degraded significantly over IoU ranges. SAM3 displayed higher boundary stability with a minimal drop in performance.

Conclusion: SAM3 is more precise in mask definitions while YOLO11 excels in detection completeness, indicating the preferable use case for each type of model in dense segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced two fundamentally different paradigms for instance segmentation: specialized models optimized through task-specific fine-tuning and generalist foundation models capable of zero-shot segmentation. This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11. We provide open-source code, evaluation pipelines, and methodological recommendations, contributing to a deeper understanding of when specialized fine-tuned models or generalist foundation models are preferable for dense instance segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmWeaver synthesizes realistic mmWave signals using Implicit Neural Representations, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in activity recognition and pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mmWave applications rely on diverse, environment-specific datasets, but simulation is computationally expensive due to signal complexity.

Method: mmWeaver uses hypernetworks to generate INR parameters from environment/context and motion features, enabling adaptive signal synthesis.

Result: Improved activity recognition accuracy by 7% and reduced pose estimation error by 15%, operating faster (6-35x) than simulations, with high signal realism metrics.

Conclusion: mmWeaver successfully addresses signal complexity and computational inefficiencies, enhancing mmWave application performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Realistic signal generation and dataset augmentation are essential for advancing mmWave radar applications such as activity recognition and pose estimation, which rely heavily on diverse, and environment-specific signal datasets. However, mmWave signals are inherently complex, sparse, and high-dimensional, making physical simulation computationally expensive. This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hot Hém, a GeoAI framework for assessing and routing pedestrian heat exposure in tropical city environments like Hô Chí Minh City using Google Street View images and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian heat exposure poses a serious health risk in densely populated tropical cities, but traditional routing algorithms ignore variations in thermal conditions at the micro-scale.

Method: The authors developed a spatial data pipeline combining Google Street View imagery, semantic segmentation, and XGBoost models to predict land surface temperatures. These models were applied to pedestrian networks for heat-aware routing.

Result: The workflow successfully maps pedestrian heat exposure and provides insights into urban corridors experiencing higher temperatures.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable tool to analyze urban heat distribution and emphasizes the importance of incorporating thermal conditions into urban planning for dense cities.

Abstract: Pedestrian heat exposure is a critical health risk in dense tropical cities, yet standard routing algorithms often ignore micro-scale thermal variation. Hot Hém is a GeoAI workflow that estimates and operationalizes pedestrian heat exposure in Hô Chí Minh City (HCMC), Vi\d{e}t Nam, colloquially known as Sài Gòn. This spatial data science pipeline combines Google Street View (GSV) imagery, semantic image segmentation, and remote sensing. Two XGBoost models are trained to predict land surface temperature (LST) using a GSV training dataset in selected administrative wards, known as phŏng, and are deployed in a patchwork manner across all OSMnx-derived pedestrian network nodes to enable heat-aware routing. This is a model that, when deployed, can provide a foundation for pinpointing where and further understanding why certain city corridors may experience disproportionately higher temperatures at an infrastructural scale.

TL;DR: This paper provides open microscopic vehicle trajectory datasets, recorded via UAVs in dense, heterogeneous urban traffic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations of traditional roadside traffic video collection methods, such as occlusion and inadequate capturing of mixed traffic dynamics.

Method: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recorded datasets from six mid-block locations using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform, offering high-resolution timestamps and validated data.

Result: The datasets highlight traffic patterns like lane-keeping, speed distributions, and lateral maneuvers in diverse urban traffic conditions, ensuring rich spatial-temporal insights.

Conclusion: These datasets enable global researchers to improve traffic modeling, safety studies, and behavioral analyses for complex urban traffic scenarios.

Abstract: This paper offers openly available microscopic vehicle trajectory (MVT) datasets collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in heterogeneous, area-based urban traffic conditions. Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions. By making these empirical datasets openly available, this work offers researchers a unique opportunity to develop, test, and validate models that more accurately represent complex urban traffic environments.

*Futa Waseda,Shojiro Yamabe,Daiki Shiono,Kento Sasaki,Tsubasa Takahashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIO-VQA and RIO-Bench, focusing on selective text usage in LVLMs to address typographic attacks and achieve balanced robustness in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of LVLMs to misleading text and the lack of joint reasoning over objects and text, crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a novel task (RIO-VQA), a benchmark dataset (RIO-Bench), and counterfactual evaluation protocols to study selective text usage. They further introduce a novel adaptive data-driven defense method.

Result: Evaluation using RIO-Bench shows LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance text robustness and reading capability. The proposed adaptive method improves selective text use.

Conclusion: The study reveals a misalignment between current evaluation methods and practical requirements, and introduces improved approaches for LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/.

Motivation: To develop a flexible and efficient multimodal representation learning architecture that can handle diverse tasks and missing modality inputs, while improving robustness and accuracy.

Method: CLARGA employs a multi-head Graph Attention Network that learns attention-weighted graphs for multimodal feature fusion. It uses a hybrid training objective combining supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss for improved cross-modal consistency.

Result: CLARGA demonstrated superior performance across tasks in seven datasets covering various domains, showing robustness to noisy and missing inputs and excelling in niche tasks.

Conclusion: CLARGA is a versatile and efficient multimodal fusion architecture that adapts to a wide range of machine learning tasks by integrating different modalities with high performance and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce CLARGA, a general-purpose multimodal fusion architecture for multimodal representation learning that works with any number and type of modalities without changing the underlying framework. Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks. Overall, CLARGA can be easily plugged into machine learning models for effective and efficient learning of representations across a wide variety of tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses deep learning to measure smile intensity in smartphone videos as a marker of positive emotion, showing strong correlations with happiness surveys and behavioral patterns, suggesting a scalable way to assess well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current well-being measurements rely on self-reports, leading to biases and high participant burden. A need exists for more objective and scalable methods to study emotional behavior in real-life contexts.

Method: The study analyzed over 405,000 smartphone video clips from 233 participants using deep learning to quantify smile intensity and examined patterns against physical activity, light exposure, and national happiness surveys.

Result: The researchers identified strong correlations between smile intensity and happiness survey data (r=0.92), as well as diurnal mood patterns (r=0.80). Positive associations with physical activity and light exposure were found, but none with smartphone use.

Conclusion: Passive smartphone sensing is a viable and ecologically valid method to study affective behavior, offering the potential for large-scale applications in well-being research.

Abstract: Subjective well-being is a cornerstone of individual and societal health, yet its scientific measurement has traditionally relied on self-report methods prone to recall bias and high participant burden. This has left a gap in our understanding of well-being as it is expressed in everyday life. We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use. These findings suggest that passive smartphone sensing could serve as a powerful, ecologically valid methodology for studying the dynamics of affective behavior and open the door to understanding this behavior at a population scale.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that generates diagnostic pathology reports from whole slide images efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in generating pathology reports from whole slide images due to high morphological variability and complex narrative structures.

Method: MPath uses a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) and conditions it on visual embeddings extracted from WSIs through a visual-prefix prompting mechanism. It leverages WSI features without requiring full vision-language pretraining, using a compact projection module, which keeps the language component stable and data-efficient.

Result: MPath ranked 4th in the RED 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating its effectiveness despite limited submission opportunities.

Conclusion: The approach shows that prompt-based multimodal conditioning provides a scalable, efficient, and interpretable way to generate pathology reports from WSIs.

Abstract: Automated generation of diagnostic pathology reports directly from whole slide images (WSIs) is an emerging direction in computational pathology. Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.

TL;DR: FloraForge leverages LLMs to create accurate, editable 3D plant models for science applications, addressing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in building accurate 3D plant models for phenotyping and simulation, as current methods are either training-intensive or require specialized expertise.

Method: FloraForge utilizes an LLM-assisted framework where domain scientists refine Python scripts to generate biologically accurate procedural plant models using B-spline surfaces with botanical constraints.

Result: The framework successfully models plants like maize, soybean, and mung bean from empirical data, producing both visualization and analysis-ready outputs.

Conclusion: FloraForge democratizes complex geometric modeling for plant scientists, combining computational precision with accessibility and editability.

Abstract: Accurate 3D plant models are crucial for computational phenotyping and physics-based simulation; however, current approaches face significant limitations. Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of detecting objects in distant regions with sparse LiDAR data, which is crucial for autonomous driving.

Method: It introduces TransBridge, a transformer-based up-sampling block that integrates detection and completion features, along with a DSRecon module for dense point cloud generation.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Waymo datasets show improvements in mean average precision (mAP), with gains up to 5.78 points in certain detection frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances 3D object detection performance, is cost-effective, and demonstrates generalizability across multiple methods and datasets.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential in autonomous driving, providing vital information about moving objects and obstacles. Detecting objects in distant regions with only a few LiDAR points is still a challenge, and numerous strategies have been developed to address point cloud sparsity through densification.This paper presents a joint completion and detection framework that improves the detection feature in sparse areas while maintaining costs unchanged. Specifically, we propose TransBridge, a novel transformer-based up-sampling block that fuses the features from the detection and completion networks.The detection network can benefit from acquiring implicit completion features derived from the completion network. Additionally, we design the Dynamic-Static Reconstruction (DSRecon) module to produce dense LiDAR data for the completion network, meeting the requirement for dense point cloud ground truth.Furthermore, we employ the transformer mechanism to establish connections between channels and spatial relations, resulting in a high-resolution feature map used for completion purposes.Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.The results show that our framework consistently improves end-to-end 3D object detection, with the mean average precision (mAP) ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 across multiple methods, indicating its generalization ability. For the two-stage detection framework, it also boosts the mAP up to 5.78 points.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces MONET, a diffusion model trained on brightfield images to predict cell paint channels, addressing labor-intensiveness and fixation issues in cell painting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell painting, despite its popularity in studying cell morphology, is labor-intensive and incompatible with dynamic cellular studies due to chemical fixation.

Method: A diffusion model (MONET) was trained using a large dataset to predict cell paint channels from brightfield images, employing a consistency architecture for time-lapse video generation and in-context learning for adaptability.

Result: MONET can generate virtual cell painting and time-lapse videos without requiring real video training data, showing adaptability to different protocols and cell lines.

Conclusion: Virtual cell painting complements physical cell painting, offering potential for novel workflows in biological research while addressing limitations in dynamics and labor.

Abstract: Cell painting is a popular technique for creating human-interpretable, high-contrast images of cell morphology. There are two major issues with cell paint: (1) it is labor-intensive and (2) it requires chemical fixation, making the study of cell dynamics impossible. We train a diffusion model (Morphological Observation Neural Enhancement Tool, or MONET) on a large dataset to predict cell paint channels from brightfield images. We show that model quality improves with scale. The model uses a consistency architecture to generate time-lapse videos, despite the impossibility of obtaining cell paint video training data. In addition, we show that this architecture enables a form of in-context learning, allowing the model to partially transfer to out-of-distribution cell lines and imaging protocols. Virtual cell painting is not intended to replace physical cell painting completely, but to act as a complementary tool enabling novel workflows in biological research.

Result: The proposed HEMC-CPS model demonstrates its ability to achieve effective unsupervised segmentation on both synthetic and real images, showing potential for handling more complex images.

Conclusion: HEMC-CPS can model and segment complex image data and handle spatially correlated data, with potential applications beyond image segmentation such as multi-sensor and multi-resolution data analysis.

Abstract: Transforming bi-dimensional sets of image pixels into mono-dimensional sequences with a Peano scan (PS) is an established technique enabling the use of hidden Markov chains (HMCs) for unsupervised image segmentation. Related Bayesian segmentation methods can compete with hidden Markov fields (HMFs)-based ones and are much faster. PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC. We show its effectiveness for Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation using synthetic and real images. Segmentation is performed in an unsupervised manner, with parameters being estimated using the stochastic expectation--maximization (SEM) method. The new HEMC-CPS model presents potential for the modeling and segmentation of more complex images, such as three-dimensional or multi-sensor multi-resolution images. Finally, the HMC-CPS and HEMC-CPS models are not limited to image segmentation and could be used for any kind of spatially correlated data.

*Jingmin Zhu,Anqi Zhu,James Bailey,Jun Liu,Hossein Rahmani,Mohammed Bennamoun,Farid Boussaid,Qiuhong Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaPURLS is a zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition framework enhancing domain transfer by using multi-scale visual-semantic alignment and dynamic inference-time refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to effectively transfer knowledge for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition because they align static features with class-level semantics, failing to address the domain gap between seen and unseen classes.

Method: DynaPURLS employs a large language model to generate hierarchical semantic descriptions and an adaptive module to create fine-grained visual representations. A dynamic refinement module ensures robust alignment by adapting semantics during inference with a confidence-aware memory bank.

Result: DynaPURLS demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous approaches on benchmark datasets like NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, setting state-of-the-art records.

Conclusion: DynaPURLS effectively tackles domain shifts in zero-shot action recognition by facilitating dynamic, fine-grained visual-semantic alignment, proving its superiority through extensive evaluations.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZS-SAR) is fundamentally constrained by prevailing approaches that rely on aligning skeleton features with static, class-level semantics. This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models like DeiT prove effective in improving wafer defect detection, supporting predictive maintenance processes under challenging data conditions.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance is an important sector in modern industries which improves fault detection and cost reduction processes. By using machine learning algorithms in the whole process, the defects detection process can be implemented smoothly. Semiconductor is a sensitive maintenance field that requires predictability in work. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG-19, Xception and Squeeze-Net have demonstrated solid performance in image classification for semiconductor wafer industry, their effectiveness often declines in scenarios with limited and imbalanced data. This study investigates the use of the Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) for classifying wafer map defects under data-constrained conditions. Experimental results reveal that the DeiT model achieves highest classification accuracy of 90.83%, outperforming CNN models such as VGG-19(65%), SqueezeNet(82%), Xception(66%) and Hybrid(67%). DeiT also demonstrated superior F1-score (90.78%) and faster training convergence, with enhanced robustness in detecting minority defect classes. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based models like DeiT in semiconductor wafer defect detection and support predictive maintenance strategies within semiconductor fabrication processes.

*Xianghui Xie,Bowen Wen,Yan Chang,Hesam Rabeti,Jiefeng Li,Ye Yuan,Gerard Pons-Moll,Stan Birchfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARI4D, a method for reconstructing human-object interactions in 4D from monocular RGB videos, achieving significant improvements over prior approaches without being constrained by object categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding 4D human-object interactions is crucial for domains like human behavior analysis, gaming, and robotics. Current methods struggle due to the challenges of unknown objects, occlusions, and complex movements, often requiring restrictive assumptions or prior knowledge.

Method: The authors propose CARI4D, using a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that integrates predictions from foundation models. It refines results with a render-and-compare paradigm ensuring spatial, temporal, and pixel alignment, and incorporates contact reasoning for physically consistent refinement.

Result: CARI4D achieves 38% lower reconstruction error on an in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. The method generalizes to new categories and can handle real-world online videos without prior object-specific training.

Conclusion: CARI4D represents a significant advance in the reconstruction of 4D human-object interactions from monocular videos, being category-agnostic, robust, and applicable to diverse settings. The method ensures improved accuracy and generalization, setting a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Accurate capture of human-object interaction from ubiquitous sensors like RGB cameras is important for applications in human understanding, gaming, and robot learning. However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error. Our model generalizes beyond the training categories and thus can be applied zero-shot to in-the-wild internet videos. Our code and pretrained models will be publicly released.

*Chenrui Fan,Yijun Liang,Shweta Bhardwaj,Kwesi Cobbina,Ming Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation suite, 'V-REX,' designed to assess visual reasoning tasks requiring multi-step exploration, analyzing capabilities like planning and following in visual-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex, open-ended visual reasoning tasks due to lack of structure for intermediate exploratory steps.

Method: They propose 'V-REX,' a benchmark and evaluation protocol using Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) to test the planning and following abilities of VLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Result: Assessment of state-of-the-art VLMs highlights scaling trends, gaps between planning and following abilities, and areas for improvement in multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: The introduction of V-REX aids fine-grained quantitative evaluation of VLMs, paving the way for advancements in complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While many vision-language models (VLMs) are developed to answer well-defined, straightforward questions with highly specified targets, as in most benchmarks, they often struggle in practice with complex open-ended tasks, which usually require multiple rounds of exploration and reasoning in the visual space. Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning.

*Antonio Guillen-Perez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic-Drive is a framework for mining rare safety-critical events from AV video logs locally and efficiently using neuro-symbolic methods, outperforming existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of long-tail, rare safety-critical training data for autonomous vehicles, and manual identification is costly and inefficient.

Method: Semantic-Drive employs a local-first neuro-symbolic framework consisting of symbolic grounding using YOLOE and cognitive analysis with a reasoning VLM, alongside a System 2 inference alignment strategy.

Result: Semantic-Drive achieved a recall of 0.966 (compared to 0.475 for CLIP) and reduced risk assessment error by 40% on benchmark datasets, all while utilizing consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates an efficient, privacy-preserving solution for semantic data mining that could overcome critical data identification bottlenecks in AV development.

Abstract: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\% compared to single models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.

TL;DR: The study introduces DDGNN for human activity recognition using mmWave radar data, achieving high classification accuracy and better performance than existing methods without intensive preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sparsity and variable-size issues in mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR systems, and improve spatial-temporal feature extraction without relying on vision-based preprocessing algorithms.

Method: A discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) was proposed with a star graph representation. This models spatial-temporal features of radar points, integrating a manually added static center relative to dynamic radar points.

Result: The proposed method achieved 94.27% accuracy on HAR datasets, slightly below vision-based methods’ 97.25%, while outperforming existing radar-specific techniques without preprocessing algorithms.

Conclusion: DDGNN enables effective human activity recognition using mmWave radar data with computationally efficient solutions, suitable for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) requires extracting accurate spatial-temporal features with human movements. A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design. Our system also outperformed three recent radar-specific methods without requiring resampling or frame aggregators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a privacy-preserving method for ship detection in satellite imagery, avoiding centralized data collection especially for sensitive or commercially valuable datasets.

Method: The study evaluates four FL models (FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and FedMedian), measuring their effectiveness against a baseline model where YOLOv8 is trained independently on separate datasets.

Result: FL models improved ship detection accuracy and performed similarly to global training, which uses centralized data. Appropriate FL settings are crucial for balancing precision and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Federated Learning is a viable method for ship detection in satellite imagery, offering high accuracy while protecting data privacy. Tuning FL configurations is essential for optimization.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Federated Learning (FL) for ship detection across diverse satellite datasets, offering a privacy-preserving solution that eliminates the need for data sharing or centralized collection. This approach is particularly advantageous for handling commercial satellite imagery or sensitive ship annotations. Four FL models including FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and FedMedian, are evaluated and compared to a local training baseline, where the YOLOv8 ship detection model is independently trained on each dataset without sharing learned parameters. The results reveal that FL models substantially improve detection accuracy over training on smaller local datasets and achieve performance levels close to global training that uses all datasets during the training. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate FL configurations, such as the number of communication rounds and local training epochs, to optimize detection precision while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised semantic segmentation workflow to improve burned area mapping post-wildfire, focusing on performance and efficiency using SPOT-6/7 imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is critical for assessing wildfire damage and aiding ecosystem recovery. Existing methods often fail in time-sensitive emergency scenarios.

Method: The study implements supervised semantic segmentation using SPOT-6/7 imagery, evaluating models like U-Net and SegFormer while exploring auxiliary land cover data and Test-Time Augmentation techniques.

Result: U-Net and SegFormer performed similarly with limited training data, though SegFormer required more resources. Land cover data improved robustness, and Test-Time Augmentation enhanced performance but increased inference time.

Conclusion: The method achieves accurate BA mapping with considerations for both performance and efficiency. However, optimization strategies are necessary for practical emergency applications.

Abstract: After a wildfire, delineating burned areas (BAs) is crucial for quantifying damages and supporting ecosystem recovery. Current BA mapping approaches rely on computer vision models trained on post-event remote sensing imagery, but often overlook their applicability to time-constrained emergency management scenarios. This study introduces a supervised semantic segmentation workflow aimed at boosting both the performance and efficiency of BA delineation. It targets SPOT-6/7 imagery due to its very high resolution and on-demand availability. Experiments are evaluated based on Dice score, Intersection over Union, and inference time. The results show that U-Net and SegFormer models perform similarly with limited training data. However, SegFormer requires more resources, challenging its practical use in emergencies. Incorporating land cover data as an auxiliary task enhances model robustness without increasing inference time. Lastly, Test-Time Augmentation improves BA delineation performance but raises inference time, which can be mitigated with optimization methods like Mixed Precision.

*Tejas Panambur,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Chongjian Ge,Ersin Yumer,Xue Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreativeVR introduces a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework that excels in handling severe structural and temporal artifacts in AI-generated and real-world videos, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of current video restoration methods that struggle to address structural failures and artifacts in both AI-generated and degraded real-world videos.

Method: CreativeVR leverages a deep-adapter-based approach featuring a temporally coherent degradation module, enabling precise control over restoration through adjustable fidelity and perceptual quality.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on videos with severe artifacts, demonstrating practical throughput while maintaining competitive results on standard restoration benchmarks.

Conclusion: CreativeVR provides an effective solution for artifact restoration in videos, combining restoration with structural corrections and temporal coherence, marking significant progress in video processing.

Abstract: Modern text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet they remain brittle at fine-scale structure: even state-of-the-art generators often produce distorted faces and hands, warped backgrounds, and temporally inconsistent motion. Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.
  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.
  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

*Ryan Po,Eric Ryan Chan,Changan Chen,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Backwards Aggregation" (BAgger), a self-supervised method to address exposure bias in autoregressive video models during next-frame prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video models face challenges of exposure bias, where errors accumulate and quality drifts during inference due to training on clean contexts but relying on self-generated frames at inference.

Method: BAgger generates corrective trajectories from the model's rollouts, and uses score or flow matching objectives for training. It avoids using large teacher models or long-chain backpropagation.

Result: Implemented on causal diffusion transformers, BAgger shows improved long-horizon motion stability, reduced drift, and enhanced visual consistency across tasks such as text-to-video, video extension, and multi-prompt generation.

Conclusion: BAgger effectively mitigates exposure bias in video models, leading to higher quality and greater stability in video predictions, while maintaining diversity and avoiding drawbacks of prior methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive video models are promising for world modeling via next-frame prediction, but they suffer from exposure bias: a mismatch between training on clean contexts and inference on self-generated frames, causing errors to compound and quality to drift over time. We introduce Backwards Aggregation (BAgger), a self-supervised scheme that constructs corrective trajectories from the model's own rollouts, teaching it to recover from its mistakes. Unlike prior approaches that rely on few-step distillation and distribution-matching losses, which can hurt quality and diversity, BAgger trains with standard score or flow matching objectives, avoiding large teachers and long-chain backpropagation through time. We instantiate BAgger on causal diffusion transformers and evaluate on text-to-video, video extension, and multi-prompt generation, observing more stable long-horizon motion and better visual consistency with reduced drift.

*Guanfang Dong,Luke Schultz,Negar Hassanpour,Chao Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RePack, a framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by transforming high-dimensional vision foundation model (VFM) representations into compact representations to enhance performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) offer powerful semantic representations, but directly injecting high-dimensional VFM features into latent diffusion models (LDMs) can cause information overload due to high dimensionality. This paper aims to address this limitation, while leveraging their rich semantics.

Method: RePack projects high-dimensional VFM representations onto low-dimensional manifolds to create compact and decoder-friendly representations for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). This process removes non-semantic noise while preserving structural information for better image reconstruction.

Result: RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence (35% faster than the current state-of-the-art) and achieves strong performance, obtaining an FID of 3.66 on DiT-XL/2 in just 64 epochs.

Conclusion: RePack successfully reduces the dimensionality of VFM representations, bypasses information overload issues, accelerates training, and improves image generation fidelity, making it effective for enhancing VFMs in LDMs.

Abstract: The superior representation capability of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) has been harnessed for enhancing latent diffusion models (LDMs). These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects.

*Zihu Wang,Boxun Xu,Yuxuan Xia,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces VEGAS, a method leveraging vision encoder's attention maps to reduce hallucinations in large vision-language models by integrating them into the language model's middle layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of hallucinations in large vision-language models, where outputs are fluent but factually inconsistent with visual evidence.

Method: The method involves analyzing visual-text conflicts and injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers to suppress hallucinations adaptively during token generation.

Result: VEGAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, effectively reducing hallucinations in outputs.

Conclusion: Utilizing the vision encoder’s concentrated attention maps during decoding significantly reduces hallucinations in large vision-language models, enhancing their factual accuracy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive ability to jointly reason over visual and textual inputs. However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations.

### [161] [SPDMark: Selective Parameter Displacement for Robust Video Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12090)
*Samar Fares,Nurbek Tastan,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPDMark introduces a novel framework for video watermarking using selective parameter displacement in generative diffusion models, offering imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of high-quality video generation models necessitates reliable watermarking schemes to detect and track video provenance amidst increasing concerns about authenticity.

Method: SPDMark embeds watermarks by modifying selective generative model parameters using a basis shift approach with low-rank adaptation during training, optimizing for message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency. It leverages cryptographic hashing for frame-specific watermarking and employs bipartite matching for tampered video recovery.

Result: The framework successfully generates imperceptible watermarks, demonstrating robust recovery across tampered and common video modifications in text-to-video and image-to-video models.

Conclusion: SPDMark achieves imperceptible, robust, and computationally efficient video watermarking, enabling secure tracking of generated video provenance.

Abstract: The advent of high-quality video generation models has amplified the need for robust watermarking schemes that can be used to reliably detect and track the provenance of generated videos. Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.

DIHM images, however, were significantly lower in performance (8.15% detection mAP50, 50% accuracy), improved slightly using bounding box alignment, GAN-based data augmentation improved DIHM detection accuracy to 15.4%.

Conclusion: GAN-based augmentation notably narrows the performance gap in DIHM and optical image pollen detection, advancing the feasibility of automated DIHM workflows, particularly for veterinary imaging applications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EchoGround-MIMIC, a large-scale, clinically grounded echocardiography dataset, and proposes EchoVLM, a vision-language model achieving state-of-the-art results in echocardiographic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the labor-intensive, multimodal nature of echocardiographic interpretation and the lack of datasets and tools enabling advanced analysis.

Method: The authors created the EchoGround-MIMIC dataset and developed EchoVLM, incorporating view-informed and negation-aware contrastive loss pretraining objectives.

Result: EchoVLM demonstrated exceptional performance in various echocardiography tasks, achieving 86.5% AUC in disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification.

Conclusion: The work establishes EchoVLM as a foundational model for echocardiography, highlighting the importance of clinically grounded pretraining. The resources will be released for future research.

Abstract: Echocardiography is the most widely used imaging modality in cardiology, yet its interpretation remains labor-intensive and inherently multimodal, requiring view recognition, quantitative measurements, qualitative assessments, and guideline-based reasoning. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved broad success in natural images and certain medical domains, their potential in echocardiography has been limited by the lack of large-scale, clinically grounded image-text datasets and the absence of measurement-based reasoning central to echo interpretation. We introduce EchoGround-MIMIC, the first measurement-grounded multimodal echocardiography dataset, comprising 19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and guideline-derived disease labels. Building on this resource, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model that incorporates two novel pretraining objectives: (i) a view-informed contrastive loss that encodes the view-dependent structure of echocardiographic imaging, and (ii) a negation-aware contrastive loss that distinguishes clinically critical negative from positive findings. Across five types of clinical applications with 36 tasks spanning multimodal disease classification, image-text retrieval, view classification, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection, EchoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification). We demonstrate that clinically grounded multimodal pretraining yields transferable visual representations and establish EchoVLM as a foundation model for end-to-end echocardiography interpretation. We will release EchoGround-MIMIC and the data curation code, enabling reproducibility and further research in multimodal echocardiography interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel patch-based method for extracting topological features from 3D CT images using persistent homology, yielding improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the limitations of 3D cubical complex filtration for constructing persistent homology from high-resolution 3D CT images, aiming to enhance model performance and efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes a patch-based persistent homology construction approach specifically designed for volumetric CT imaging data, compared through benchmarks against standard 3D cubical complex filtration methods.

Result: The patch-based method achieved significant improvements across classification metrics (accuracy +10.38%, AUC +6.94%, sensitivity +2.06%, specificity +11.58%, F1 +8.51%) and superior time-efficiency over cubical complex method.

Conclusion: The patch-based method for persistent homology construction demonstrates dominance in classification and efficiency, with practical applicability supported by the development of an accessible Python package.

Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) models based on computed tomography (CT) imaging modality has been a major focus of recent research in the medical imaging domain. Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets. Finally, we provide a convenient python package, Patch-TDA, to facilitate the utilization of the proposed approach.

*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Raisa Karnik,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the largest benchmark dataset for post-disaster road assessments, addresses limitations in prior datasets, and deploys 18 ML models validated in disaster responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale, high-resolution, operationally validated datasets for post-disaster road damage assessment and alignment.

Method: Data labeling of 657.25km of roads with a 10-class schema, development of 18 ML models, and the use of road line adjustments to mitigate misalignment.

Result: Baseline models were deployed, with spatial misalignment shown to degrade performance by 5.596% on average. Spatially aligned data improves accuracy and reduces labeling errors.

Conclusion: The study provides a pivotal dataset, showcases operational use of ML models, and highlights gaps for improvement in disaster-response ML, CV, and robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents the largest known benchmark dataset for road damage assessment and road alignment, and provides 18 baseline models trained on the CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset's post-disaster small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery from 10 federally declared disasters, addressing three challenges within prior post-disaster road damage assessment datasets. While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters.

### [166] [MeltwaterBench: Deep learning for spatiotemporal downscaling of surface meltwater](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12142)
*Björn Lütjens,Patrick Alexander,Raf Antwerpen,Til Widmann,Guido Cervone,Marco Tedesco*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of mapping high-resolution surface meltwater on the Greenland ice sheet using remote sensing and deep learning to overcome existing temporal-spatial tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which is not fully understood, the authors aim to improve the resolution and accuracy of surface meltwater maps.

Method: A deep learning model was developed to downscale and fuse remote sensing data (SAR and PMW) and model predictions (RCM) into daily, 100m resolution meltwater maps. Standard architectures like UNet and DeepLabv3+ were tested, and SAR data was used as ground truth.

Result: The deep learning model achieved 95% accuracy, surpassing non-deep learning methods based on RCM (83%) and PMW (72%). An alternative SAR-only running window method achieved 90% accuracy but underestimated extreme melt events.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach provides higher accuracy for meltwater mapping, highlighting its potential for understanding climate impacts on Greenland glaciers. A benchmark dataset, MeltwaterBench, was introduced for future research.

Abstract: The Greenland ice sheet is melting at an accelerated rate due to processes that are not fully understood and hard to measure. The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as "ground truth", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates open-set recognition (OSR) and few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) using CIFAR-10 to analyze model performance on known and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the deployment of models in open-world settings so they can handle known categories effectively and respond reliably to new, novel data.

Method: The study uses pretrained visual encoders (ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, CLIP ViT-B/16) for OSR, with linear probes and scoring mechanisms. For FSCIL, prototype-based methods (modified SPPR, OrCo, ConCM) with partially frozen ResNet-50 are tested under different shot scenarios.

Result: CLIP consistently outperforms other backbones in OSR across scoring functions, while ConCM achieves the highest accuracy in FSCIL, particularly in 10-shot scenarios, showing good performance in managing unknown detection and catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The study concludes that backbone architecture and scoring mechanisms significantly impact unknown detection, while prototype-based approaches mitigate catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning.

Abstract: Open-world deployment requires models to recognize both known categories and remain reliable when novel classes appear. We present a unified experimental study spanning open-set recognition (OSR) and few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) on CIFAR-10. For OSR, we compare three pretrained frozen visual encoders: ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny and CLIP ViT-B/16,using a linear probe and four post-hoc scoring functions, namely MSP, Energy, Mahalanobis and kNN. Across metrics,such as, AUROC, AUPR, FPR@95, and OSCR, CLIP consistently yields the strongest separability between known and unknown samples, with Energy providing the most stable performance across backbones. For FSCIL, we compare modified SPPR, OrCo, and ConCM using partially frozen ResNet-50 across 1-, 5-, and 10-shot scenarios. ConCM achieves 84.7% accuracy in the 10-shot setting with the cleanest confusion matrix, while all methods show saturation beyond 5 shots. Our controlled evaluation reveals how the backbone architecture and scoring mechanisms affect unknown detection and how prototype-based methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting during incremental adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual methods for camera motion understanding struggle under conditions like motion blur or occlusions. The paper hypothesizes that audio signals could complement visual cues for better performance in such situations.

Method: The authors introduce an audio-visual framework combining direction-of-arrival (DOA) spectra and binaural embeddings with a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model.

Result: Tests on two large datasets show improved performance over visual baselines and robust results under visual corruption conditions.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility of incidental audio as a complementary signal for camera pose estimation, providing a novel approach to solving spatial challenges in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding camera motion is a fundamental problem in embodied perception and 3D scene understanding. While visual methods have advanced rapidly, they often struggle under visually degraded conditions such as motion blur or occlusions. In this work, we show that passive scene sounds provide complementary cues for relative camera pose estimation for in-the-wild videos. We introduce a simple but effective audio-visual framework that integrates direction-ofarrival (DOA) spectra and binauralized embeddings into a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model. Our results on two large datasets show consistent gains over strong visual baselines, plus robustness when the visual information is corrupted. To our knowledge, this represents the first work to successfully leverage audio for relative camera pose estimation in real-world videos, and it establishes incidental, everyday audio as an unexpected but promising signal for a classic spatial challenge.

*Xuancheng Xu,Yaning Li,Sisi You,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMRABooth proposes a method for customized text-to-video generation that improves subject appearance preservation and motion consistency using object-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods struggle to simultaneously ensure subject appearance similarity and motion pattern consistency due to insufficient object-level guidance.

Method: SMRABooth employs a self-supervised encoder for subject representation, an optical flow encoder for motion representation, and a decoupling strategy for subject-motion association during LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show SMRABooth excels in maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns for customizable videos.

Conclusion: SMRABooth effectively advances controllable text-to-video generation through improved subject and motion customization strategies.

Abstract: Customized video generation aims to produce videos that faithfully preserve the subject's appearance from reference images while maintaining temporally consistent motion from reference videos. Existing methods struggle to ensure both subject appearance similarity and motion pattern consistency due to the lack of object-level guidance for subject and motion. To address this, we propose SMRABooth, which leverages the self-supervised encoder and optical flow encoder to provide object-level subject and motion representations. These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs. Extensive experiments show that SMRABooth excels in subject and motion customization, maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns, proving its effectiveness in controllable text-to-video generation.

TL;DR: A novel method for wildfire perimeter tracking using lightweight algorithms suitable for micro UAVs in limited bandwidth environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, reliable tracking method for micro UAVs operating in wildfire reconnaissance under bandwidth, size, and GPS limitations.

Method: Adaptive thermal thresholds, RGB gradient filtering, and rule-based boundary merging, combined with inertial feedback and low-latency processing on SoC platforms.

Result: Improved path stability, reduced jitter, and adequate boundary coverage in wildfire simulation tests with minimal computational and battery costs.

Conclusion: This technique ensures efficient emergency reconnaissance, supporting stable, rapid operation of UAVs in wildfire conditions with minimal communication requirements.

Abstract: This study introduces a lightweight perimeter tracking method designed for micro UAV teams operating over wildfire environments under limited bandwidth conditions. Thermal image frames generate coarse hot region masks through adaptive thresholding and morphological refinement, while RGB frames contribute edge cues and suppress texture related false detections using gradient based filtering. A rule level merging strategy selects boundary candidates and simplifies them via the Ramer Douglas Peucker algorithm. The system incorporates periodic beacons and an inertial feedback loop that maintains trajectory stability in the presence of GPS degradation. The guidance loop targets sub 50 ms latency on embedded System on Chip (SoC) platforms by constraining per frame pixel operations and precomputing gradient tables. Small scale simulations demonstrate reductions in average path length and boundary jitter compared to a pure edge tracking baseline, while maintaining environmental coverage measured through intersection merge analysis. Battery consumption and computational utilization confirm the feasibility of achieving 10, 15 m/s forward motion on standard micro platforms. This approach enables rapid deployment in the field, requiring robust sensing and minimal communications for emergency reconnaissance applications.

Abstract: We present a large-scale, longitudinal visual dataset of urban streetlights captured by 22 fixed-angle cameras deployed across Bristol, U.K., from 2021 to 2025. The dataset contains over 526,000 images, collected hourly under diverse lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. Each image is accompanied by rich metadata, including timestamps, GPS coordinates, and device identifiers. This unique real-world dataset enables detailed investigation of visual drift, anomaly detection, and MLOps strategies in smart city deployments. To promtoe seconardary analysis, we additionally provide a self-supervised framework based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CNN-VAEs). Models are trained separately for each camera node and for day/night image sets. We define two per-sample drift metrics: relative centroid drift, capturing latent space deviation from a baseline quarter, and relative reconstruction error, measuring normalized image-domain degradation. This dataset provides a realistic, fine-grained benchmark for evaluating long-term model stability, drift-aware learning, and deployment-ready vision systems. The images and structured metadata are publicly released in JPEG and CSV formats, supporting reproducibility and downstream applications such as streetlight monitoring, weather inference, and urban scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle distracted driving by improving driver activity recognition using IR-UWB radar, overcoming data scarcity and challenges in adapting Vision Transformers for radar data.

Method: The research created the ALERT dataset with real driving UWB radar samples and developed ISA-ViT, an input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer leveraging sophisticated resizing, positional embeddings, and domain fusion.

Result: ISA-ViT outperformed previous methods by a 22.68% accuracy improvement, showcasing its efficacy in radar-based distracted activity recognition.

Conclusion: This work contributes to combating distracted driving by releasing the ALERT dataset and proposing ISA-ViT, enhancing recognition systems for real-world implementation.

Abstract: Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.
  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.

Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding emotional responses in autistic children during social interactions, which is crucial for developmental psychology and human-robot interaction.

Method: A hybrid deep learning model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based CNN and a three-layer GCN, leveraging facial and geometric features extracted via MediaPipe FaceMesh. Soft-labeling was achieved through an ensemble of DeepFace and FER models, and final classification used a fused embedding optimized with Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Conclusion: The study provides a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset and pipeline for emotion analysis in autistic children using social robotics in India, laying groundwork for personalized assistive technologies.

Abstract: Understanding emotional responses in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during social interaction remains a critical challenge in both developmental psychology and human-robot interaction. This study presents a novel deep learning pipeline for emotion recognition in autistic children in response to a name-calling event by a humanoid robot (NAO), under controlled experimental settings. The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks. Emotions were probabilistically labeled using a weighted ensemble of two models: DeepFace's and FER, each contributing to soft-label generation across seven emotion classes. Final classification leveraged a fused embedding optimized via Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in modeling subtle affective responses and offers significant promise for affective profiling of ASD children in clinical and therapeutic human-robot interaction contexts, as the pipeline effectively captures micro emotional cues in neurodivergent children, addressing a major gap in autism-specific HRI research. This work represents the first such large-scale, real-world dataset and pipeline from India on autism-focused emotion analysis using social robotics, contributing an essential foundation for future personalized assistive technologies.

Motivation: Current models for video synthesis struggle with fine-grained control of cinematic aspects like camera trajectories and genre due to limitations in existing datasets.

Method: The authors created CineLOG by breaking the video generation task into four manageable stages, incorporating a novel Trajectory Guided Transition Module for smooth transitions.

Result: CineLOG, a dataset with 5,000 curated video clips, supports balanced scene descriptions and genre coverage, alongside camera movement annotations; the pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art T2V models.

Conclusion: With CineLOG and its methodology, the paper advances controllable video synthesis, enabling better camera and screenplay control while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Controllable video synthesis is a central challenge in computer vision, yet current models struggle with fine grained control beyond textual prompts, particularly for cinematic attributes like camera trajectory and genre. Existing datasets often suffer from severe data imbalance, noisy labels, or a significant simulation to real gap. To address this, we introduce CineLOG, a new dataset of 5,000 high quality, balanced, and uncut video clips. Each entry is annotated with a detailed scene description, explicit camera instructions based on a standard cinematic taxonomy, and genre label, ensuring balanced coverage across 17 diverse camera movements and 15 film genres. We also present our novel pipeline designed to create this dataset, which decouples the complex text to video (T2V) generation task into four easier stages with more mature technology. To enable coherent, multi shot sequences, we introduce a novel Trajectory Guided Transition Module that generates smooth spatio-temporal interpolation. Extensive human evaluations show that our pipeline significantly outperforms SOTA end to end T2V models in adhering to specific camera and screenplay instructions, while maintaining professional visual quality.

*Rheeya Uppaal,Phu Mon Htut,Min Bai,Nikolaos Pappas,Zheng Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the evaluation of reasoning-augmented vision-language models, introducing a new dimension of assessing visual faithfulness in reasoning chains and proposing methods to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard evaluations for vision-language models, which fail to differentiate between correct answers derived from unfaithful reasoning and faithful reasoning that results in incorrect answers.

Method: The authors propose a training- and reference-free framework that assesses the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains by decomposing these chains into perception and reasoning steps, utilizing off-the-shelf VLM judges for evaluation, and implementing a lightweight self-reflection procedure for correcting unfaithful steps.

Result: The proposed method effectively reduces the Unfaithful Perception Rate in reasoning chains while maintaining final-answer accuracy across multiple reasoning-trained VLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study enhances the reliability of multimodal reasoning by introducing a novel evaluation dimension and tailor-made framework for improving visual faithfulness and transparency in vision-language models.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented vision language models (VLMs) generate explicit chains of thought that promise greater capability and transparency but also introduce new failure modes: models may reach correct answers via visually unfaithful intermediate steps, or reason faithfully yet fail on the final prediction. Standard evaluations that only measure final-answer accuracy cannot distinguish these behaviors. We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation. Building on this metric, we present a lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without any training. Across multiple reasoning-trained VLMs and perception-heavy benchmarks, our method reduces Unfaithful Perception Rate while preserving final-answer accuracy, improving the reliability of multimodal reasoning.

### [176] [Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Learning with Attribute-Centric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12219)
*Zhi Chen,Jingcai Guo,Taotao Cai,Yuxiang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) for zero-shot learning, addressing attribute entanglement by employing specialized mixture-of-experts frameworks for disentangled image representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in recognizing unseen fine-grained categories due to attribute entanglement, where distinct attributes are ambiguously represented in current models.

Method: ACR is implemented with two key components: Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) for conditional dispatch of image patches, and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE) for mapping refined features into disentangled attribute representations.

Result: ACR outperforms previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets including CUB, AwA2, and SUN for zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: By disentangling attributes during representation learning, ACR effectively distinguishes visual differences, advancing fine-grained zero-shot classification.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen fine-grained categories demands a model that can distinguish subtle visual differences. This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts. This ensures coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts. Finally, the MoAE head projects these expert-refined features into sparse, partaware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification. On zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN, our ACR achieves consistent state-of-the-art results.

*Minheng Ni,Zhengyuan Yang,Yaowen Zhang,Linjie Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Zhendong Wang,Xiaofei Wang,Shujie Liu,Lei Zhang,Wangmeng Zuo,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProImage-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation, and finds substantial gaps in existing models' ability to create detailed and specific visuals accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks for generating scientifically precise and specification-faithful illustrations from technical descriptions.

Method: Developed ProImage-Bench with a rubric-based evaluation system for biology schematics, engineering drawings, and scientific diagrams. Used surrounding text and reference figures to create evaluation rubrics and automated evaluation via a large multimodal model-based judge.

Result: Benchmarking shows existing models struggle with fine-grained scientific fidelity, achieving low scores (e.g., 0.553 criterion score at best). Providing targeted feedback to models improves their performance significantly.

Conclusion: ProImage-Bench is a valuable tool for diagnosing shortcomings in professional image generation and provides actionable insights to enhance the generation of specification-faithful scientific visuals.

Abstract: We study professional image generation, where a model must synthesize information-dense, scientifically precise illustrations from technical descriptions rather than merely produce visually plausible pictures. To quantify the progress, we introduce ProImage-Bench, a rubric-based benchmark that targets biology schematics, engineering/patent drawings, and general scientific diagrams. For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations.

### [178] [Comparison of different segmentation algorithms on brain volume and fractal dimension in infant brain MRIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12222)
*Nathalie Alexander,Arnaud Gucciardi,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates infant brain MRI segmentation methods (SynthSeg and SamSeg) for accuracy and their impact on volume and fractal dimension (FD) estimates, finding SynthSeg more reliable but highlighting uncertainties in small morphological changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of segmenting infant brain MRIs, where ongoing myelination and reduced contrast complicate automated segmentation. Accurate segmentation is crucial for understanding developmental changes in brain structure and complexity.

Method: The authors used the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans of infants aged 1-9 months) to compare two segmentation methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, against expert annotations. Metrics like Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information were evaluated, alongside the impact on volumetric and FD analyses.

Result: SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg in segmentation accuracy and volumetric estimations. However, both methods showed limitations with FD variability, which exceeded most developmental group differences. The results also showed improvement in accuracy with age.

Conclusion: While SynthSeg provided better segmentation results, small variations in volume and FD due to segmentation uncertainty imply caution when interpreting these metrics. This highlights the need for further optimization in pediatric MRI analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is essential for quantifying developmental changes in structure and complexity. However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty.

### [179] [Ultra-Low Bitrate Perceptual Image Compression with Shallow Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12229)
*Tianyu Zhang,Dong Liu,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AEIC, a framework using shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate image compression, achieving high perceptual fidelity with efficient encoding and decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressing images at ultra-low bitrates (e.g., <0.05 bits/pixel) is necessary for low-bandwidth, computationally constrained scenarios such as edge devices.

Method: AEIC employs shallow encoders paired with a single-step diffusion decoder. Additionally, a dual-side feature distillation scheme helps transfer knowledge from moderate encoders to shallow variants.

Result: AEIC surpasses existing methods in rate-distortion-perception at ultra-low bitrates while achieving 35.8 FPS encoding speed for 1080P images, with competitive decoding speed.

Conclusion: AEIC achieves simplicity in encoding while maintaining high-quality image reconstructions at extreme bitrates, making it suitable for deployment on constrained devices.

Abstract: Ultra-low bitrate image compression (below 0.05 bits per pixel) is increasingly critical for bandwidth-constrained and computation-limited encoding scenarios such as edge devices. Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods.

### [180] [Moment and Highlight Detection via MLLM Frame Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12246)
*I Putu Andika Bagas Jiwanta,Ayu Purwarianti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach that applies segmentation objectives directly to Multimodal LLM outputs for detecting video moments and highlights using natural-language queries, showing strong results with fewer sampled frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using transformer-based approaches or generative MLLM lack direct gradients for frame-level predictions, especially when using text-based output. This paper aims to address that limitation by improving highlight and moment detection using segmentation objectives.

Method: The method uses segmentation objectives on Multimodal LLM outputs for video highlight and moment retrieval. A fixed number of frames are input to the model along with prompts for generating '0/1' sequences indicating background and foreground probabilities.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving 56.74 HIT@1 on QVHighlights for highlight detection and surpassing baseline moment retrieval methods with 35.28 MAP.

Conclusion: Segmentation losses provide stable learning signals alongside causal LM losses, offering a robust approach to highlight and video moment detection, even with fewer sampled frames.

Abstract: Detecting video moments and highlights from natural-language queries have been unified by transformer-based methods. Other works use generative Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to predict moments and/or highlights as text timestamps, utilizing its reasoning capability. While effective, text-based generation cannot provide direct gradients for frame-level predictions because the model only emits language tokens. Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous "0" and/or "1" characters, with one character per frame. The "0"/"1" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights. Additionally, our efficient method scores above the baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval. Empirically, segmentation losses provide a stable complementary learning signal even when the causal LM loss plateaus.

### [181] [MetaTPT: Meta Test-time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12268)
*Yuqing Lei,Yingjun Du,Yawen Huang,Xiantong Zhen,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaTPT, a meta-learning framework to improve test-time adaptation for vision-language models through dynamic augmentations and prompt tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with domain shifts during testing, and current methods like Test-time Prompt Tuning (TPT) are limited by fixed augmentations. The authors aim to address this limitation with a more adaptive and expressive framework.

Method: The proposed MetaTPT uses a meta-learning framework with dual-loop optimization: the inner loop learns a self-supervised auxiliary task for dynamic augmentations, and the outer loop performs prompt tuning based on consistency across informative views generated by the augmentations.

Result: MetaTPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks by effectively capturing essential features in target domains.

Conclusion: Coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning enhances the test-time adaptation of vision-language models, making them more robust to domain shifts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization but remain sensitive to domain shifts at test time. Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) mitigates this issue by adapting prompts with fixed augmentations, which may falter in more challenging settings. In this work, we propose Meta Test-Time Prompt Tuning (MetaTPT), a meta-learning framework that learns a self-supervised auxiliary task to guide test-time prompt tuning. The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views. By coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning, MetaTPT improves test-time adaptation under domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaTPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks.

*Thibault Geoffroy,Myriam Maumy,Lionel Prevost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid framework that uses deep convolutional features and facial Action Units for continual facial expression recognition, addressing catastrophic forgetting challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI systems that can adapt to human emotions for effective human-computer interaction while overcoming the limitations of forgetting prior knowledge in facial expression recognition.

Method: A hybrid approach combining deep learning and facial Action Units within Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs) for continual emotion recognition without retraining.

Result: The model demonstrated improved accuracy, better knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting when learning and recognizing both basic and compound facial expressions in the CFEE dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems with potential applications in fields like healthcare, education, and adaptive user interfaces.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily life, the ability to recognize and adapt to human emotions is essential for effective human-computer interaction. Facial expression recognition (FER) provides a primary channel for inferring affective states, but the dynamic and culturally nuanced nature of emotions requires models that can learn continuously without forgetting prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The combined representation is modelled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs), which provide a lightweight, probabilistic solution that avoids retraining while offering strong discriminative power. Using the Compound Facial Expression of Emotion (CFEE) dataset, we show that our model can first learn basic expressions and then progressively recognize compound expressions. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, stronger knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting. This framework contributes to the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems with applications in education, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

*Jiahao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cognitive-YOLO, an LLM-driven framework that directly synthesizes object detection architectures from dataset features, outperforming baseline models in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual design of object detection architectures is time-consuming, NAS is computationally intensive, and current LLM-based methods lack holistic understanding when generating architectures.

Method: The framework extracts dataset meta-features, uses an LLM combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for reasoning, and synthesizes architecture using Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL), which a compiler translates into deployable models.

Result: Cognitive-YOLO shows superior performance and a better performance-per-parameter balance on five datasets compared to strong baseline models.

Conclusion: Data-driven reasoning by LLMs, based on dataset characteristics, is key for achieving better architectures, with first principle understanding being more crucial than merely retrieving SOTA components.

Abstract: Designing high-performance object detection architectures is a complex task, where traditional manual design is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is computationally prohibitive. While recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often function as iterative optimizers within a search loop, rather than generating architectures directly from a holistic understanding of the data. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks. Crucially, our ablation studies prove that the LLM's data-driven reasoning is the primary driver of performance, demonstrating that a deep understanding of data "first principles" is more critical for achieving a superior architecture than simply retrieving SOTA components.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in evaluating drag-based image editing models by introducing a comprehensive benchmark called RealDrag, along with novel metrics and systematic analysis of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks, metrics, and ground truth datasets makes comparing drag-based image editing models unreliable and hampers progress in the field.

Method: The paper introduces RealDrag, a dataset containing over 400 annotated samples, paired ground truth images, editable regions, handle-target points, and captions. Additionally, it proposes four evaluation metrics to improve assessment fidelity.

Result: Their systematic analysis of 17 state-of-the-art models revealed trade-offs among approaches, providing insights into strengths and weaknesses while establishing a baseline for further comparison.

Conclusion: RealDrag represents a significant step toward improving the reliability and reproducibility of evaluation in drag-based image editing. The publicly available dataset and tools will advance the field.

Abstract: The evaluation of drag based image editing models is unreliable due to a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics. This ambiguity stems from inconsistent evaluation protocols and, critically, the absence of datasets containing ground truth target images, making objective comparisons between competing methods difficult. To address this, we introduce \textbf{RealDrag}, the first comprehensive benchmark for point based image editing that includes paired ground truth target images. Our dataset contains over 400 human annotated samples from diverse video sources, providing source/target images, handle/target points, editable region masks, and descriptive captions for both the image and the editing action.
  We also propose four novel, task specific metrics: Semantical Distance (SeD), Outer Mask Preserving Score (OMPS), Inner Patch Preserving Score (IPPS), and Directional Similarity (DiS). These metrics are designed to quantify pixel level matching fidelity, check preservation of non edited (out of mask) regions, and measure semantic alignment with the desired task. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large scale systematic analysis of the field, evaluating 17 SOTA models. Our results reveal clear trade offs among current approaches and establish a robust, reproducible baseline to guide future research. Our dataset and evaluation toolkit will be made publicly available.

*Hyunju Lee,Youngmin Oh,Jeimin Jeon,Donghyeon Baek,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer architecture search methods aim to discover efficient transformers by automating their design. The proposed approach, GrowTAS, progressively trains subnets from small to large, reducing interference and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TAS methods suffer from weight interference among subnets, causing performance degradation, especially in smaller architectures. This paper aims to alleviate this issue by leveraging well-trained smaller subnets as a foundation for training larger ones.

Method: The proposed GrowTAS framework progressively trains subnets, starting with smaller architectures and gradually incorporating larger ones to reduce interference. GrowTAS+ extends this approach by fine-tuning specific weights to optimize performance further.

Result: Experimental results on ImageNet and transfer learning datasets (CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, Cars, INAT-19) show that GrowTAS outperforms existing TAS methods in terms of architecture efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The progressive training strategy of GrowTAS effectively enhances the transformer architecture search process and improves model performance, making it a promising alternative to traditional TAS methods.

Abstract: Transformer architecture search (TAS) aims to automatically discover efficient vision transformers (ViTs), reducing the need for manual design. Existing TAS methods typically train an over-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) that encompasses all candidate architectures (i.e., subnets). However, all subnets share the same set of weights, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and several transfer learning benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, CARS, and INAT-19, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over current TAS methods

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Intention-Drive, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems on their ability to fulfill high-level human intentions, a capability current models lack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving systems lack the capability to go beyond executing basic commands to understanding and executing high-level human intentions.

Method: The authors introduce Intention-Drive, featuring a dataset of complex driving scenarios with associated natural language intentions, and propose the Intent Success Rate (ISR) metric to evaluate goal accomplishment.

Result: Baseline models evaluated on Intention-Drive show limited performance, revealing a deficit in understanding and fulfilling high-level human intentions in complex scenes.

Conclusion: Intention-Drive serves as a crucial benchmark to address limitations in current systems and highlights the need for advancements in understanding human intentions for intelligent autonomous driving.

Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems operate at a level of intelligence akin to following simple steering commands. However, achieving genuinely intelligent autonomy requires a paradigm shift: moving from merely executing low-level instructions to understanding and fulfilling high-level, abstract human intentions. This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task.

*Yang Ou,Xiongwei Zhao,Xinye Yang,Yihan Wang,Yicheng Di,Rong Yuan,Xieyuanli Chen,Xu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMUDA framework introduces three masking strategies to improve unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation, achieving significant improvement on SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, and GTA5 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UDA methods for semantic segmentation struggle with domain gaps caused by contextual ambiguity, unstable feature representations, and pseudo-label noise, motivating the need for hierarchical solutions.

Method: OMUDA employs three strategies: Context-Aware Masking (to balance context and detail), Feature Distillation Masking (to transfer robust feature learning), and Class Decoupling Masking (to address pseudo-label noise).

Result: OMUDA achieved state-of-the-art performance on UDA benchmarks (SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes), providing an average 7% improvement and seamless integration into existing methods.

Conclusion: OMUDA’s hierarchical masking strategies effectively address domain gaps at multiple levels, offering a unified framework for advancing UDA capabilities in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables semantic segmentation models to generalize from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%.

*Benjamin Beilharz,Thomas S. A. Wallis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MRD, a differentiable rendering-based method aimed at understanding vision models' implicit 3D scene representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in understanding and explaining vision models' internal representations and decisions, particularly their implicit understanding of 3D scene properties.

Method: MRD uses physically based differentiable rendering to analyze model responses by optimizing 3D scenes with different physical parameters that yield the same model activations.

Result: The study found high similarity in model activation between target and optimized 3D scenes. This approach qualitatively reveals physical scene attributes influencing model sensitivity or invariance.

Conclusion: MRD provides a novel framework for probing vision models' 3D understanding, advancing insights into both human and computer vision systems through analysis of physical scene parameters.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.

### [189] [WeDetect: Fast Open-Vocabulary Object Detection as Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12309)
*Shenghao Fu,Yukun Su,Fengyun Rao,Jing Lyu,Xiaohua Xie,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeDetect is a model family for open-vocabulary object detection that unifies detection, proposal generation, object retrieval, and referring expression comprehension (REC) under a more efficient retrieval framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inference efficiency and versatility of open-vocabulary object detection models by eliminating the need for cross-modal fusion layers and fully embracing a retrieval-based design.

Method: WeDetect employs a dual-tower architecture for real-time detection and adapts a retrieval-based framework, using proposal embeddings that enable various tasks such as object detection, object retrieval, and REC. It includes sub-models WeDetect-Uni (proposal generator) and WeDetect-Ref (LMM-based classifier).

Result: WeDetect achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary object detection with high inference efficiency, demonstrated across 15 benchmarks. It also enables applications like class-specific object retrieval and efficient REC.

Conclusion: WeDetect redefines open-vocabulary object detection as a retrieval problem, resulting in a unified, efficient, and high-performing approach for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection aims to detect arbitrary classes via text prompts. Methods without cross-modal fusion layers (non-fusion) offer faster inference by treating recognition as a retrieval problem, \ie, matching regions to text queries in a shared embedding space. In this work, we fully explore this retrieval philosophy and demonstrate its unique advantages in efficiency and versatility through a model family named WeDetect: (1) State-of-the-art performance. WeDetect is a real-time detector with a dual-tower architecture. We show that, with well-curated data and full training, the non-fusion WeDetect surpasses other fusion models and establishes a strong open-vocabulary foundation. (2) Fast backtrack of historical data. WeDetect-Uni is a universal proposal generator based on WeDetect. We freeze the entire detector and only finetune an objectness prompt to retrieve generic object proposals across categories. Importantly, the proposal embeddings are class-specific and enable a new application, object retrieval, supporting retrieval objects in historical data. (3) Integration with LMMs for referring expression comprehension (REC). We further propose WeDetect-Ref, an LMM-based object classifier to handle complex referring expressions, which retrieves target objects from the proposal list extracted by WeDetect-Uni. It discards next-token prediction and classifies objects in a single forward pass. Together, the WeDetect family unifies detection, proposal generation, object retrieval, and REC under a coherent retrieval framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 benchmarks with high inference efficiency.

*Maurya Goyal,Anuj Singh,Hadi Jamali-Rad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCoDe is a proposed algorithm that combines sampling-based and gradient-guided methods to align diffusion model outputs efficiently with downstream objectives, achieving competitive task-specific performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve task-specific performance of diffusion models by overcoming sampling inefficiencies and balancing reward alignment and divergence from unconditional priorities.

Method: UniCoDe integrates sampling-based and gradient-guided guidance strategies into a unified framework, leveraging local gradient signals during sampling.

Result: UniCoDe outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across a range of tasks.

Conclusion: The approach bridges two paradigms for alignment in diffusion models, achieving efficient sampling and improved trade-offs for downstream objectives. Code is publicly available for use.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion model outputs with downstream objectives is essential for improving task-specific performance. Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior. Empirical results demonstrate that UniCoDe remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across a range of tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/maurya-goyal10/UniCoDe

TL;DR: The study introduces Daylily-Leaf, a lesion-level dataset, and TCLeaf-Net, a hybrid detector for plant disease detection, showcasing effectiveness and efficiency in real-field scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting plant foliar diseases due to cluttered backgrounds, domain shifts, and lack of lesion-level data in real-world conditions.

Method: Daylily-Leaf dataset was released, combined with TCLeaf-Net, a transformer-convolution hybrid detector. It includes modules like TCM for background suppression, RSFRS for detail preservation, and DFPN for multi-scale lesion detection.

Result: The TCLeaf-Net model achieved a 5.4% improvement in mAP@50 on the Daylily-Leaf dataset, reduced computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU usage by 8.7%, and outperformed YOLO and RT-DETR models across datasets.

Conclusion: TCLeaf-Net coupled with the Daylily-Leaf dataset demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and generalizability in detecting foliar diseases, offering a promising solution for real-world agricultural applications.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of foliar diseases is vital for safeguarding crop growth and reducing yield losses. Yet, in real-field conditions, cluttered backgrounds, domain shifts, and limited lesion-level datasets hinder robust modeling. To address these challenges, we release Daylily-Leaf, a paired lesion-level dataset comprising 1,746 RGB images and 7,839 lesions captured under both ideal and in-field conditions, and propose TCLeaf-Net, a transformer-convolution hybrid detector optimized for real-field use. TCLeaf-Net is designed to tackle three major challenges. To mitigate interference from complex backgrounds, the transformer-convolution module (TCM) couples global context with locality-preserving convolution to suppress non-leaf regions. To reduce information loss during downsampling, the raw-scale feature recalling and sampling (RSFRS) block combines bilinear resampling and convolution to preserve fine spatial detail. To handle variations in lesion scale and feature shifts, the deformable alignment block with FPN (DFPN) employs offset-based alignment and multi-receptive-field perception to strengthen multi-scale fusion. Experimental results show that on the in-field split of the Daylily-Leaf dataset, TCLeaf-Net improves mAP@50 by 5.4 percentage points over the baseline model, reaching 78.2\%, while reducing computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU memory usage by 8.7\%. Moreover, the model outperforms recent YOLO and RT-DETR series in both precision and recall, and demonstrates strong performance on the PlantDoc, Tomato-Leaf, and Rice-Leaf datasets, validating its robustness and generalizability to other plant disease detection scenarios.

*Yufei Yin,Qianke Meng,Minghao Chen,Jiajun Ding,Zhenwei Shao,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoARM is a novel framework for understanding long-form videos through adaptive, agentic reasoning and hierarchical memory, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for long-form video understanding rely on handcrafted pipelines or token-intensive preprocessing, which limits their efficiency and adaptability.

Method: VideoARM utilizes an agentic reasoning loop (observe, think, act, memorize) alongside a hierarchical multimodal memory to process videos adaptively and efficiently.

Result: VideoARM demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form video tasks.

Conclusion: VideoARM offers a robust, adaptive solution for long-form video understanding, reducing dependency on exhaustive preprocessing and enabling efficient analysis.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging due to the extended temporal structure and dense multimodal cues. Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.

*Peixuan Zhang,Zijian Jia,Kaiqi Liu,Shuchen Weng,Si Li,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAGE, a novel approach for multi-shot video generation using structural storyboards and unique methodologies for coherence and cinematic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in generative models have enhanced video synthesis, but maintaining narrative, cross-shot consistency, and cinematic language remains challenging.

Method: The paper proposes STAGE, emphasizing structural storyboards, multi-shot memory pack, dual-encoding strategy, and two-stage training. It also introduces the ConStoryBoard dataset for enhanced annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments showcase STAGE's ability to achieve superior narrative control and cross-shot consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: STAGE offers a promising workflow for multi-shot video generation, addressing limitations in coherence and cinematic transitions while leveraging structured narrative elements.

Abstract: While recent advancements in generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity in video synthesis, creating coherent multi-shot narratives remains a significant challenge. To address this, keyframe-based approaches have emerged as a promising alternative to computationally intensive end-to-end methods, offering the advantages of fine-grained control and greater efficiency. However, these methods often fail to maintain cross-shot consistency and capture cinematic language. In this paper, we introduce STAGE, a SToryboard-Anchored GEneration workflow to reformulate the keyframe-based multi-shot video generation task. Instead of using sparse keyframes, we propose STEP2 to predict a structural storyboard composed of start-end frame pairs for each shot. We introduce the multi-shot memory pack to ensure long-range entity consistency, the dual-encoding strategy for intra-shot coherence, and the two-stage training scheme to learn cinematic inter-shot transition. We also contribute the large-scale ConStoryBoard dataset, including high-quality movie clips with fine-grained annotations for story progression, cinematic attributes, and human preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAGE achieves superior performance in structured narrative control and cross-shot coherence.

*Hyunkoo Lee,Wooseok Jang,Jini Yang,Taehwan Kim,Sangoh Kim,Sangwon Jung,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Warper introduces a training-free framework for video personalization using transformer-based video diffusion models, improving appearance fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in video personalization like computational cost, scalability, and fine-grained appearance consistency.

Method: Uses a two-step integration: (1) Coarse appearance adaptation via image-based LoRA/subject-embedding adaptation; (2) Fine appearance refinement at inference using semantic correspondences and feature warping.

Result: Enhances appearance fidelity, maintains prompt alignment and motion dynamics, and eliminates the need for large-scale video finetuning.

Conclusion: V-Warper efficiently improves video personalization with substantial fidelity and scalability advantages.

Abstract: Video personalization aims to generate videos that faithfully reflect a user-provided subject while following a text prompt. However, existing approaches often rely on heavy video-based finetuning or large-scale video datasets, which impose substantial computational cost and are difficult to scale. Furthermore, they still struggle to maintain fine-grained appearance consistency across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce V-Warper, a training-free coarse-to-fine personalization framework for transformer-based video diffusion models. The framework enhances fine-grained identity fidelity without requiring any additional video training. (1) A lightweight coarse appearance adaptation stage leverages only a small set of reference images, which are already required for the task. This step encodes global subject identity through image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation. (2) A inference-time fine appearance injection stage refines visual fidelity by computing semantic correspondences from RoPE-free mid-layer query--key features. These correspondences guide the warping of appearance-rich value representations into semantically aligned regions of the generation process, with masking ensuring spatial reliability. V-Warper significantly improves appearance fidelity while preserving prompt alignment and motion dynamics, and it achieves these gains efficiently without large-scale video finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing HMR datasets with better data quality and multimodal inputs to address limitations of existing approaches in occlusion, lighting, and privacy constraints.

Method: Creating the M4Human dataset combining high-resolution mmWave radar, RGB, and depth sensors, offering both raw and processed radar data, and annotating with 3D meshes and motion capture information for diverse human actions.

Result: The M4Human benchmarks on radar and multimodal data demonstrate its utility for radar-based human modeling along with its limitations in handling rapid motion.

Conclusion: M4Human is a significant contribution to the HMR field, enabling extensive research possibilities while highlighting challenges in fast and free motion scenarios. Dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Human mesh reconstruction (HMR) provides direct insights into body-environment interaction, which enables various immersive applications. While existing large-scale HMR datasets rely heavily on line-of-sight RGB input, vision-based sensing is limited by occlusion, lighting variation, and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, recent efforts have explored radio-frequency (RF) mmWave radar for privacy-preserving indoor human sensing. However, current radar datasets are constrained by sparse skeleton labels, limited scale, and simple in-place actions. To advance the HMR research community, we introduce M4Human, the current largest-scale (661K-frame) ($9\times$ prior largest) multimodal benchmark, featuring high-resolution mmWave radar, RGB, and depth data. M4Human provides both raw radar tensors (RT) and processed radar point clouds (RPC) to enable research across different levels of RF signal granularity. M4Human includes high-quality motion capture (MoCap) annotations with 3D meshes and global trajectories, and spans 20 subjects and 50 diverse actions, including in-place, sit-in-place, and free-space sports or rehabilitation movements. We establish benchmarks on both RT and RPC modalities, as well as multimodal fusion with RGB-D modalities. Extensive results highlight the significance of M4Human for radar-based human modeling while revealing persistent challenges under fast, unconstrained motion. The dataset and code will be released after the paper publication.

Result: The approach achieves FID 3.49 and KDD 0.319 on ImageNet-256 with a 140M parameter model trained in 400K iterations. The results are comparable to much larger models trained for longer durations.

Conclusion: SR-DiT is a computationally efficient framework that systematically combines multiple techniques, serving as an accessible baseline for future diffusion transformer research.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved the training efficiency of diffusion transformers. However, these techniques have largely been studied in isolation, leaving unexplored the potential synergies from combining multiple approaches. We present SR-DiT (Speedrun Diffusion Transformer), a framework that systematically integrates token routing, architectural improvements, and training modifications on top of representation alignment. Our approach achieves FID 3.49 and KDD 0.319 on ImageNet-256 using only a 140M parameter model at 400K iterations without classifier-free guidance - comparable to results from 685M parameter models trained significantly longer. To our knowledge, this is a state-of the-art result at this model size. Through extensive ablation studies, we identify which technique combinations are most effective and document both synergies and incompatibilities. We release our framework as a computationally accessible baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtGen is a conditional diffusion-based framework generating realistic articulated 3D objects with coherent geometry and kinematics from single-view images or text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with ambiguity in kinematic structures and entanglement between geometry and joint dynamics due to reliance on single-view input.

Method: ArtGen introduces cross-state Monte Carlo sampling for global kinematic consistency, a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module for structural priors, and a compositional 3D-VAE latent prior with local-global attention for detailed geometry and relationships.

Result: Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark show ArtGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic articulated structures.

Conclusion: ArtGen effectively resolves structural-motion entanglement, enabling accurate generation of articulated 3D objects with practical applications in robotics and embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Generating articulated assets is crucial for robotics, digital twins, and embodied intelligence. Existing generative models often rely on single-view inputs representing closed states, resulting in ambiguous or unrealistic kinematic structures due to the entanglement between geometric shape and joint dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtGen, a conditional diffusion-based framework capable of generating articulated 3D objects with accurate geometry and coherent kinematics from single-view images or text descriptions at arbitrary part-level states. Specifically, ArtGen employs cross-state Monte Carlo sampling to explicitly enforce global kinematic consistency, reducing structural-motion entanglement. Additionally, we integrate a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module to infer robust structural priors, such as part semantics, joint types, and connectivity, guiding a sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer to specialize in diverse kinematic interactions. Furthermore, a compositional 3D-VAE latent prior enhanced with local-global attention effectively captures fine-grained geometry and global part-level relationships. Extensive experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that ArtGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Khalfalla Awedat,Mohamed Abidalrekab,Mohammad El-Yabroudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vertical beam dropout in LiDAR sensors by introducing a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing data points solely from the current LiDAR frame, achieving high accuracy in reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical beam dropouts in spinning LiDAR sensors, caused by factors such as hardware aging, environmental conditions, or bright reflections, severely affect 3D perception in autonomous vehicles, necessitating a solution for data recovery.

Method: The method uses a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model each LiDAR sweep as an unstructured spatial graph. Nodes are represented by points, edges connect nearby points, and the GAT learns attention weights to reconstruct missing vertical channels by regressing elevation values.

Result: On the KITTI dataset with simulated channel dropout, the proposed approach achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points within a 10 cm error threshold. The inference requires 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a pure graph-based model can effectively recover missing vertical beams in LiDAR data, maintaining performance under varying neighborhood sizes and proving robust despite realistic sensor degradations.

Abstract: Vertical beam dropout in spinning LiDAR sensors triggered by hardware aging, dust, snow, fog, or bright reflections removes entire vertical slices from the point cloud and severely degrades 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k. These results show that a pure graph attention model operating solely on raw point-cloud geometry can effectively recover dropped vertical beams under realistic sensor degradation.

TL;DR: ViInfographicVQA introduces the first Vietnamese Visual Question Answering benchmark for data-rich infographics, with single and multi-image reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a Vietnamese benchmark for infographics that involve complex visual and textual reasoning, and to evaluate the efficiency of current models in such scenarios.

Method: Developed a benchmark dataset with 6747 infographics and 20409 question-answer pairs in Vietnamese, involving single-image and multi-image tasks. Evaluated existing vision-language models on this dataset.

Result: The evaluation revealed substantial performance gaps, especially in multi-image tasks involving cross-image integration and reasoning.

Conclusion: ViInfographicVQA highlights the limitations of current multimodal models in reasoning for infographic-rich and low-resource contexts, aiming to inspire further research on better cross-image reasoning methods.

Abstract: Infographic Visual Question Answering (InfographicVQA) evaluates a model's ability to read and reason over data-rich, layout-heavy visuals that combine text, charts, icons, and design elements. Compared with scene-text or natural-image VQA, infographics require stronger integration of OCR, layout understanding, and numerical and semantic reasoning. We introduce ViInfographicVQA, the first benchmark for Vietnamese InfographicVQA, comprising over 6747 real-world infographics and 20409 human-verified question-answer pairs across economics, healthcare, education, and more. The benchmark includes two evaluation settings. The Single-image task follows the traditional setup in which each question is answered using a single infographic. The Multi-image task requires synthesizing evidence across multiple semantically related infographics and is, to our knowledge, the first Vietnamese evaluation of cross-image reasoning in VQA. We evaluate a range of recent vision-language models on this benchmark, revealing substantial performance disparities, with the most significant errors occurring on Multi-image questions that involve cross-image integration and non-span reasoning. ViInfographicVQA contributes benchmark results for Vietnamese InfographicVQA and sheds light on the limitations of current multimodal models in low-resource contexts, encouraging future exploration of layout-aware and cross-image reasoning methods.

*Hangwei Zhang,Armando Teles Fortes,Tianyi Wei,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BokehDepth, a two-stage framework to improve bokeh rendering and monocular depth estimation by leveraging defocus cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linkage between bokeh and depth estimation is underutilized, despite the shared lens imaging geometry. Existing methods either amplify artifacts due to noisy depth data in bokeh rendering or fail in regions where defocus cues are critical for depth estimation, leading to a need for a more robust approach.

Method: The proposed framework entails two stages: Stage-1 generates depth-free bokeh stacks using a physically guided bokeh generator; Stage-2 integrates a lightweight defocus-aware module into monocular depth encoders to fuse defocus-related features effectively.

Result: The method demonstrates improved visual quality in bokeh rendering and enhances metric accuracy and robustness of existing monocular depth estimation models across challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the synergistic relationship between bokeh synthesis and depth estimation, presenting practical improvements with robust performance in both domains.

Abstract: Bokeh and monocular depth estimation are tightly coupled through the same lens imaging geometry, yet current methods exploit this connection in incomplete ways. High-quality bokeh rendering pipelines typically depend on noisy depth maps, which amplify estimation errors into visible artifacts, while modern monocular metric depth models still struggle on weakly textured, distant and geometrically ambiguous regions where defocus cues are most informative. We introduce BokehDepth, a two-stage framework that decouples bokeh synthesis from depth prediction and treats defocus as an auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue. In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the D3D-VLP model to address interpretability and interdependencies in embodied agents by combining a 3D Chain-of-Thought and synergistic learning across hybrid datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of interpretability and explicit 3D reasoning in end-to-end models, coupled with modular systems ignoring cross-component synergies, motivated the need for a unified model to handle these challenges for embodied agents.

Method: The D3D-VLP model introduces (1) Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought for unified reasoning and planning, and (2) Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision to leverage hybrid partially-annotated data using a masked autoregressive loss.

Result: D3D-VLP outperformed existing models in Vision-and-Language Navigation (R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE, NavRAG-CE), Object-goal Navigation (HM3D-OVON), and Sequential Grounding benchmarks, and proved its efficiency in real-world mobile experiments.

Conclusion: By incorporating 3D reasoning and leveraging fragmented supervision, the D3D-VLP model demonstrates significant improvements in embodied agent tasks, showcasing the capability for unified and interpretable reasoning.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a critical dilemma that end-to-end models lack interpretability and explicit 3D reasoning, while modular systems ignore cross-component interdependencies and synergies. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model (D3D-VLP). Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data. This allows different CoT components to mutually reinforce and implicitly supervise each other. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset with 10M hybrid samples from 5K real scans and 20K synthetic scenes that are compatible with online learning methods such as RL and DAgger. Our D3D-VLP achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including Vision-and-Language Navigation (R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE, NavRAG-CE), Object-goal Navigation (HM3D-OVON), and Task-oriented Sequential Grounding and Navigation (SG3D). Real-world mobile manipulation experiments further validate the effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), which is a learnable representation for efficient multi-view photon mapping, significantly reducing computation time while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency in traditional photon mapping methods, particularly the need for redundant photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation per viewpoint, motivates the development of a more computationally efficient approach for multi-view rendering.

Method: The proposed method, Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), encodes photons as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives and optimizes this representation using multi-view radiance supervision, allowing for continuous radiance evaluations without repetitive photon tracing.

Result: GPF offers photon-level accuracy in global illumination modeling while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, even in scenes with complex light transport effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions.

Conclusion: The study successfully combines the physical accuracy of photon mapping with the computational efficiency of neural scene representations, enabling faster and more efficient multi-view rendering.

Abstract: Accurately modeling light transport is essential for realistic image synthesis. Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations.

Method: PeRL-VL uses a VLM-based reward for training perception and a reasoning-specific fine-tuning stage (SFT) with chain-of-thought data to independently improve reasoning and perception.

Result: PeRL-VL demonstrated significant performance improvements, increasing Pass@1 accuracy from 63.3% to 68.8% across multimodal benchmarks, surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled framework effectively enhances both perception and reasoning, addressing persistent VLM issues and achieving better multimodal reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently been extended from text-only LLMs to vision-language models (VLMs) to elicit long-chain multimodal reasoning. However, RLVR-trained VLMs still exhibit two persistent failure modes: inaccurate visual extraction (missing or hallucinating details) and logically inconsistent chains-of-thought, largely because verifiable signals supervise only the final answer. We propose PeRL-VL (Perception and Reasoning Learning for Vision-Language Models), a decoupled framework that separately improves visual perception and textual reasoning on top of RLVR. For perception, PeRL-VL introduces a VLM-based description reward that scores the model's self-generated image descriptions for faithfulness and sufficiency. For reasoning, PeRL-VL adds a text-only Reasoning SFT stage on logic-rich chain-of-thought data, enhancing coherence and logical consistency independently of vision. Across diverse multimodal benchmarks, PeRL-VL improves average Pass@1 accuracy from 63.3% (base Qwen2.5-VL-7B) to 68.8%, outperforming standard RLVR, text-only reasoning SFT, and naive multimodal distillation from GPT-4o.

### [205] [Cross-Level Sensor Fusion with Object Lists via Transformer for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12884)
*Xiangzhong Liu,Jiajie Zhang,Hao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative cross-level fusion approach using Transformer for 3D object detection by integrating raw camera images with abstract object lists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensor fusion systems process sensor data at different levels, limiting integration efficiency. The authors aim to propose an end-to-end solution bridging abstract object lists and raw sensor data leveraging Transformer models.

Method: The authors use a Transformer model where object lists act as denoising queries, combined with learnable queries during feature aggregation. A deformable Gaussian mask guides attention to target areas and aids faster model training. Additionally, pseudo object lists are generated from dataset ground-truth bounding boxes for testing the approach.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms vision-based baselines on the nuScenes dataset, showing robustness and generalization capabilities across noise levels and real-world detector outputs.

Conclusion: The cross-level fusion concept enhances sensor fusion efficiency, creating a notable performance improvement framework for automotive 3D object detection systems.

Abstract: In automotive sensor fusion systems, smart sensors and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) modules are commonly utilized. Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.

*Shengkai Xu,Hsiang Lun Kao,Tianxiang Xu,Honghui Zhang,Junqiao Wang,Runmeng Ding,Guanyu Liu,Tianyu Shi,Zhenyu Yu,Guofeng Pan,Ziqian Bi,Yuqi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polyp detection in real-world endoscopy faces challenges due to degraded image quality. AdaptiveDetector, combining YOLOv11 and a vision-language verifier, improves recall and reduces false negatives in adverse imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current polyp detectors perform poorly in real-world scenarios due to image degradation and a domain gap between laboratory and clinical settings.

Method: A two-stage framework: YOLOv11 for detection, and a vision-language model verifier, tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization and an asymmetric reward function to minimize missed detections.

Result: Improved recall (14-22%) on degraded endoscopy images and comparable precision to YOLO alone, demonstrating superior performance under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances polyp detection in clinically challenging scenarios, reducing missed detections and potentially improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Polyp detectors trained on clean datasets often underperform in real-world endoscopy, where illumination changes, motion blur, and occlusions degrade image quality. Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between controlled laboratory conditions and clinical practice, where adverse imaging conditions are prevalent. In this work, we propose AdaptiveDetector, a novel two-stage detector-verifier framework comprising a YOLOv11 detector with a vision-language model (VLM) verifier. The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement. To enable realistic assessment under challenging conditions, we construct a comprehensive synthetic testbed by systematically degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice, providing a rigorous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation. Extensive zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images demonstrates that our approach improves recall by 14 to 22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above the baseline. This combination of adaptive thresholding and cost-sensitive reinforcement learning achieves clinically aligned, open-world polyp detection with substantially fewer false negatives, thereby reducing the risk of missed precancerous polyps and improving patient outcomes.

*Minghao Zhu,Zhihao Zhang,Anmol Sidhu,Keith Redmill*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a zero-shot road sign recognition framework using RAG, combining Vision Language and Large Language Models, achieving high accuracy without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty traditional deep learning methods face in recognizing diverse road sign classes without requiring exhaustive labeled datasets.

Method: The method uses Vision Language Models to describe road signs, retrieves relevant candidates from a database, and employs Large Language Models for fine-grained recognition.

Result: The framework achieves 95.58% accuracy on reference images and 82.45% on real-world data, indicating high effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study proves the RAG-based architecture can scale road sign recognition without the need for task-specific training.

Abstract: Automated road sign recognition is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems, but traditional deep learning methods struggle with the sheer number of sign classes and the impracticality of creating exhaustive labeled datasets. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training.

### [208] [Advancing Cache-Based Few-Shot Classification via Patch-Driven Relational Gated Graph Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12498)
*Tasweer Ahmad,Arindam Sikdar,Sandip Pradhan,Ardhendu Behera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a patch-driven relational refinement approach to improve few-shot image classification under domain shift using cache-based adaptations, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines without adding inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of few-shot image classification, especially under visual domain shift, where existing methods fail to optimally adapt global representations to domain-specific tasks.

Method: The method introduces a relational gated graph attention network to refine image features by constructing patch graphs, performing edge-aware attention, and using multi-aggregation pooling to create task-discriminative representations. The relational structure is distilled into cache adapters during training, preserving inference efficiency.

Result: Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods in few-shot classification, along with practical validation on a newly introduced Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for UAV-driven search-and-rescue.

Conclusion: This approach significantly enhances few-shot classification under domain shift by refining patch-level relations, aligning cache key embeddings with target classes, and maintaining zero-shot inference efficiency, proving battlefield application potential.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains difficult under limited supervision and visual domain shift. Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the "platinum minutes" and the broader "golden hour" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Motus, a unified latent action world model, leveraging pretrained models for multimodal generative capabilities and improving robotic task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models are overly fragmented, limiting the ability to unify multimodal generative capabilities and learn from diverse data.

Method: Motus employs a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture and UniDiffuser-style scheduler for flexible modeling and integrates latent action learning with optical flow and a detailed action training pipeline.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in both simulation (+15% vs. X-VLA; +45% vs. Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios (+11–48%) for robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Motus achieves unified modeling capabilities that enhance multimodal generative tasks and downstream robotic task performance.

Abstract: While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.

*Jinfan Zhou,Lixin Luo,Sungmin Eum,Heesung Kwon,Jeong Joon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to spatiotemporal data augmentation using video diffusion models for realistic scene diversity, improving performance in data-scarce situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in low-data training scenarios, such as UAV imagery, by increasing diversity in spatial and temporal axes of datasets.

Method: Utilizing off-the-shelf video diffusion models for generating synthetic video clips, paired with guidelines for annotation transfer and addressing disocclusion.

Result: Consistent performance improvements shown on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets through diversified training data.

Conclusion: Spatiotemporal augmentation effectively enhances dataset distribution and model performance in sparse data settings through generative techniques.

Abstract: We explore spatiotemporal data augmentation using video foundation models to diversify both camera viewpoints and scene dynamics. Unlike existing approaches based on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, our method leverages off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations from a given image dataset. Incorporating these synthesized video clips as supplemental training data yields consistent performance gains in low-data settings, such as UAV-captured imagery where annotations are scarce. Beyond empirical improvements, we provide practical guidelines for (i) choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal generative setup, (ii) transferring annotations to synthetic frames, and (iii) addressing disocclusion - regions newly revealed and unlabeled in generated views. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets show that, when applied judiciously, spatiotemporal augmentation broadens the data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional and prior generative methods, offering an effective lever for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: MMDrive is a novel multimodal vision-language model designed to improve 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving by integrating occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve autonomous driving performance by addressing limitations in existing vision-language models that only perceive 2D information, restricting deep semantic fusion and 3D spatial understanding.

Method: MMDrive introduces Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator for adaptive cross-modal fusion and Cross-Modal Abstractor for compact semantic extraction, integrating multimodal data including 3D spatial and textual inputs.

Result: MMDrive achieves notable improvements with BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMDrive overcomes the traditional limitations of image-only models, enabling robust multimodal reasoning and interpretable 3D scene understanding, which is crucial for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Animus3D is a framework for creating 3D animations from static models and text prompts, introducing a novel Motion Score Distillation (MSD) method for better motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques create limited or jittery 3D animations from text prompts due to their reliance on vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS).

Method: Animus3D proposes Motion Score Distillation (MSD) with a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model, inversion-based noise estimation, and temporal-spatial regularization, alongside a motion refinement module for resolution enhancement.

Result: The framework produces animations with more substantial motion and fine details while preserving visual integrity, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Animus3D effectively addresses the limitations of prior methods, making it a robust tool for text-driven 3D animation creation.

Abstract: We present Animus3D, a text-driven 3D animation framework that generates motion field given a static 3D asset and text prompt. Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity. Code will be released at https://qiisun.github.io/animus3d_page.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new coronary artery segmentation framework using myocardial anatomical priors, wavelet transformations, and multi-scale modeling, achieving better segmentation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries is crucial for quantitative coronary analysis and clinical decisions, but conventional methods struggle with small vessel calibers, blurred boundaries, and geometric complexities.

Method: The framework integrates myocardial anatomical priors, residual attention-based feature enhancement, 3D wavelet/inverse wavelet transformations, and multi-scale feature fusion with a patch-based training strategy.

Result: The model achieved high segmentation performance on the ImageCAS dataset, with a Dice coefficient of 0.8082, Sensitivity of 0.7946, Precision of 0.8471, and HD95 of 9.77 mm.

Conclusion: The method provides reliable coronary artery segmentation under complex conditions, improving stability and structural representation for further coronary analysis tasks.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation from coronary computed tomography angiography is essential for quantitative coronary analysis and clinical decision support. Nevertheless, reliable segmentation remains challenging because of small vessel calibers, complex branching, blurred boundaries, and myocardial interference. We propose a coronary artery segmentation framework that integrates myocardial anatomical priors, structure aware feature encoding, and three dimensional wavelet inverse wavelet transformations. Myocardial priors and residual attention based feature enhancement are incorporated during encoding to strengthen coronary structure representation. Wavelet inverse wavelet based downsampling and upsampling enable joint spatial frequency modeling and preserve multi scale structural consistency, while a multi scale feature fusion module integrates semantic and geometric information in the decoding stage. The model is trained and evaluated on the public ImageCAS dataset using a 3D overlapping patch based strategy with a 7:1:2 split for training, validation, and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.8082, Sensitivity of 0.7946, Precision of 0.8471, and an HD95 of 9.77 mm, outperforming several mainstream segmentation models. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of individual components. The proposed method enables more stable and consistent coronary artery segmentation under complex geometric conditions, providing reliable segmentation results for subsequent coronary structure analysis tasks.

TL;DR: MindDrive proposes a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) to tackle challenges in autonomous driving systems using online reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of distribution shift and causal confusion in Vision-Language-Action paradigms for autonomous driving, which are heavily dependent on Imitation Learning.

Method: MindDrive utilizes two sets of LoRA parameters in a Large Language Model (LLM): one for decision-making and reasoning (Decision Expert) and another for transforming decisions into trajectories (Action Expert). It introduces a discrete linguistic decision-making process to enhance exploration and trial-and-error learning in continuous action spaces using online reinforcement learning.

Result: MindDrive achieves impressive performance benchmarks on the Bench2Drive test, with a Driving Score of 78.04 and a Success Rate of 55.09%, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MindDrive demonstrates the viability of online reinforcement learning for Vision-Language-Action models in autonomous driving, highlighting its capability to balance optimal decisions, human-like driving behavior, and efficient learning.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a supervised contrastive learning framework using a video-to-image aggregation strategy for efficient video representation learning, achieving superior results on Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets while using less computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of video transformer models and improve video representation learning using supervised contrastive learning with temporally global context.

Method: A video-to-image aggregation strategy arranges video frames spatially into single images, enabling the use of pre-trained CNNs like ResNet50. Positive pairs in contrastive learning are based on videos with the same label, and multiple views of the same video are created via frame samplings.

Result: The method outperforms ViVIT in classification accuracy, achieving 76% on Penn Action and 48% on HMDB51, while requiring fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively learns video representations for classification and captioning tasks in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy. 

Abstract: We propose a supervised contrastive learning framework for video representation learning that leverages temporally global context. We introduce a video to image aggregation strategy that spatially arranges multiple frames from each video into a single input image. This design enables the use of pre trained convolutional neural network backbones such as ResNet50 and avoids the computational overhead of complex video transformer models. We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting. Experiments on the Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in classification accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The proposed Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method learns effective video representations in both supervised and self supervised settings and supports video based tasks such as classification and captioning. The method achieves seventy six percent classification accuracy on Penn Action compared to forty three percent achieved by ViVIT and forty eight percent accuracy on HMDB51 compared to thirty seven percent achieved by ViVIT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online video understanding is critical for applications like AI glasses and surveillance, but current methods using MLLMs face challenges related to large video data, high GPU memory usage, and computational delays.

Method: A novel redundancy metric (MSSAVT) is introduced to prune tokens while considering both token similarity and spatial position, accompanied by a masked pruning strategy to prevent mutually dependent prunes. Temporal redundancy elimination techniques are also incorporated.

Result: The method improves video understanding accuracy by up to 4% with negligible additional latency of less than 1ms.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances video model efficiency and accuracy, addressing computational challenges, and its full implementation will be publicly available.

Abstract: Online video understanding is essential for applications like public surveillance and AI glasses. However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVP, a method to extend vision-language models (VLMs) to real-world environments by using multi-view physical prompts instead of just digital processing for test-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robustness in VLMs when applied to real-world sensor-mediated environments beyond web images.

Method: MVP leverages the camera's exposure settings as physical prompts. It selects optimal sensor configurations using a source-affinity metric, applies lightweight augmentations, filters low-entropy views, and aggregates predictions using a zero-temperature softmax voting mechanism.

Result: On ImageNet benchmarks, MVP outperforms digital-only test-time adaptation by up to 25.6% and standard sensor systems with TTA by 3.4%, proving both effectiveness and practicality.

Conclusion: Physical measurement-time controls significantly enhance robustness and adaptation for vision-language models, making them more effective in sensor-mediated environments.

Abstract: To extend the application of vision-language models (VLMs) from web images to sensor-mediated physical environments, we propose Multi-View Physical-prompt for Test-Time Adaptation (MVP), a forward-only framework that moves test-time adaptation (TTA) from tokens to photons by treating the camera exposure triangle--ISO, shutter speed, and aperture--as physical prompts. At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality. These results support the main claim that, beyond post-capture prompting, measurement-time control--selecting and combining real physical views--substantially improves robustness for VLMs.

Method: The framework embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos, maintaining spatiotemporal features while concealing their appearance with a steganographic approach. It introduces STeP for guided feature extraction and CroDA to reduce cover interference.

Result: StegaVAR demonstrated superior results in privacy-preserving video action recognition on widely used datasets and is compatible with multiple steganographic models.

Conclusion: The proposed StegaVAR successfully ensures both robust video action recognition and user privacy through innovative spatiotemporal techniques in the steganographic domain.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models.

*Chengzhi Liu,Yuzhe Yang,Yue Fan,Qingyue Wei,Sheng Liu,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMLR, a framework that refines multimodal reasoning by integrating dynamic perception and reasoning with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current multimodal reasoning methods, such as reliance on linear reasoning and computational overhead, by modeling cognition akin to human interaction between perception and reasoning.

Method: DMLR employs confidence-guided latent optimization and a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy for dynamic visual-textual interleaving.

Result: Experiments show improvement across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and multiple models with enhanced reasoning performance and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DMLR offers an effective solution for enhancing multimodal reasoning by interleaving dynamic visual and textual elements efficiently.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced cross-modal understanding and reasoning by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the semantic space. Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.

*Kei Yoshitake,Kento Hosono,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for generating advertisement layouts using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for better quality placements based on image content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for advertisement layouts rely on saliency mapping which doesn't fully account for image composition and semantic details.

Method: The method uses VLM to analyze images, identify objects and spatial relationships, create a placement plan, and render it into HTML code.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach yields higher-quality layouts compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Considering the detailed content of background images enhances the advertisement layout quality significantly.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for generating layouts for image-based advertisements by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Conventional advertisement layout techniques have predominantly relied on saliency mapping to detect salient regions within a background image, but such approaches often fail to fully account for the image's detailed composition and semantic content. To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based "placement plan" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts.

*Cong Xie,Che Wang,Yan Zhang,Zheng Pan,Han Zou,Zhenpeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of geometry-aware scene-consistent image generation, combining scene preservation with text-conditioned image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to balance maintaining the original scene's physical environment and adhering to textual prompts' instructions, often compromising one aspect.

Method: The authors propose (i) a new data construction process for geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a geometry-guided attention loss that uses cross-view cues to improve spatial consistency.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in maintaining scene alignment and text-image consistency, validated by automatic metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: This method achieves geometrically coherent image generation, ensuring fidelity to both the textual prompt and the original scene environment.

Abstract: We study geometry-aware scene-consistent image generation: given a reference scene image and a text condition specifying an entity to be generated in the scene and its spatial relation to the scene, the goal is to synthesize an output image that preserves the same physical environment as the reference scene while correctly generating the entity according to the spatial relation described in the text. Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies. Our method produces geometrically coherent images with diverse compositions that remain faithful to the textual instructions and the underlying scene structure.

*Tingyan Wen,Haoyu Li,Yihuang Chen,Xing Zhou,Lifei Zhu,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Slim is a cache-based accelerator for diffusion models that optimizes reuse across timesteps, structure, and space, significantly reducing latency while maintaining or slightly improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in diffusion models caused by computational overhead scaling with step count, model depth, and sequence length, and to enhance acceleration without compromising fidelity.

Method: X-Slim employs a training-free dual-threshold caching framework that aggressively reuses timestep-level features until a warning threshold, then transitions to finer-grained block- and token-level refreshes while maintaining fidelity through full inference resets when needed.

Result: X-Slim achieves up to 4.97x and 3.52x latency reductions on FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo datasets with minimal perceptual loss, and a 3.13x acceleration on DiT-XL/2 alongside an improved FID score by 2.42.

Conclusion: X-Slim offers a significant advancement in the speed-quality tradeoff for diffusion models, showing that cacheable redundancy can be exploited effectively across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Patchify, a patch-wise image retrieval framework, and LocScore, a metric assessing retrieval accuracy and spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve image retrieval accuracy, scalability, and interpretability without fine-tuning.

Method: Patchify divides images into patches, compares local patch features with global query descriptors, and integrates Product Quantization for scalability.

Result: Patchify outperforms existing methods across benchmarks and enhances reranking pipelines. Efficient large-scale retrieval is demonstrated via Product Quantization.

Conclusion: Patchify offers an effective, interpretable solution for image retrieval with improved spatial matching, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Instance-level image retrieval aims to find images containing the same object as a given query, despite variations in size, position, or appearance. To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

*Xue Li,Xiaonan Song,Henry Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP) to improve the efficiency of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by dynamically pruning tokens based on importance, significantly reducing computational costs with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the high computational demands of VLMs, which hinder their real-world deployment. The authors aim to make token processing more efficient by focusing only on the most relevant information.

Method: ATP, a lightweight dynamic inference mechanism, ranks and prunes tokens based on a hybrid importance score derived from intra-modal saliency (Vision Transformer CLS attention) and inter-modal relevance (CLIP text-image similarity). It dynamically adapts to each input without altering the backbone architecture.

Result: The method achieves a 40% reduction in inference FLOPs and approximately 1.5x end-to-end speedups with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). It maintains visual grounding, enhances interpretability, and suppresses spurious correlations under corruptions.

Conclusion: ATP demonstrates that efficient inference and model robustness can coexist, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments like edge computing. It can integrate seamlessly into existing VLM backbones for improved performance and reliability.

Abstract: Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly. We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MLLMs in fine-grained visual perception and precise spatial reasoning.

Method: DiG utilizes a 3D rendering-based data generation pipeline and curriculum learning to train models on detecting and localizing differences in paired images.

Result: DiG improves performance across visual perception benchmarks and transfers fine-grained perception skills to standard multimodal tasks like RefCOCO and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Differential grounding via the DiG framework is a scalable and robust method to advance fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved impressive performance on a variety of vision-language tasks, yet their fine-grained visual perception and precise spatial reasoning remain limited. In this work, we introduce DiG (Differential Grounding), a novel proxy task framework where MLLMs learn fine-grained perception by identifying and localizing all differences between similar image pairs without prior knowledge of their number. To support scalable training, we develop an automated 3D rendering-based data generation pipeline that produces high-quality paired images with fully controllable discrepancies. To address the sparsity of difference signals, we further employ curriculum learning that progressively increases complexity from single to multiple differences, enabling stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiG significantly improves model performance across a variety of visual perception benchmarks and that the learned fine-grained perception skills transfer effectively to standard downstream tasks, including RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and general multimodal perception benchmarks. Our results highlight differential grounding as a scalable and robust approach for advancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses cross-modal fundus image registration (CMFIR) with large field-of-view (FoV) disparity using a novel method called CARe, involving cropping and alignment procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of CMFIR in scenarios with large FoV disparity, as current methods fail under such conditions.

Method: The proposed method, CARe, incorporates a cropping operation to align source and target images' FoV and a double-fitting alignment module using RANSAC and polynomial-based coordinate fitting for enhanced spatial transformation.

Result: Through extensive experiments on 60 OCTA-wfCFP image pairs, CARe demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing CMFIR with large FoV disparity.

Conclusion: CARe is a simple yet effective approach, successfully adapting existing methods to handle large FoV disparity in CMFIR scenarios.

Abstract: Previous work on cross-modal fundus image registration (CMFIR) assumes small cross-modal Field-of-View (FoV) disparity. By contrast, this paper is targeted at a more challenging scenario with large FoV disparity, to which directly applying current methods fails. We propose Crop and Alignment for cross-modal fundus image Registration(CARe), a very simple yet effective method. Specifically, given an OCTA with smaller FoV as a source image and a wide-field color fundus photograph (wfCFP) as a target image, our Crop operation exploits the physiological structure of the retina to crop from the target image a sub-image with its FoV roughly aligned with that of the source. This operation allows us to re-purpose the previous small-FoV-disparity oriented methods for subsequent image registration. Moreover, we improve spatial transformation by a double-fitting based Alignment module that utilizes the classical RANSAC algorithm and polynomial-based coordinate fitting in a sequential manner. Extensive experiments on a newly developed test set of 60 OCTA-wfCFP pairs verify the viability of CARe for CMFIR.

Motivation: Current methods face a trade-off between handling long documents effectively and capturing detailed, multimodal content.

Method: CogDoc uses a coarse-to-fine cognitive framework with a Fast Reading phase for localization and a Focused Thinking phase for detailed reasoning, optimized using Direct RL.

Result: The 7B CogDoc model surpasses larger proprietary models like GPT-4o on complex, visually enriched document benchmarks.

Conclusion: CogDoc provides an efficient and effective approach to document reasoning, balancing scalability with detailed multimodal reasoning through a novel cognitive-inspired methodology.

Abstract: Current document reasoning paradigms are constrained by a fundamental trade-off between scalability (processing long-context documents) and fidelity (capturing fine-grained, multimodal details). To bridge this gap, we propose CogDoc, a unified coarse-to-fine thinking framework that mimics human cognitive processes: a low-resolution "Fast Reading" phase for scalable information localization,followed by a high-resolution "Focused Thinking" phase for deep reasoning. We conduct a rigorous investigation into post-training strategies for the unified thinking framework, demonstrating that a Direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach outperforms RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) initialization. Specifically, we find that direct RL avoids the "policy conflict" observed in SFT. Empirically, our 7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance within its parameter class, notably surpassing significantly larger proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) on challenging, visually rich document benchmarks.

Motivation: Automated segmentation of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images faces challenges like ambiguous boundaries, size variations, and limited annotated data.

Method: Proposed SSMT-Net uses a semi-supervised, Transformer-based approach with unsupervised pre-training and optimization of multiple tasks (segmentation and size estimation).

Result: SSMT-Net achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods on TN3K and DDTI test datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SSMT-Net has significant potential for real-world clinical applications due to its accuracy and robustness in thyroid nodule segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, ambiguous boundaries between nodules and surrounding tissues, size variations, and the scarcity of annotated ultrasound data pose significant challenges for automated segmentation. Existing deep learning models struggle to incorporate contextual information from the thyroid gland and generalize effectively across diverse cases. To address these challenges, we propose SSMT-Net, a Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Transformer-based Network that leverages unlabeled data to enhance Transformer-centric encoder feature extraction capability in an initial unsupervised phase. In the supervised phase, the model jointly optimizes nodule segmentation, gland segmentation, and nodule size estimation, integrating both local and global contextual features. Extensive evaluations on the TN3K and DDTI datasets demonstrate that SSMT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with higher accuracy and robustness, indicating its potential for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: InteracTalker is a framework that generates realistic human motions responding to speech and object interactions, utilizing a unified embedding space and adaptive fusion strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in generating motions driven by speech and object interactions separately, hampered by a lack of integrated datasets.

Method: Introduced a multi-stage training process with a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space, supported by an extended dataset with object interaction annotations.

Result: Outperformed existing methods in generating co-speech gestures and object interaction motions, offering enhanced realism and control.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies speech-driven gesture generation and object-aware motion synthesis, expanding realism and flexibility in digital experiences.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions that naturally respond to both spoken language and physical objects is crucial for interactive digital experiences. Current methods, however, address speech-driven gestures or object interactions independently, limiting real-world applicability due to a lack of integrated, comprehensive datasets. To overcome this, we introduce InteracTalker, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates prompt-based object-aware interactions with co-speech gesture generation. We achieve this by employing a multi-stage training process to learn a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space. To support this, we curate a rich human-object interaction dataset, formed by augmenting an existing text-to-motion dataset with detailed object interaction annotations. Our framework utilizes a Generalized Motion Adaptation Module that enables independent training, adapting to the corresponding motion condition, which is then dynamically combined during inference. To address the imbalance between heterogeneous conditioning signals, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy, which dynamically reweights the conditioning signals during diffusion sampling. InteracTalker successfully unifies these previously separate tasks, outperforming prior methods in both co-speech gesture generation and object-interaction synthesis, outperforming gesture-focused diffusion methods, yielding highly realistic, object-aware full-body motions with enhanced realism, flexibility, and control.

### [232] [Open-World Deepfake Attribution via Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12667)
*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Teng Long,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) for better attribution of deepfake forgeries, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in synthetic face imagery drives the need to accurately attribute forgeries under open-world conditions where known and unknown forgery types coexist.

Method: The CAL framework employs Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) to balance pseudo-label bias and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR) to separately calibrate confidence in known and novel forgery types. Additionally, a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy estimates novel forgery types dynamically.

Result: CAL outperforms previous methods on standard and newly extended OW-DFA benchmarks, demonstrating its superior capability in both known and novel forgery attribution.

Conclusion: CAL framework provides a scalable, robust solution to OW-DFA, addressing key challenges like pseudo-label bias and prior assumptions of unknown forgery types.

Abstract: The proliferation of synthetic facial imagery has intensified the need for robust Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to attribute both known and unknown forgeries using labeled data for known types and unlabeled data containing a mixture of known and novel types. However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach to improve the performance of transformer models on new target domains through online test-time adaptation by recalibrating self-attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle performance degradation of transformer models when applied to domains different from the original training domain due to significant feature changes in the self-attention module.

Method: The method introduces a progressive self-attention recalibration using local linear transforms. These are parameterized by scale and shift factors, which are predicted through domain separation and factor generation networks. The lightweight networks are updated online during inference.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvement in accuracy for online test-time domain adaptation, with an increase of up to 3.9% on ImageNet-C.

Conclusion: PCSR demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamically recalibrating transformers for different domains, enhancing their adaptability and accuracy in real-world applications.

Abstract: Online test-time adaptation aims to dynamically adjust a network model in real-time based on sequential input samples during the inference stage. In this work, we find that, when applying a transformer network model to a new target domain, the Query, Key, and Value features of its self-attention module often change significantly from those in the source domain, leading to substantial performance degradation of the transformer model. To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluated intelligent systems for heart disease prediction, focusing on fuzzy logic, neural networks, and case-based reasoning (CBR). CBR achieved a 97.95% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heart disease prediction relying on doctors' experience is often imprecise; the study aimed to explore intelligent systems as an alternative for improved accuracy.

Method: Three intelligent systems (Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning) were compared for accuracy. Data underwent pre-processing and splitting before applying the selected method (CBR).

Result: CBR demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy at 97.95%. The study identified heart disease incidence rates as 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Smoking and alcohol were noted as significant contributors.

Conclusion: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a highly accurate method for heart disease prediction and highlights the impact of lifestyle factors, particularly in males.

Abstract: This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scone, a model addressing multi-subject image generation with distinction, ensuring correct subject identification and composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of distinction in multi-subject image generation, which limits practical application in complex settings.

Method: The Scone model employs a unified understanding-generation approach with a two-stage training scheme: learning composition first, then enhancing distinction with semantic alignment and attention-based masking.

Result: Scone outperformed existing open-source models in both composition and distinction tasks on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scone effectively integrates subject distinction and composition for improved multi-subject image generation, offering new benchmarks and data to the community.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation has advanced from single- to multi-subject composition, while neglecting distinction, the ability to identify and generate the correct subject when inputs contain multiple candidates. This limitation restricts effectiveness in complex, realistic visual settings. We propose Scone, a unified understanding-generation method that integrates composition and distinction. Scone enables the understanding expert to act as a semantic bridge, conveying semantic information and guiding the generation expert to preserve subject identity while minimizing interference. A two-stage training scheme first learns composition, then enhances distinction through semantic alignment and attention-based masking. We also introduce SconeEval, a benchmark for evaluating both composition and distinction across diverse scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that Scone outperforms existing open-source models in composition and distinction tasks on two benchmarks.

*Fatimah Zohra,Chen Zhao,Hani Itani,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $β$-CLIP introduces a multi-granular framework to enhance hierarchical alignment between textual and visual content for improving dense correspondence in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with fine-grained tasks despite strong performance in zero-shot scenarios, necessitating enhanced alignment strategies for detailed vision-language tasks.

Method: $β$-CLIP uses cross-attention for hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities and corresponding image patches, supported by $β$-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss for optimized semantic alignment.

Result: $β$-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in dense alignment tasks, evidenced by improvements in R@1 metrics on Urban1K and FG-OVD datasets for vision-language correspondence.

Conclusion: This paper presents $β$-CLIP as an adaptive and effective framework for tackling dense vision-language correspondence, setting new benchmarks for performance in its category.

Abstract: CLIP achieves strong zero-shot image-text retrieval by aligning global vision and text representations, yet it falls behind on fine-grained tasks even when fine-tuned on long, detailed captions. In this work, we propose $β$-CLIP, a multi-granular text-conditioned contrastive learning framework designed to achieve hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities-from full captions to sentences and phrases-and their corresponding visual regions. For each level of granularity, $β$-CLIP utilizes cross-attention to dynamically pool image patches, producing contextualized visual embeddings. To address the semantic overlap inherent in this hierarchy, we introduce the $β$-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss ($β$-CAL). This objective parameterizes the trade-off between strict query-specific matching and relaxed intra-image contextualization, supporting both soft Cross-Entropy and hard Binary Cross-Entropy formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $β$-CLIP significantly improves dense alignment: achieving 91.8% T2I 92.3% I2T at R@1 on Urban1K and 30.9% on FG-OVD (Hard), setting state-of-the-art among methods trained without hard negatives. $β$-CLIP establishes a robust, adaptive baseline for dense vision-language correspondence.

*Boyuan Li,Sipeng Zheng,Bin Cao,Ruihua Song,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a part-aware model to extract human motion data from incomplete web videos, introducing a new K700-M benchmark for evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in character animation and handle incomplete or occluded motion data in large-scale web videos.

Method: The authors divide the human body into five parts, encode credible parts using part-aware VAE, and use a masked generation model to predict masked parts while disregarding noisy ones.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency, and diversity on both clean and noisy datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves motion generation and tackles incomplete data issues effectively, as demonstrated through a new challenging benchmark (K700-M).

Abstract: Extracting human motion from large-scale web videos offers a scalable solution to the data scarcity issue in character animation. However, some human parts in many video frames cannot be seen due to off-screen captures or occlusions. It brings a dilemma: discarding the data missing any part limits scale and diversity, while retaining it compromises data quality and model performance.
  To address this problem, we propose leveraging credible part-level data extracted from videos to enhance motion generation via a robust part-aware masked autoregression model. First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as "credible". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.
  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a system to restore the 3D shape of the human body and estimate the spine center line using depth images from four directions, improving on multi-image and single-image methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing body restoration methods: high cost and complexity in multi-image methods, and occlusion and viewpoint challenges in single-image methods.

Method: A 3D body posture analysis using hierarchical matching for noise/occlusion recovery and Adaptive Vertex Reduction for maintaining mesh resolution. Spine estimation benefits from scalable Level of Detail ensemble.

Result: The method achieved accurate 3D spine center line estimation without relying on training data or complex neural networks, with improved matching quality.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively overcomes shortcomings of existing methods, offering a precise, stable, and efficient solution for 3D spine registration.

Abstract: The spinal angle is an important indicator of body balance. It is important to restore the 3D shape of the human body and estimate the spine center line. Existing mul-ti-image-based body restoration methods require expensive equipment and complex pro-cedures, and single image-based body restoration methods have limitations in that it is difficult to accurately estimate the internal structure such as the spine center line due to occlusion and viewpoint limitation. This study proposes a method to compensate for the shortcomings of the multi-image-based method and to solve the limitations of the sin-gle-image method. We propose a 3D body posture analysis system that integrates depth images from four directions to restore a 3D human model and automatically estimate the spine center line. Through hierarchical matching of global and fine registration, restora-tion to noise and occlusion is performed. Also, the Adaptive Vertex Reduction is applied to maintain the resolution and shape reliability of the mesh, and the accuracy and stabil-ity of spinal angle estimation are simultaneously secured by using the Level of Detail en-semble. The proposed method achieves high-precision 3D spine registration estimation without relying on training data or complex neural network models, and the verification confirms the improvement of matching quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenieDrive introduces a physics-aware driving video generation framework using 4D occupancy as a foundation for better control, accuracy, and video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in driving video generation like difficulty in learning and physically inconsistent outputs stemming from reliance on single diffusion models.

Method: Uses 4D occupancy as a foundation, leverages a VAE for compression into a latent tri-plane representation, introduces Mutual Control Attention (MCA) for control-occupancy accuracy, and Normalized Multi-View Attention for video quality.

Result: Achieved a 7.2% forecasting accuracy improvement (mIoU), 20.7% FVD reduction, and high inference speed (41 FPS) with only 3.47 M parameters.

Conclusion: GenieDrive significantly enhances controllability, consistency, and physical realism in multi-view driving video generation, demonstrating superior performance in experiments.

Abstract: Physics-aware driving world model is essential for drive planning, out-of-distribution data synthesis, and closed-loop evaluation. However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation. Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD. Experiments demonstrate that GenieDrive enables highly controllable, multi-view consistent, and physics-aware driving video generation.

Motivation: Current benchmarks lack comprehensive coverage of multiple modalities with limited interdependence and complementarity, hindering advancements in multimodal architectures.

Method: FysicsWorld offers 16 tasks with 3,268 curated samples aggregated from over 40 sources to evaluate any-to-any modality interactions. It uses Cross-Modal Complementarity Screening (CMCS) to create omni-modal data for reasoning and generation.

Result: Evaluation shows disparities in performance across over 30 state-of-the-art multimodal and omni-modal models, highlighting limitations in current architectures.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a unified platform for advancing full-modality architectures by addressing current gaps in multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and emerging omni-modal architectures, current benchmarks remain limited in scope and integration, suffering from incomplete modality coverage, restricted interaction to text-centric outputs, and weak interdependence and complementarity among modalities. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FysicsWorld, the first unified full-modality benchmark that supports bidirectional input-output across image, video, audio, and text, enabling comprehensive any-to-any evaluation across understanding, generation, and reasoning. FysicsWorld encompasses 16 primary tasks and 3,268 curated samples, aggregated from over 40 high-quality sources and covering a rich set of open-domain categories with diverse question types. We also propose the Cross-Modal Complementarity Screening (CMCS) strategy integrated in a systematic data construction framework that produces omni-modal data for spoken interaction and fusion-dependent cross-modal reasoning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 state-of-the-art baselines, spanning MLLMs, modality-specific models, unified understanding-generation models, and omni-modal language models, FysicsWorld exposes the performance disparities and limitations across models in understanding, generation, and reasoning. Our benchmark establishes a unified foundation and strong baselines for evaluating and advancing next-generation full-modality architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe3D introduces a framework that integrates reasoning over semantic and spatial abstractions to enhance 3D understanding and generation, guided by linguistic descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of development in reasoning-centric approaches for 3D tasks compared to language and vision models.

Method: The model employs spatially grounded reasoning by decomposing the 3D latent space into localized regions, coupled with semantic chain-of-thought inference for procedural and compositional geometry reasoning.

Result: CoRe3D generates 3D outputs with strong local consistency and closely aligned with textual descriptions.

Conclusion: Spatial and semantic reasoning incorporated in CoRe3D provides a significant advancement for reliable, interpretable, and aligned 3D content generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models suggest that explicit reasoning mechanisms play a critical role in improving model reliability, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment. While such reasoning-centric approaches have been proven effective in language and vision tasks, their extension to 3D remains underdeveloped. CoRe3D introduces a unified 3D understanding and generation reasoning framework that jointly operates over semantic and spatial abstractions, enabling high-level intent inferred from language to directly guide low-level 3D content formation. Central to this design is a spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, allowing the model to reason over geometry in a compositional and procedural manner. By tightly coupling semantic chain-of-thought inference with structured spatial reasoning, CoRe3D produces 3D outputs that exhibit strong local consistency and faithful alignment with linguistic descriptions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Fast-2DGS,' a lightweight framework enabling fast, high-quality Gaussian image representation using a disentangled architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, interpretable, and editable image representations has grown with the advancement of high-fidelity generative models. Current 2D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with computational inefficiencies and slow convergence, necessitating improvements.

Method: The authors present a framework called Fast-2DGS, featuring a Deep Gaussian Prior implemented as a conditional network for spatial distribution and an attribute regression network for dense Gaussian properties. This enables quick reconstruction with minimal fine-tuning.

Result: Fast-2DGS achieves single-pass high-quality image reconstruction with reduced computational cost while maintaining visual quality, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: Fast-2DGS simplifies and enhances the efficiency of 2D Gaussian Splatting, making real-time, high-quality image representation more practical, and advancing its readiness for industrial applications.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly capable of producing high-fidelity visual content, the demand for efficient, interpretable, and editable image representations has grown substantially. Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method for neural video compression, which addresses issues in temporal context prediction and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings in temporal context prediction, including limited reference windows and feature-only propagation, which lead to error accumulation and loss of fine details in neural video compression.

Method: Proposes L-STEC, which uses LSTM for long-term dependency capture and integrates warped pixel domain spatial context with spatio-temporal fusion through a multi-receptive field network.

Result: L-STEC improves compression performance, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, surpassing established methods like VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM.

Conclusion: L-STEC sets a new benchmark for neural video compression by leveraging enriched contextual information for better performance.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression has emerged in recent years, with condition-based frameworks outperforming traditional codecs. However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DrivePI introduces a spatial-aware 4D multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for autonomous driving that combines spatial understanding, 3D perception, prediction, and planning in a unified framework. It achieves superior performance compared to existing models in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in autonomous driving by applying multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for generating precise 3D spatial perception and prediction outputs, which remains underexplored.

Method: DrivePI integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions into a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework. The model uses end-to-end optimization to jointly handle spatial understanding, 3D perception, prediction, and planning tasks. A data engine is developed to generate text-occupancy and text-flow datasets for training.

Result: DrivePI matches or outperforms existing VLA and specialized VA models in various autonomous driving benchmarks. It exhibits better spatial understanding, 3D occupancy, flow prediction, and planning performance while reducing collision rates significantly.

Conclusion: DrivePI demonstrates that MLLMs can be effectively employed for precise and unified 3D perception, prediction, and planning in autonomous driving. It sets a new benchmark by outperforming state-of-the-art models both in accuracy and safety measures.

Abstract: Although multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application in generating fine-grained 3D perception and prediction outputs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for Contrastive Analysis (CA) to distinguish common and salient generative factors between two image datasets, using only dataset-level signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the less-studied problem of separating shared and unique generative factors in image datasets, without relying on explicit attribute supervision.

Method: A CA framework is proposed, adaptable to GAN and Diffusion models, with newly defined learning strategies and losses to separate common and salient factors while maintaining image quality.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms prior methods in both factor separation and image quality synthesis across diverse datasets, including faces, animals, and medical scans.

Conclusion: The proposed CA framework enables effective disentanglement of common and dataset-specific generative factors while achieving high-quality image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis have enabled high-quality image generation and manipulation. Most works focus on: 1) conditional manipulation, where an image is modified conditioned on a given attribute, or 2) disentangled representation learning, where each latent direction should represent a distinct semantic attribute. In this paper, we focus on a different and less studied research problem, called Contrastive Analysis (CA). Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors. By defining new and well-adapted learning strategies and losses, we ensure a relevant separation between common and salient factors, preserving a high-quality generation. We evaluate our approach on diverse datasets, covering human faces, animal images and medical scans. Our framework demonstrates superior separation ability and image quality synthesis compared to prior methods.

Result: Lemon achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object recognition, captioning, and spatial reasoning while demonstrating robust scalability with increasing model size and data.

Conclusion: Lemon provides a unified, scalable approach to advancing 3D spatial intelligence, paving the way for real-world applications in 3D understanding.

Abstract: Scaling large multimodal models (LMMs) to 3D understanding poses unique challenges: point cloud data is sparse and irregular, existing models rely on fragmented architectures with modality-specific encoders, and training pipelines often suffer from instability and poor scalability. We introduce Lemon, a unified transformer architecture that addresses these challenges by jointly processing 3D point cloud patches and language tokens as a single sequence. Unlike prior work that relies on modality-specific encoders and cross-modal alignment modules, this design enables early spatial-linguistic fusion, eliminates redundant encoders, improves parameter efficiency, and supports more effective model scaling. To handle the complexity of 3D data, we develop a structured patchification and tokenization scheme that preserves spatial context, and a three-stage training curriculum that progressively builds capabilities from object-level recognition to scene-level spatial reasoning. Lemon establishes new state-of-the-art performance across comprehensive 3D understanding and reasoning tasks, from object recognition and captioning to spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, while demonstrating robust scaling properties as model size and training data increase. Our work provides a unified foundation for advancing 3D spatial intelligence in real-world applications.

Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how CoCa, a generative-contrastive hybrid model, can be adapted for downstream tasks in few-shot settings, as opposed to widely-studied dual-encoder models like CLIP.

Method: A comprehensive empirical study evaluates parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies such as hybrid prototyping and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and examines training configurations under few-shot conditions.

Result: Findings highlight the necessity of balancing augmentation divergence, the utility of supervised contrastive loss for better performance, and the importance of tuning regularization, rank, and sampling based on data scarcity.

Conclusion: The study provides practical recommendations for fine-tuning generative-contrastive models like CoCa in data-limited settings, paving the way for improved few-shot learning adaptation.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal foundation models, particularly Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), have achieved state-of-the-art results by unifying contrastive alignment with generative captioning. While zero-shot transfer capabilities are well-documented, the adaptation of these generative-contrastive hybrids to downstream tasks with extreme data scarcity (few-shot learning) remains under-explored. Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an "augmentation divergence": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint audio-visual editing is challenging due to limited paired data and cross-modal differences, necessitating effective solutions.

Method: Authors developed SAVEBench, a dataset, and the SAVE model utilizing a Schrodinger Bridge for end-to-end flow-matching in joint editing.

Result: SAVE demonstrated effective target object removal in audio and video, preserving synchronization and audiovisual semantic correspondence.

Conclusion: SAVE and SAVEBench provide a more integrated and synchronized solution for audiovisual editing compared to traditional separate tools.

Abstract: Joint editing of audio and visual content is crucial for precise and controllable content creation. This new task poses challenges due to the limitations of paired audio-visual data before and after targeted edits, and the heterogeneity across modalities. To address the data and modeling challenges in joint audio-visual editing, we introduce SAVEBench, a paired audiovisual dataset with text and mask conditions to enable object-grounded source-to-target learning. With SAVEBench, we train the Schrodinger Audio-Visual Editor (SAVE), an end-to-end flow-matching model that edits audio and video in parallel while keeping them aligned throughout processing. SAVE incorporates a Schrodinger Bridge that learns a direct transport from source to target audiovisual mixtures. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed SAVE model is able to remove the target objects in audio and visual content while preserving the remaining content, with stronger temporal synchronization and audiovisual semantic correspondence compared with pairwise combinations of an audio editor and a video editor.

Conclusion: This research highlights that general-purpose foundation models, when effectively adapted, can overcome task-specific limitations and achieve consistent, high-performance results in 3D medical image classification.

Abstract: 3D medical image classification is essential for modern clinical workflows. Medical foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for scaling to new tasks, yet current research suffers from three critical pitfalls: data-regime bias, suboptimal adaptation, and insufficient task coverage. In this paper, we address these pitfalls and introduce AnyMC3D, a scalable 3D classifier adapted from 2D FMs. Our method scales efficiently to new tasks by adding only lightweight plugins (about 1M parameters per task) on top of a single frozen backbone. This versatile framework also supports multi-view inputs, auxiliary pixel-level supervision, and interpretable heatmap generation. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 12 tasks covering diverse pathologies, anatomies, and modalities, and systematically analyze state-of-the-art 3D classification techniques. Our analysis reveals key insights: (1) effective adaptation is essential to unlock FM potential, (2) general-purpose FMs can match medical-specific FMs if properly adapted, and (3) 2D-based methods surpass 3D architectures for 3D classification. For the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse applications using a single scalable framework (including 1st place in the VLM3D challenge), eliminating the need for separate task-specific models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks face challenges in learning high-frequency signals due to spectral bias and optimization issues, and current methods like Fourier encodings show room for improvement.

Method: Qonvolutions utilize convolutional neighborhood properties to combine low-frequency signals with queries (like coordinates) for better high-frequency signal learning.

Conclusion: Qonvolutions are effective in enhancing high-frequency learning tasks, offering superior image quality compared to radiance field models.

Abstract: Accurately learning high-frequency signals is a challenge in computer vision and graphics, as neural networks often struggle with these signals due to spectral bias or optimization difficulties. While current techniques like Fourier encodings have made great strides in improving performance, there remains scope for improvement when presented with high-frequency information. This paper introduces Queried-Convolutions (Qonvolutions), a simple yet powerful modification using the neighborhood properties of convolution. Qonvolution convolves a low-frequency signal with queries (such as coordinates) to enhance the learning of intricate high-frequency signals. We empirically demonstrate that Qonvolutions enhance performance across a variety of high-frequency learning tasks crucial to both the computer vision and graphics communities, including 1D regression, 2D super-resolution, 2D image regression, and novel view synthesis (NVS). In particular, by combining Gaussian splatting with Qonvolutions for NVS, we showcase state-of-the-art performance on real-world complex scenes, even outperforming powerful radiance field models on image quality.

### [252] [Predictive Sample Assignment for Semantically Coherent Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12906)
*Zhimao Peng,Enguang Wang,Xialei Liu,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Semantically Coherent Out-of-Distribution Detection (SCOOD) problem by introducing a framework called Predictive Sample Assignment (PSA) to improve ID/OOD discrimination and eliminate training noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving out-of-distribution detection under the SCOOD setting, where significant noise in current methods hampers accurate discrimination between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples.

Method: The PSA framework features a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy using predictive energy scores to filter unlabeled data into ID, OOD, and discard sets while enhancing ID and OOD separation with a contrastive representation learning loss and retraining process.

Result: Experimental evaluations on two SCOOD benchmarks highlight the PSA framework achieving significantly better detection performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The PSA framework effectively improves the SCOOD task by reducing the noise in ID/OOD classification and enhancing overall model performance using predictive energy-based filtering and representation learning.

Abstract: Semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SCOOD) is a recently proposed realistic OOD detection setting: given labeled in-distribution (ID) data and mixed in-distribution and out-of-distribution unlabeled data as the training data, SCOOD aims to enable the trained model to accurately identify OOD samples in the testing data. Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA). PSA includes a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy based on the predictive energy score that can significantly improve the purity of the selected ID and OOD sample sets by assigning unconfident unlabeled data to an additional discard sample set, and a concept contrastive representation learning loss to further expand the distance between ID and OOD samples in the representation space to assist ID/OOD discrimination. In addition, we also introduce a retraining strategy to help the model fully fit the selected auxiliary ID/OOD samples. Experiments on two standard SCOOD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

*Zhimao Peng,Enguang Wang,Fei Yang,Xialei Liu,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to address noise in pseudo-labels for generalized category discovery (GCD), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clustering performance in GCD by mitigating noise in pseudo-labels caused by spurious correlations in large pre-trained models.

Method: The method introduces Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) for reducing noise and overfitting, and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) for selecting representative samples and improving feature learning for unknown classes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing pseudo-label noise and achieving better results on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances pseudo-labeling strategies for GCD, providing state-of-the-art performance and addressing challenges in clustering unlabeled datasets with known and unknown classes.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is an important and challenging task in open-world learning. Specifically, given some labeled data of known classes, GCD aims to cluster unlabeled data that contain both known and unknown classes. Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks.

TL;DR: MADTempo introduces a video retrieval system focusing on temporal reasoning in videos and enhanced search capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems struggle with modeling temporal dependencies and handling rare or unseen visual concepts, especially for complex multi-event queries.

Method: MADTempo employs a temporal search mechanism aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments and integrates a Google Image Search-based fallback for better query representation.

Result: The framework enhances temporal reasoning and generalization of video retrieval systems, showing improvements in retrieving multi-event and out-of-distribution queries.

Conclusion: MADTempo significantly improves video retrieval by unifying temporal search with robust external visual grounding, making systems more semantically aware and adaptable.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video content across online platforms has accelerated the need for retrieval systems capable of understanding not only isolated visual moments but also the temporal structure of complex events. Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. Together, these components advance the temporal reasoning and generalization capabilities of modern video retrieval systems, paving the way for more semantically aware and adaptive retrieval across large-scale video corpora.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal moment retrieval by proposing a system with innovations in embedding pipelines, temporal scoring, and automated query decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and limitations in existing multimodal moment retrieval systems caused by fixed fusion strategies, weak temporal modeling, and manual modality selection.

Method: The authors introduce a system with three features: a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline for improved retrieval, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism for coherent event sequences, and GPT-4o for automatic query decomposition and adaptive score fusion.

Result: The proposed system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of multimodal moment retrieval with innovations that improve system usability, accuracy, and handling of ambiguous inputs.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has created an urgent need for efficient multimodal moment retrieval systems. However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance limitations of generalized end-to-end video compression frameworks by incorporating content-specific adaptive strategies.

Method: The paper proposes a three-part approach: (1) refining motion compensation using a two-stage deformable warping mechanism, (2) integrating a multi-reference quality-aware strategy for hierarchical training, and (3) employing a training-free module that downsamples frames based on motion characteristics.

Result: Experimental evaluation indicates that CAMA achieves a 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings compared to the baseline DCVC-TCM model, while outperforming other state-of-the-art neural and traditional codecs.

Conclusion: The CAMA framework validates the effectiveness of content-specific adaptation in video compression, showcasing improved performance and efficiency over existing methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end video compression have shown promising results owing to their unified end-to-end learning optimization. However, such generalized frameworks often lack content-specific adaptation, leading to suboptimal compression performance. To address this, this paper proposes a content adaptive based motion alignment framework that improves performance by adapting encoding strategies to diverse content characteristics. Specifically, we first introduce a two-stage flow-guided deformable warping mechanism that refines motion compensation with coarse-to-fine offset prediction and mask modulation, enabling precise feature alignment. Second, we propose a multi-reference quality aware strategy that adjusts distortion weights based on reference quality, and applies it to hierarchical training to reduce error propagation. Third, we integrate a training-free module that downsamples frames by motion magnitude and resolution to obtain smooth motion estimation. Experimental results on standard test datasets demonstrate that our framework CAMA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art Neural Video Compression models, achieving a 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings over our baseline model DCVC-TCM, while also outperforming reproduced DCVC-DC and traditional codec HM-16.25.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAGLNet, a novel network fusing global-local visual semantics for precise building extraction from remote sensing images, overcoming feature integration issues with uncertainty modeling. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building extraction via remote sensing faces challenges due to varied building structures and limitations in feature pyramid models and global-local integration.

Method: The authors present UAGLNet with a cooperative encoder combining CNN and transformers, a Global-Local Fusion module, and an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder for enhanced feature integration and uncertainty mitigation.

Result: Experiments show that UAGLNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in building extraction tasks.

Conclusion: UAGLNet effectively addresses ambiguity in segmentation and integrates global-local features for accurate building extraction, showcasing promising results.

Abstract: Building extraction from remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the complex structure variations of the buildings. Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet

Motivation: To improve photo-realistic style transfer with diffusion models, which struggle with unwanted influence from original content styles and lack precision in transferring detailed stylistic elements.

Method: SCAdapter utilizes three components: CSAdaIN for multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective. It also eliminates DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization for efficiency.

Result: SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in photo-realistic style transfer, demonstrating higher transfer quality and achieving at least twice the inference speed compared to diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: SCAdapter advances style transfer methods by addressing key challenges in diffusion models, providing improved quality and efficiency suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in multimodal input processing by reducing recomputation for recurring inputs, enhancing computational efficiency in real-world applications.

Method: The method involves formally identifying errors in cache reuse, implementing a layer-aware recomputation strategy, and leveraging key-value and encoder caches to maximize computational reuse and minimize errors.

Result: Experimental results show that VLCache provides comparable accuracy to full recomputation while achieving up to 16x speed improvements and requiring only 2-5% computation of total tokens.

Conclusion: VLCache is a highly effective framework for multimodal processing, balancing speed and accuracy, and has been successfully deployed in practical applications like SGLang for faster inference.

Abstract: This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. The proposed VLCache pipeline has been integrated into SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

TL;DR: A paradoxical phenomenon termed the 'Benefit then Conflict dilemma' is identified in AI-generated image detectors where increasing data diversity results in performance degradation. A new framework, Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), addresses this with improved detection capability.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations in generalization of AI-generated image detectors when aggregating diverse data, which leads to performance stagnation and degradation.

Method: Introduce GAPL—a structured learning paradigm that develops canonical forgery prototypes to counter heterogeneity and uses a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation to enhance model adaptability.

Result: GAPL achieves state-of-the-art results with superior detection accuracy for GAN and diffusion-based generators.

Conclusion: GAPL effectively addresses the data heterogeneity and model bottleneck issues in AI-generated image detection, providing a generalizable, robust solution supported by experimental validation.

Abstract: The pursuit of a universal AI-generated image (AIGI) detector often relies on aggregating data from numerous generators to improve generalization. However, this paper identifies a paradoxical phenomenon we term the Benefit then Conflict dilemma, where detector performance stagnates and eventually degrades as source diversity expands. Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing superior detection accuracy across a wide variety of GAN and diffusion-based generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerability of CLIP to adversarial attacks by introducing a novel fine-tuning method to improve uncertainty calibration while retaining adversarial robustness and clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks which compromise its robust prediction and uncertainty calibration.

Method: The authors propose reparameterizing CLIP’s output as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution to holistically align prediction accuracy and uncertainty under adversarial perturbations.

Result: The proposed method successfully restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy in zero-shot classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: By focusing on uncertainty calibration alongside accuracy under adversarial conditions, the paper bridges a critical reliability gap in CLIP's performance, enhancing its robustness and calibration.

Abstract: CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.

Abstract: Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

### [264] [TWLR: Text-Guided Weakly-Supervised Lesion Localization and Severity Regression for Explainable Diabetic Retinopathy Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13008)
*Xi Luo,Shixin Xu,Ying Xie,JianZhong Hu,Yuwei He,Yuhui Deng,Huaxiong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TWLR is a two-stage framework for interpretable and efficient diabetic retinopathy assessment, offering competitive performance in grading and segmentation without extensive annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of costly pixel-level annotations and a lack of interpretability in medical imaging for diabetic retinopathy.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) Vision-language model for grading and lesion classification, integrating ophthalmological knowledge, and 2) iterative severity regression incorporating weakly-supervised semantic segmentation and refining saliency maps.

Result: TWLR achieves strong performance in DR classification and lesion segmentation on datasets like FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset, enhancing annotation efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: TWLR provides an annotation-efficient, accurate, and interpretable framework for analyzing retinal images suitable for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate medical image analysis can greatly assist clinical diagnosis, but its effectiveness relies on high-quality expert annotations Obtaining pixel-level labels for medical images, particularly fundus images, remains costly and time-consuming. Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis.

*Haoyu Wang,Lei Zhang,Wenrui Liu,Dengyang Jiang,Wei Wei,Chen Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces JoDiffusion, a novel framework for generating synthetic datasets with paired images and annotation masks using diffusion models and variational auto-encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation for semantic segmentation is costly and time-consuming. Existing methods face issues of semantic inconsistency or limited scalability when generating synthetic datasets.

Method: JoDiffusion integrates a latent diffusion model with an independent annotation VAE network, enabling joint generation of images and consistent annotation masks conditioned on text prompts. It also includes a mask optimization strategy to reduce noise.

Result: Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic segmentation performance using JoDiffusion-generated datasets.

Conclusion: JoDiffusion effectively addresses scalability and semantic consistency issues, making it a promising approach for efficient and high-quality dataset generation in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Given the inherently costly and time-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation, the generation of synthetic datasets comprising sufficiently diverse synthetic images paired with ground-truth pixel-level annotations has garnered increasing attention recently for training high-performance semantic segmentation models. However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods.

*Xinjie Li,Zhimin Chen,Rui Zhao,Florian Schiffers,Zhenyu Liao,Vimal Bhat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Next Scene Prediction (NSP) task to improve unified video models' temporal and causal reasoning by predicting future scenes. A novel framework and large-scale dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified models focus on text-to-video generation but do not explore their potential for temporal reasoning, creating a gap in understanding sequential events.

Method: The authors propose a model combining Qwen-VL for comprehension and LTX for synthesis, connected via a latent query embedding. Training involves text-to-video pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with a causal consistency reward on a new NSP dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly introduced NSP benchmark, showcasing improved temporal and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: This work advances unified multimodal systems, enabling them to better forecast plausible future events and reinforcing their understanding of temporal causality.

Abstract: Recent unified models for joint understanding and generation have significantly advanced visual generation capabilities. However, their focus on conventional tasks like text-to-video generation has left the temporal reasoning potential of unified models largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Next Scene Prediction (NSP), a new task that pushes unified video models toward temporal and causal reasoning. Unlike text-to-video generation, NSP requires predicting plausible futures from preceding context, demanding deeper understanding and reasoning. To tackle this task, we propose a unified framework combining Qwen-VL for comprehension and LTX for synthesis, bridged by a latent query embedding and a connector module. This model is trained in three stages on our newly curated, large-scale NSP dataset: text-to-video pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning (via GRPO) with our proposed causal consistency reward. Experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark, advancing the capability of generalist multimodal systems to anticipate what happens next.

*Tomoya Tanaka,Tomonori Ikeda,Ryo Yonemoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates spatial generalization techniques for deep learning-based RF sensing, using MIMO radar for people counting in indoor environments. The study identifies effective methods like sigmoid-based amplitude weighting, data augmentation, and transfer learning for improving performance under spatial variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying deep learning-based RF sensing systems in various spatial layouts by developing generalization techniques to maintain accuracy across different environments.

Method: The study evaluates various techniques such as amplitude-based statistical preprocessing, frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation, and transfer learning. It uses experimental data collected in two distinct environments.

Result: Sigmoid-based amplitude weighting showed the best cross-environment performance, reducing RMSE and MAE significantly. Data augmentation provided moderate improvements, while transfer learning effectively addressed large spatial shifts, significantly lowering RMSE and MAE.

Conclusion: The findings highlight practical strategies for ensuring robust accuracy in radar sensing systems despite spatial variations, through the integration of amplitude-based preprocessing and transfer learning with deep learning models.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of spatial generalization techniques, which are essential for the practical deployment of deep learning-based radio-frequency (RF) sensing. Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning.

TL;DR: SneakPeek is a framework for generating temporally consistent instructional videos from textual descriptions using a diffusion-based autoregressive approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generating temporally consistent and controlled instructional videos, which are crucial for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction.

Method: SneakPeek introduces predictive causal adaptation for next-frame prediction, future-guided self-forcing to mitigate exposure bias, and multi-prompt conditioning for fine-grained control.

Result: The method generates temporally coherent and accurate videos that faithfully follow multi-step task descriptions.

Conclusion: SneakPeek enhances the consistency and controllability of instructional video generation, supporting dynamic, stepwise, and semantically accurate video synthesis.

Abstract: Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

*Tomoya Tanaka,Tomonori Ikeda,Ryo Yonemoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates rule-based, traditional machine learning, and deep learning models for radio wave sensing in radar systems, focusing on their performance across varying indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to compare the performance and robustness of different computational methods in radar-based radio wave sensing and identify their strengths and weaknesses under domain shifts.

Method: Five methods were evaluated: a rule-based connected component method, three traditional machine learning models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine), and a deep learning combination of convolutional neural network and long short term memory. Tests were conducted in two distinct indoor environments.

Result: The deep learning model achieved the highest accuracy in the same environment but struggled with domain shifts. Traditional machine learning models performed moderately, while the rule-based method was stable across environments. All models achieved high accuracy for binary detection of people presence.

Conclusion: High-capacity models provide detailed results in controlled settings but are susceptible to domain shifts. Rule-based models, while less granular, are robust to such shifts. A trade-off exists between spatial generalization and output granularity across all model types.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of rule-based methods, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in radio wave sensing with frequency modulated continuous wave multiple input multiple output radar. We systematically evaluated five approaches in two indoor environments with distinct layouts: a rule-based connected component method; three traditional machine learning models, namely k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine; and a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network and long short term memory. In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity.

### [270] [Bi-Erasing: A Bidirectional Framework for Concept Removal in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13039)
*Hao Chen,Yiwei Wang,Songze Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bi-Erasing, a method to simultaneously suppress harmful concepts and enhance safe ones in generative diffusion models, while improving balance between concept removal and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept removal methods in text-to-image diffusion models struggle to balance harmful concept suppression and generation quality, causing limitations in their effectiveness.

Method: The Bi-Erasing framework uses a pair of image branches: one suppresses harmful semantics (negative branch), while the other enhances safe alternatives (positive branch). Mask-based filtering is applied to prevent interference from irrelevant content.

Result: Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in concept removal efficacy and visual fidelity, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Bi-Erasing provides an effective solution to balance concept erasure with generation quality, making it promising for safer text-to-image generation models.

Abstract: Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.

*Tong Wei,Yijun Yang,Changhao Zhang,Junliang Xing,Yuanchun Shi,Zongqing Lu,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTR-Turbo improves multi-turn RL for vision-language models by eliminating dependency on costly teacher models while enhancing training stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RL methods like GTR are limited by reliance on expensive or privileged teacher models for densifying rewards and providing feedback.

Method: GTR-Turbo creates a 'free' teacher by merging weights of checkpoints produced during RL training, enabling effective guided training without external teacher models.

Result: Achieves 10-30% accuracy improvements, reduces training time by 50%, and cuts compute cost by 60% compared to GTR.

Conclusion: GTR-Turbo offers a practical, efficient, and reproducible alternative to enhance vision-language agent performance in RL settings.

Abstract: Multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-modal agents built upon vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by sparse rewards and long-horizon credit assignment. Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a "free" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the "entropy collapse" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable. Across diverse visual agentic tasks, GTR-Turbo improves the accuracy of the baseline model by 10-30% while reducing wall-clock training time by 50% and compute cost by 60% relative to GTR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Place Recognition has improved with high-capacity models like DINOv2, but their computational costs limit practical use in constrained devices.

Method: An asymmetric VPR framework leverages a high-capacity model for gallery feature extraction offline and a lightweight query network for online processing, using a geographical memory bank for feature compatibility and embedding augmentation for the query network.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques in VPR.

Conclusion: The framework establishes an efficient solution for deploying VPR on resource-constrained devices, maintaining high performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has advanced significantly with high-capacity foundation models like DINOv2, achieving remarkable performance. Nonetheless, their substantial computational cost makes deployment on resource-constrained devices impractical. In this paper, we introduce an efficient asymmetric VPR framework that incorporates a high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction with a lightweight query network for online processing. A key challenge in this setting is ensuring compatibility between these heterogeneous networks, which conventional approaches address through computationally expensive k-NN-based compatible training. To overcome this, we propose a geographical memory bank that structures gallery features using geolocation metadata inherent in VPR databases, eliminating the need for exhaustive k-NN computations. Additionally, we introduce an implicit embedding augmentation technique that enhances the query network to model feature variations despite its limited capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces computational costs but also outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing a new aspect for VPR in resource-limited environments.

Motivation: The motivation is to enable multimodal biomedical VLMs to effectively handle the challenges of preserving detailed intra-modality features while managing domain shifts in Continual Learning.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a multimodal RAG system for real-time knowledge retrieval and fine-tuning, complemented by a dynamic knowledge distillation framework that modulates knowledge granularity and importance as per the data's requirements.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated metrics under the rigorous Medical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark.

Conclusion: The introduced approach successfully resolves core challenges within Continual Learning for multimodal VLMs, achieving superior adaptation, retention, and learning capabilities, validated experimentally.

Abstract: Multimodal biomedical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit immense potential in the field of Continual Learning (CL). However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: Existing condensation methods produce datasets with significant redundancy and low diversity.

Method: Introducing Diversity Regularizer (DiRe), based on cosine similarity and Euclidean distance, applicable to various condensation methods.

Result: Improved condensation methods on benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K) with enhanced generalization and diversity.

Conclusion: The regularizer enhances the utility of condensation methods by reducing redundancy and boosting dataset diversity.

Abstract: In Dataset Condensation, the goal is to synthesize a small dataset that replicates the training utility of a large original dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniVCD, an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method employing pre-trained vision models (SAM2 and CLIP) to identify scene changes across diverse environments without relying on labeled data, demonstrating strong performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in supervised change detection methods, such as dependence on labeled datasets, high annotation costs, and poor generalization to diverse scenes.

Method: The researchers propose UniVCD, which combines frozen SAM2 and CLIP models through a feature alignment module and a post-processing pipeline, enabling category-agnostic and high-resolution change detection without labeled data or paired images.

Result: UniVCD demonstrated strong performance on public Binary Change Detection and Semantic Change Detection benchmarks, matching or surpassing existing open-vocabulary methods in F1 and IoU metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method highlights that using frozen vision foundation models with lightweight multi-modal alignment is effective for open-vocabulary, unsupervised change detection, offering a practical alternative to conventional supervised approaches.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) identifies scene changes from multi-temporal observations and is widely used in urban development and environmental monitoring. Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD. Code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/Die-Xie/UniVCD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADHint, which integrates reasoning trajectory hints with difficulty-aware adaptations for improved knowledge expansion and reasoning generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unstable learning and excessive imitation in existing hint-based RL methods by incorporating sample difficulty into hint scheduling and advantage estimation.

Method: The proposed ADHint approach involves adaptive hint scheduling based on sample difficulty, token-level gradient modulation to safeguard hints, and difficulty-based advantage estimation for balanced updates.

Result: Experimental results show that ADHint enhances reasoning abilities and generalization across various modalities and domains, outperforming existing methods in key metrics.

Conclusion: ADHint achieves better exploration-imitation trade-offs, delivering strong generalization and reasoning improvements compared to traditional hint-based RL approaches.

Abstract: To combine the advantages of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), recent methods have integrated ''hints'' into post-training, which are prefix segments of complete reasoning trajectories, aiming for powerful knowledge expansion and reasoning generalization. However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: The UnCoL framework improves medical image segmentation by combining general knowledge from foundation models and fine-grained task-specific learning, guided by uncertainty regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting issues with generalization in vision foundation models for specialized medical tasks, particularly with limited labels or rare pathologies.

Method: UnCoL uses a dual-teacher framework to combine general knowledge transfer and dynamic task-specific learning, regulated by pseudo-label uncertainty.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in 2D and 3D benchmarks, achieving near fully supervised performance with fewer annotations.

Conclusion: Balancing generalization and specialization with uncertainty-informed learning offers a robust way to address challenges in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Vision foundation models have demonstrated strong generalization in medical image segmentation by leveraging large-scale, heterogeneous pretraining. However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.

Conclusion: FID-Net effectively enables accurate detection of pest-affected trees and infestation pattern analysis, making it a valuable tool for intelligent monitoring, early warning systems, and targeted forest management to combat pest outbreaks.

Abstract: Forest pests threaten ecosystem stability, requiring efficient monitoring. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods in large-scale, fine-grained detection, this study focuses on accurately identifying infected trees and analyzing infestation patterns. We propose FID-Net, a deep learning model that detects pest-affected trees from UAV visible-light imagery and enables infestation analysis via three spatial metrics. Based on YOLOv8n, FID-Net introduces a lightweight Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) to extract disease-sensitive cues, an Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (AMFM) to align and fuse dual-branch features (RGB and FEM-enhanced), and an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism to enhance discriminative information efficiently. From detection results, we construct a pest situation analysis framework using: (1) Kernel Density Estimation to locate infection hotspots; (2) neighborhood evaluation to assess healthy trees' infection risk; (3) DBSCAN clustering to identify high-density healthy clusters as priority protection zones. Experiments on UAV imagery from 32 forest plots in eastern Tianshan, China, show that FID-Net achieves 86.10% precision, 75.44% recall, 82.29% mAP@0.5, and 64.30% mAP@0.5:0.95, outperforming mainstream YOLO models. Analysis confirms infected trees exhibit clear clustering, supporting targeted forest protection. FID-Net enables accurate tree health discrimination and, combined with spatial metrics, provides reliable data for intelligent pest monitoring, early warning, and precise management.

TL;DR: DiffFusion enhances multi-modal 3D object detection in adverse weather via diffusion-based restoration and adaptive fusion, achieving state-of-the-art robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multi-modal 3D object detection under harsh weather conditions caused by misalignment and data distortions.

Method: The DiffFusion framework uses diffusion models for denoising and provides modalities such as Diffusion-IR for image restoration, Point Cloud Restoration, and BAFAM for cross-modal alignment and fusion.

Result: DiffFusion outperforms existing methods in robustness under adverse weather on public datasets and shows strong generalization in zero-shot testing on the DENSE dataset.

Conclusion: DiffFusion advances reliable 3D object detection in adverse weather, ensuring robust and generalized performance, and will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source.

TL;DR: DePT3R is a novel framework for dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes in a single forward pass, requiring no camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current dense 3D point tracking methods that depend on camera poses or frame ordering, and to leverage opportunities for unified dynamic scene understanding.

Method: The method employs a multi-task learning framework using deep spatio-temporal features and dense prediction heads, achieving pixel-wise predictions without relying on camera poses.

Result: DePT3R demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks, improving memory efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DePT3R enhances flexibility and efficiency in dynamic scene analysis, presenting a significant advancement in dense 3D point tracking and reconstruction.

Abstract: Current methods for dense 3D point tracking in dynamic scenes typically rely on pairwise processing, require known camera poses, or assume a temporal ordering to input frames, constraining their flexibility and applicability. Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel leaf-tracking dataset, CanolaTrack, and a new model, LeafTrackNet, that achieves superior tracking performance in complex plant phenotyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution phenotyping is underutilized due to the lack of robust leaf tracking methods, especially for complex crops like canola, and the absence of large datasets under realistic conditions.

Method: The study presents CanolaTrack, a dataset of 5,704 RGB images and 31,840 annotated leaf instances, and proposes LeafTrackNet, a framework combining YOLOv10 for detection and MobileNetV3 for embedding with memory association for identity maintenance.

Result: LeafTrackNet outperformed existing plant-specific and MOT trackers, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on the CanolaTrack dataset.

Conclusion: This work sets a new benchmark for leaf-level tracking, introducing CanolaTrack as the largest dataset for agricultural leaf tracking, and provides tools to advance future plant phenotyping research.

Abstract: High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/shl-shawn/LeafTrackNet.

*Chun Kit Wong,Paraskevas Pegios,Nina Weng,Emilie Pi Fogtmann Sejer,Martin Grønnebæk Tolsgaard,Anders Nymark Christensen,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Weight Space Correlation Analysis, a method to verify that deep learning models in medical imaging rely on clinically relevant factors, rather than confounding metadata, for predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often depend on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) rather than clinically relevant signals. There is a need to determine whether models genuinely utilize clinical information for their predictions.

Method: The paper introduces Weight Space Correlation Analysis, a technique that measures the alignment between classification heads for clinical tasks and auxiliary metadata tasks, enabling the quantification of feature utilization.

Result: The method was validated by detecting artificial shortcut learning. Applied to a preterm birth prediction model, it revealed that the model's weight vectors were aligned with clinically relevant factors rather than irrelevant metadata.

Conclusion: The methodology enables the verification of model trustworthiness by ensuring models focus on genuine clinical signals and not irrelevant metadata, fostering confidence in their predictions.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.

### [283] [StarryGazer: Leveraging Monocular Depth Estimation Models for Domain-Agnostic Single Depth Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13147)
*Sangmin Hong,Suyoung Lee,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StarryGazer is a framework for depth completion, predicting dense depth images from sparse depth maps and RGB images without relying on ground truth depth, leveraging large monocular depth estimation (MDE) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth completion is essential for dense depth prediction from sparse inputs where ground truth data is unavailable. Current unsupervised methods require auxiliary data and fail to combine sparse depth with MDE effectively.

Method: The framework uses pre-trained MDE models for relative depth images, segments, and rescales these into synthetic pairs for pseudo-ground truth. A refinement network is trained using these pairs with depth maps and RGB images to enhance accuracy.

Result: StarryGazer outperforms existing unsupervised depth completion methods and better utilizes MDE models across different datasets.

Conclusion: StarryGazer successfully predicts dense depth images in a domain-agnostic manner, effectively leveraging MDE models and sparse depth information to improve unsupervised depth completion results.

Abstract: The problem of depth completion involves predicting a dense depth image from a single sparse depth map and an RGB image. Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information.

*Peter Kocsis,Lukas Höllein,Matthias Nießner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Intrinsic Image Fusion, a novel method to reconstruct high-quality materials from multi-view images by addressing the challenges of material reconstruction through diffusion-based estimators, soft prediction selection, and optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of material reconstruction from multi-view images, which is highly underconstrained and typically relies on computationally expensive path tracing, by incorporating single-view priors and reducing multi-view inconsistencies.

Method: The authors leverage a diffusion-based material estimator for single-view predictions, fit a low-dimensional parametric function to reduce inconsistencies, and develop a robust optimization framework for selecting and fusing consistent multi-view predictions. Inverse path tracing is used for final parameter optimization.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in material disentanglement across synthetic and real scenes, achieving sharp and clean reconstructions fit for high-quality relighting.

Conclusion: Intrinsic Image Fusion advances the field of material reconstruction by introducing a more constrained and efficient framework that integrates predictions from multiple views while producing high-quality results suitable for practical applications like relighting.

Abstract: We introduce Intrinsic Image Fusion, a method that reconstructs high-quality physically based materials from multi-view images. Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in material disentanglement on both synthetic and real scenes, producing sharp and clean reconstructions suitable for high-quality relighting.

Result: The model generates diverse pathological images validated by metrics and expert evaluations, enhances performance in various clinical tasks, and provides controllable tissue architecture synthesis using ControlNet.

Conclusion: CRAFTS overcomes data scarcity and privacy challenges, enabling high-quality histology data generation to aid in developing diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancers.

Abstract: The development of clinical-grade artificial intelligence in pathology is limited by the scarcity of diverse, high-quality annotated datasets. Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.

*Hongxuan Sun,Tao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFSS, a novel semantic segmentation framework for data-free knowledge distillation, addressing continuity limitations in existing methods, and showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFKD methods perform poorly on semantic segmentation tasks due to neglect of spatial and structural continuity of objects.

Method: DFSS leverages Batch Normalization statistics for Approximate Distribution Sampling and proposes Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation for training, respecting structural continuity.

Result: DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free methods for semantic segmentation in various benchmarks.

Conclusion: DFSS demonstrates state-of-the-art results in data-free distillation for semantic segmentation, maintaining structural and contextual integrity without auxiliary data.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation requires a holistic understanding of the physical world, as it assigns semantic labels to spatially continuous and structurally coherent objects rather than to isolated pixels. However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data.

*Gong Chen,Chaokun Zhang,Pengcheng Lv,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRA, a hybrid collaborative perception method integrating intermediate and late fusion to address communication challenges, achieving high robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation of state-of-the-art intermediate fusion methods under adverse communication conditions in collaborative perception, which restricts their practical deployment.

Method: The proposed method, CoRA, integrates a hybrid approach by combining a feature-level fusion branch for performance and scalability and an object-level correction branch for robustness against pose errors.

Result: CoRA delivers a significant 19% improvement in AP@0.7 under challenging scenarios while reducing communication volume by over 5x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that CoRA is an effective and efficient solution for robust collaborative perception, coupling strength from different fusion paradigms.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention as a crucial technology to overcome the perceptual limitations of single-agent systems. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in face relighting has been limited due to the scarcity of large-scale, physically consistent illumination datasets.

Method: The authors introduce POLAR, a dataset with 200+ subjects captured under varying conditions, and POLARNet, a flow-based generative model that predicts per-light responses for realistic relighting.

Result: POLAR provides comprehensive illumination data, and POLARNet achieves direction-aware, fine-grained portrait relighting that preserves identity and geometry.

Conclusion: POLAR and POLARNet establish a unified framework for scalable, reproducible, and physically grounded portrait illumination learning.

Abstract: Face relighting aims to synthesize realistic portraits under novel illumination while preserving identity and geometry. However, progress remains constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. To address this, we introduce POLAR, a large-scale and physically calibrated One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) dataset containing over 200 subjects captured under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and diverse expressions. Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining "chicken-and-egg" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination.

Motivation: To provide a high-quality dataset that supports advanced research and development of egocentric video-language assistants for expert-level guidance in procedural activities.

Method: Utilized a novel “Wizard of OZ” data collection paradigm where experts acted as intelligent assistants providing real-time feedback during trainee actions, collecting 50 hours of dialogue-rich egocentric videos.

Result: Created a benchmark of over 15k Visual Question Answer pairs used to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models, revealing both their capabilities and limitations in aiding expert-level assistance.

Conclusion: Ego-EXTRA is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating egocentric video-language assistants, highlighting gaps in current multimodal models and fostering future improvements.

Abstract: We present Ego-EXTRA, a video-language Egocentric Dataset for EXpert-TRAinee assistance. Ego-EXTRA features 50 hours of unscripted egocentric videos of subjects performing procedural activities (the trainees) while guided by real-world experts who provide guidance and answer specific questions using natural language. Following a ``Wizard of OZ'' data collection paradigm, the expert enacts a wearable intelligent assistant, looking at the activities performed by the trainee exclusively from their egocentric point of view, answering questions when asked by the trainee, or proactively interacting with suggestions during the procedures. This unique data collection protocol enables Ego-EXTRA to capture a high-quality dialogue in which expert-level feedback is provided to the trainee. Two-way dialogues between experts and trainees are recorded, transcribed, and used to create a novel benchmark comprising more than 15k high-quality Visual Question Answer sets, which we use to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models. The results show that Ego-EXTRA is challenging and highlight the limitations of current models when used to provide expert-level assistance to the user.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARCaster presents a unified video diffusion model for speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint synthesis, introducing softer identity constraints and implicit 3D awareness in the 2D domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speech-to-video and 3D animation face limitations like motion diversity and identity drift, prompting a rethink of current paradigms for improved synthesis.

Method: The model leverages ID-aware motion modeling, lip reading-based supervision, and a temporal-to-spatial adaptation approach. Training decouples view consistency from temporal coherence and employs a self-forcing scheme for enhanced temporal context learning.

Result: STARCaster outperforms previous approaches in benchmarks, successfully generalizing across multiple tasks and identities.

Conclusion: STARCaster offers improved animation with increased motion diversity, identity preservation, and effective generalization, marking a significant advancement over traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visually Grounded Active View Selection (VG-AVS) task to improve embodied agents' ability to select informative viewpoints during visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable embodied agents to actively select informative views for visual question answering, moving beyond snapshot-based reasoning tied to static images.

Method: The authors propose VG-AVS task and construct a synthetic dataset. They fine-tune pretrained Vision Language Models via supervised fine-tuning and RL-based policy optimization.

Result: Their approach achieves strong question-answering accuracy, generalizes well to synthetic and real scenes, and improves performance when integrated into existing exploration-based embodied question answering systems.

Conclusion: VG-AVS enhances embodied agents by empowering them to identify the most informative next viewpoints, improving visual question answering accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual question answering (VQA) but remain limited to snapshot vision, reasoning from static images. In contrast, embodied agents require ambulatory vision, actively moving to obtain more informative views. We introduce Visually Grounded Active View Selection (VG-AVS), a task that selects the most informative next viewpoint using only the visual information in the current image, without relying on scene memory or external knowledge. To support this task, we construct a synthetic dataset with automatically generated paired query-target views and question-answer prompts. We also propose a framework that fine-tunes pretrained VLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL-based policy optimization. Our approach achieves strong question answering performance based on viewpoint selection and generalizes robustly to unseen synthetic and real scenes. Furthermore, incorporating our learned VG-AVS framework into existing scene-exploration-based EQA systems improves downstream question-answering accuracy.

TL;DR: CogniEdit enables fine-grained image editing using diffusion models with precise control over attributes like colors, positions, and quantities by leveraging a combination of multi-modal inputs and dense reward optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing methods in handling fine-grained instructions and achieving trajectory-level control in instruction-based image editing.

Method: The paper proposes a unified framework named CogniEdit, integrating large multimodal models for instruction decomposition, dynamic token focus relocation for fine-grained attention, and Dense GRPO-based optimization for gradient propagation across denoising steps.

Result: CogniEdit outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets by effectively balancing fine-grained instruction adherence, visual quality, and preserving editability.

Conclusion: Through innovative methodologies, CogniEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance in enabling fine-grained control in image editing tasks.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing with diffusion models has achieved impressive results, yet existing methods struggle with fine-grained instructions specifying precise attributes such as colors, positions, and quantities. While recent approaches employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for alignment, they optimize only at individual sampling steps, providing sparse feedback that limits trajectory-level control. We propose a unified framework CogniEdit, combining multi-modal reasoning with dense reward optimization that propagates gradients across consecutive denoising steps, enabling trajectory-level gradient flow through the sampling process. Our method comprises three components: (1) Multi-modal Large Language Models for decomposing complex instructions into actionable directives, (2) Dynamic Token Focus Relocation that adaptively emphasizes fine-grained attributes, and (3) Dense GRPO-based optimization that propagates gradients across consecutive steps for trajectory-level supervision.

*Jiaqi Wang,Weijia Wu,Yi Zhan,Rui Zhao,Ming Hu,James Cheng,Wei Liu,Philip Torr,Kevin Qinghong Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark called Video Reality Test to assess the realism of AI-generated videos paired with audio, specifically focused on ASMR content. Results highlight the limitations of both video generation and VLMs in distinguishing real from fake videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing capability of AI in generating realistic videos poses societal challenges, especially when these videos can deceive both humans and advanced models. Current benchmarks have gaps, such as including audio and testing tight audio-visual coupling, which this study aims to address.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark featuring curated ASMR videos and an adversarial peer-review evaluation protocol where video generation models and vision-language models (VLMs) act as creators and reviewers, respectively.

Result: Experimental results show that the best video generator (Veo3.1-Fast) can deceive even the strongest VLM reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) with a mere 56% accuracy. Humans outperform models with 81.25% accuracy. Adding audio improves model performance but does not fully resolve deception.

Conclusion: This work underscores the progress in video generation realism while exposing the current limitations of VLMs in detecting fake videos, emphasizing the need for improved methods to address audio-visual consistency and perceptual fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\% accuracy (random 50\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency.

### [294] [CausalCLIP: Causally-Informed Feature Disentanglement and Filtering for Generalizable Detection of Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13285)
*Bo Liu,Qiao Qin,Qinghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CausalCLIP, a method to improve generalization in detecting generated images by disentangling causal and non-causal features, achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust detectors that generalize across diverse generated image techniques due to limitations in current methods that mix relevant forensic cues with irrelevant patterns.

Method: CausalCLIP leverages causal inference principles, feature masking, and statistical independence constraints to isolate stable causal features using structural causal models.

Result: CausalCLIP significantly improves generalization to unseen generative models, achieving notable increases in accuracy (6.83%) and average precision (4.06%) over existing methods.

Conclusion: Explicit disentanglement of causal from non-causal features enhances the robustness and transferability of generated image detectors, addressing generalization challenges in evolving techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has increased the demand for generated image detectors capable of generalizing across diverse and evolving generation techniques. However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods.

*Shu Yu,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of physical alignment and out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following in diffusion models (DMs) by introducing a novel method called LINA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the difficulties in diffusion models with physical alignment and their inability to follow instructions for out-of-distribution scenarios, attributed to a lack of understanding of causal directions and factors.

Method: The proposed method includes introducing the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset for diagnostics, and LINA framework designed with prompt-specific interventions, targeted guidance, and a causality-aware denoising schedule.

Result: The proposed LINA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks, including the Winoground dataset.

Conclusion: LINA demonstrates improved capabilities in physical alignment and OOD instruction-following by leveraging causal structure-based interventions in diffusion models, marking a significant advancement in image and video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

Conclusion: ShowTable is an effective approach for creative table visualization tasks, achieving high-fidelity results through advanced multi-modal processes and setting a new standard with the benchmark TableVisBench.

Abstract: While existing generation and unified models excel at general image generation, they struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning, planning, and precise data-to-visual mapping abilities beyond general scenarios. To push beyond the existing limitations, we introduce a new and challenging task: creative table visualization, requiring the model to generate an infographic that faithfully and aesthetically visualizes the data from a given table. To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results. To support this task and our pipeline, we introduce three automated data construction pipelines for training different modules. Furthermore, we introduce TableVisBench, a new benchmark with 800 challenging instances across 5 evaluation dimensions, to assess performance on this task. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline, instantiated with different models, significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effective multi-modal reasoning, generation, and error correction capabilities.

TL;DR: KlingAvatar 2.0 is a model for generating long-duration, high-resolution avatar videos. It overcomes challenges like temporal drifting, quality loss, and weak prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in efficiency, quality, and alignment experienced in prior avatar video generation when handling long-duration and high-resolution videos.

Method: KlingAvatar 2.0 employs a spatio-temporal cascade framework for upscaling resolution and temporal coherence. It uses blueprint video keyframes and a first-last frame strategy for smooth transitions. The Co-Reasoning Director and Negative Director enhance cross-modal alignment and instruction precision.

Result: The model achieves high visual clarity, lip synchronization, identity preservation, and follows multimodal instructions effectively even in extended videos.

Conclusion: KlingAvatar 2.0 successfully improves the quality, coherence, and cross-modal alignment in long-duration avatar video generation, setting a new benchmark in the area.

Abstract: Avatar video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.

### [298] [Face Identity Unlearning for Retrieval via Embedding Dispersion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13317)
*Mikhail Zakharov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses face identity unlearning for retrieval systems to ensure unretrievable identities while maintaining performance for others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses privacy concerns in face recognition systems, where unauthorized tracking of identities is possible.

Method: Evaluates existing unlearning techniques and proposes a dispersion-based unlearning method for face retrieval systems.

Result: Experiments on VGGFace2 and CelebA benchmarks show the proposed method effectively balances identity forgetting with retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully achieves privacy protection by dispersing embeddings, making selected identities unretrievable without compromising system performance.

Abstract: Face recognition systems rely on learning highly discriminative and compact identity clusters to enable accurate retrieval. However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving object detection performance on long-tailed datasets using enhanced Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) and metric learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inherent class imbalance issue in real-world, long-tailed datasets, which biases models and lowers performance on rare classes.

Method: The authors utilize a Faster R-CNN architecture, improve the Balanced Group Softmax framework, integrate metric learning, and adopt a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique for better classification.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a new state-of-the-art mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5% on the LVISv1 dataset, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that enhancing BAGS, leveraging metric learning, and using k-NN inference significantly improve object detection performance, especially for tail classes in long-tailed distributions.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework leveraging DINO self-attention key features and a convolutional decoder for improved polyp segmentation in colorectal cancer, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of generalization and complexity in current polyp segmentation techniques, especially under challenging or data-constrained conditions.

Method: A novel approach using DINO's self-attention key features coupled with a simple convolutional decoder for polyp mask prediction, validated under Domain Generalization and Extreme Single Domain Generalization protocols.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net, while showing improved generalization in difficult scenarios.

Conclusion: The presented framework effectively enhances robustness, generalization, and simplicity in polyp segmentation without relying on task-specific architectures, offering a benchmark for future evaluations.

Abstract: Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for improving the clinical identification of colorectal cancer (CRC). While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention "key" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance.

*Anran Qi,Changjian Li,Adrien Bousseau,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel image-to-video generation method with explicit user control over disoccluded regions, combining a Proxy Dynamic Graph for motion and a diffusion prior for appearance synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-video methods lack precise and predictable control for user-specified motion and appearance in previously hidden regions of the final frame.

Method: The method separates motion from appearance by using a Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) for user-editable motion and a frozen diffusion model for synthesizing appearance. Users annotate and repose the PDG, enabling guided articulation and editing of disoccluded areas.

Result: The proposed pipeline demonstrates improved articulation control and user direction over the appearance of disoccluded regions compared to current state-of-the-art solutions across various object types.

Conclusion: The approach opens possibilities for enhanced user-guided image-to-video transformation workflows and overcomes limitations of existing techniques without the need for fine-tuning.

Abstract: We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow. Code will be released on acceptance. Project page: https://anranqi.github.io/beyondvisible.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces refinement Neural Cellular Automata (rNCA) as a method to repair topological flaws in segmentation masks, improving results across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs requiring manual correction methods or task-specific solutions. A general, adaptive solution to ensure topologically correct segmentation results is needed.

Method: The authors propose using Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) as a refinement mechanism. By training rNCA on imperfect masks and their ground truths, the model learns target structural properties and uses local, iterative updates to repair outputs progressively.

Result: Refinement NCA yields improved segmentation results: for retinal vessels, it increases Dice scores by 2-3%, reduces $β_0$ errors by 60%, and $β_1$ errors by 20%; for myocardium segmentation, it resolves 61.5% of broken cases and reduces ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively.

Conclusion: Refinement NCA is an effective, general-purpose tool for repairing segmentation mask errors, suitable for diverse applications and improving topological consistency without task-specific adjustments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting topologically correct masks remains a difficult task for general segmentation models, which often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs. Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners.

Abstract: Purpose: Intraoperative navigation in spine surgery demands millimeter-level accuracy. Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive. Recent markerless RGB-D registration methods offer a promising alternative, but existing approaches rely on weak segmentation labels to isolate relevant anatomical structures, which can propagate errors throughout registration. Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision. Results: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ex- and in-vivo benchmarks, reducing median Target Registration Error by 32% to 1.83mm and mean Root Mean Square Error by 45% to 3.95mm, respectively. An ablation study confirms that end-to-end optimization significantly improves registration accuracy.

Motivation: To address issues of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery and the challenges of labor-intensive manual annotation.

Result: A hybrid training strategy that combines real and synthetic data optimized detection and segmentation performance in object detection models like YOLO.

Conclusion: The approach offers an efficient way to develop robust and accurate computer vision models by combining synthetic and real-world data effectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel pipeline for generating large-scale, highly realistic, and automatically labeled datasets for computer vision tasks in robotic environments. Our approach addresses the critical challenges of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery and the time-consuming bottleneck of manual annotation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create photorealistic representations of the operational environment and objects. These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism. Pixel-perfect segmentation masks are generated automatically and formatted for direct use with object detection models like YOLO. Our experiments show that a hybrid training strategy, combining a small set of real images with a large volume of our synthetic data, yields the best detection and segmentation performance, confirming this as an optimal strategy for efficiently achieving robust and accurate models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSLR methods fail to effectively capture fine-grained spatial cues like hand/facial gestures and long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: USTM employs a Swin Transformer backbone with a lightweight temporal adapter that integrates positional embeddings, enabling both spatial and temporal modeling.

Result: USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily datasets, outperforming RGB-based and multi-modal CSLR techniques.

Conclusion: USTM demonstrates effective and robust sign language recognition, combining fine-grained spatial and temporal context modeling. The framework is a step forward in CSLR, with competitive performance against more complex multi-stream approaches.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) requires precise spatio-temporal modeling to accurately recognize sequences of gestures in videos. Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM

Conclusion: MCT-UEG is an impactful innovation in enhancing personal data privacy, creating more effective and broadly applicable unexploitable image examples.

Abstract: Unexploitable example generation aims to transform personal images into their unexploitable (unlearnable) versions before they are uploaded online, thereby preventing unauthorized exploitation of online personal images. Recently, this task has garnered significant research attention due to its critical relevance to personal data privacy. Yet, despite recent progress, existing methods for this task can still suffer from limited practical applicability, as they can fail to generate examples that are broadly unexploitable across different real-world computer vision tasks. To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose a novel Meta Cross-Task Unexploitable Example Generation (MCT-UEG) framework. At the core of our framework, to optimize the unexploitable example generator for effectively producing broadly unexploitable examples, we design a flat-minima-oriented meta training and testing scheme. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework.

*Qingyu Shi,Size Wu,Jinbin Bai,Kaidong Yu,Yujing Wang,Yunhai Tong,Xiangtai Li,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RecTok, a novel method enhancing high-dimensional visual tokenizers through semantic distillation and reconstruction-alignment techniques for diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual tokenizers in diffusion models face challenges due to a trade-off between dimensionality and generation quality, limiting performance in high-dimensional latent spaces.

Method: RecTok introduces flow semantic distillation to enrich semantic information in forward flow trajectories, and reconstruction-alignment distillation through masked feature reconstruction loss.

Result: RecTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction, generation quality, discriminative ability, and improves consistency with increasing latent dimensionality.

Conclusion: RecTok overcomes limitations of high-dimensional tokenizers, maintaining semantic richness and achieving superior results, enhancing performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method, MineTheGap, to detect and measure biases in Text-to-Image models using prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases in Text-to-Image models that lead to societal impacts and limit generated image diversity.

Method: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to find prompts exposing bias, guided by a novel bias score comparing image distribution to LLM-generated text variations.

Result: MineTheGap successfully identifies biases in TTI models using a validated bias scoring mechanism.

Conclusion: MineTheGap enhances bias detection in TTI models, providing a tool to understand and mitigate biases for ethical and diverse image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models generate images based on text prompts, which often leave certain aspects of the desired image ambiguous. When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations. These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight few-shot learning framework for plant leaf disease detection using MobileNet models and a Bi-LSTM classifier with attention, showing high accuracy and efficiency in both laboratory and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate plant disease identification in data-scarce and resource-constrained environments motivated the researchers to develop an efficient and scalable model.

Method: The approach uses MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 for feature extraction, a feature fusion technique, and a Bi-LSTM classifier with attention for optimal disease classification.

Result: The framework demonstrated competitive performance across various datasets, including achieving 99.72% accuracy on PlantVillage with 15-shot learning and maintaining high resilience in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides scalable, mobile-friendly, and efficient plant disease diagnostics suitable for deployment in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of plant leaf diseases is essential for resilient and sustainable agriculture, yet most deep learning approaches rely on large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning. With a compact model size of approximately 40 MB and inference complexity of approximately 1.12 GFLOPs, this work establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMILIA, a system for analyzing inflammation in IBD tissue slides using AI. It predicts inflammation and provides interpretability by identifying relevant tissue and cell markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing microscopic inflammation accurately is critical for evaluating disease activity and treatment response in IBD as the focus shifts to histologic remission.

Method: The framework integrates a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model for inflammation prediction and an interpretability module with HistoPLUS (cell detection and classification) and EpiSeg (epithelium segmentation).

Result: IMILIA achieved a ROC-AUC of up to 0.99 on validation datasets and demonstrated biologically consistent patterns, such as correlating high immune cell densities with inflammation.

Conclusion: IMILIA provides accurate inflammation assessment and interpretable biological insights, making it a valuable tool for IBD analysis. The methods and code are partially available for replication.

Abstract: As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.

*Arpit Jadon,Joshua Niemeijer,Yuki M. Asano*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a test-time use of diffusion models to align target domain images with the source domain, simplifying domain generalization tasks and removing dependency on large-scale synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative foundation models are promising for domain generalization tasks but synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations during training is costly and inefficient.

Method: The paper uses diffusion models during test time to map target images back to the source domain where the downstream model was trained.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvements in segmentation, detection, and classification under challenging domain shifts with significant gains across datasets such as BDD100K-Night, ImageNet-R, and DarkZurich.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical and efficient alternative for domain generalization by leveraging source domain descriptions and diffusion models, yielding robust performance improvements.

Abstract: Generative foundation models contain broad visual knowledge and can produce diverse image variations, making them particularly promising for advancing domain generalization tasks. While they can be used for training data augmentation, synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations remains slow, expensive, and incomplete. We propose an alternative: using diffusion models at test time to map target images back to the source distribution where the downstream model was trained. This approach requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. We demonstrate consistent improvements across segmentation, detection, and classification tasks under challenging environmental shifts in real-to-real domain generalization scenarios with unknown target distributions. Our analysis spans multiple generative and downstream models, including an ensemble variant for enhanced robustness. The method achieves substantial relative gains: 137% on BDD100K-Night, 68% on ImageNet-R, and 62% on DarkZurich.

*Ruiyan Wang,Teng Hu,Kaihui Huang,Zihan Su,Ran Yi,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoseAnything, a universal pose-guided video generation framework supporting both human and non-human characters with improved consistency and independent camera motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-guided video methods are limited to human poses and lack generalization to non-human subjects.

Method: The authors introduce PoseAnything with a Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module for fine-grained consistency and a Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG for independent camera movement control.

Result: PoseAnything outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PoseAnything provides a universal solution for pose-guided video generation with enhanced generalization, consistency, and camera motion control.

Abstract: Pose-guided video generation refers to controlling the motion of subjects in generated video through a sequence of poses. It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Transformer strategy, T3-Video, to efficiently generate native 4K videos, balancing compute efficiency and video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating native 4K videos is computationally challenging due to the high demands of full-attention models; optimizing this process without compromising quality is essential.

Method: T3-Video employs a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism with hierarchical blocking and axis-preserving full-attention design to retrofit pretrained full-attention models efficiently.

Result: T3-Video outperforms existing methods with +4.29 VQA and +0.08 VTC improvements while accelerating 4K video generation by over 10×.

Conclusion: T3-Video is a robust approach for computationally efficient and high-quality 4K video generation, offering significant advancements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Native 4K (2160$\times$3840) video generation remains a critical challenge due to the quadratic computational explosion of full-attention as spatiotemporal resolution increases, making it difficult for models to strike a balance between efficiency and quality. This paper proposes a novel Transformer retrofit strategy termed $\textbf{T3}$ ($\textbf{T}$ransform $\textbf{T}$rained $\textbf{T}$ransformer) that, without altering the core architecture of full-attention pretrained models, significantly reduces compute requirements by optimizing their forward logic. Specifically, $\textbf{T3-Video}$ introduces a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism and, via hierarchical blocking together with an axis-preserving full-attention design, can effect an "attention pattern" transformation of a pretrained model using only modest compute and data. Results on 4K-VBench show that $\textbf{T3-Video}$ substantially outperforms existing approaches: while delivering performance improvements (+4.29$\uparrow$ VQA and +0.08$\uparrow$ VTC), it accelerates native 4K video generation by more than 10$\times$.

Conclusion: Soul provides a robust solution for creating semantically coherent high-fidelity human animations, with potential applications in virtual anchors and film production.

Abstract: We propose a multimodal-driven framework for high-fidelity long-term digital human animation termed $\textbf{Soul}$, which generates semantically coherent videos from a single-frame portrait image, text prompts, and audio, achieving precise lip synchronization, vivid facial expressions, and robust identity preservation. We construct Soul-1M, containing 1 million finely annotated samples with a precise automated annotation pipeline (covering portrait, upper-body, full-body, and multi-person scenes) to mitigate data scarcity, and we carefully curate Soul-Bench for comprehensive and fair evaluation of audio-/text-guided animation methods. The model is built on the Wan2.2-5B backbone, integrating audio-injection layers and multiple training strategies together with threshold-aware codebook replacement to ensure long-term generation consistency. Meanwhile, step/CFG distillation and a lightweight VAE are used to optimize inference efficiency, achieving an 11.4$\times$ speedup with negligible quality loss. Extensive experiments show that Soul significantly outperforms current leading open-source and commercial models on video quality, video-text alignment, identity preservation, and lip-synchronization accuracy, demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios such as virtual anchors and film production.

TL;DR: TARA is a time-aware video-text embedding model adapted without using video data, outperforming others on the created benchmark for chiral actions and offering robust zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation in existing video-text retrieval models by introducing time-awareness using an efficient method.

Method: TARA adapts Multimodal LLMs into time-aware video-text embeddings without requiring video data and proposes a benchmark to test temporally opposite actions.

Result: TARA achieves superior performance over existing video-text retrieval models on chiral benchmarks, NegBench, and standard evaluations.

Conclusion: TARA provides a versatile, efficient, and time-aware embedding model excelling in retrieval tasks, negation-awareness, and understanding verbs and adverbs in videos.

Abstract: Our objective is to build a general time-aware video-text embedding model for retrieval. To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Pancakes,' a framework for multi-label biomedical image segmentation based on multiple plausible protocols, outperforming existing foundation models in semantic coherence and segmentation versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models are constrained, focusing on single protocols or requiring extensive manual input for multi-protocol outputs. There is a need for an automated solution capable of handling multiple segmentation protocols efficiently.

Method: The authors developed Pancakes, a framework that processes previously unseen domain images and generates protocol-specific, multi-label segmentation maps while preserving semantic consistency across images.

Result: Experiments conducted on seven datasets show that Pancakes outperforms current foundation models, achieving coherent and plausible segmentations for whole images across multiple protocols.

Conclusion: Pancakes successfully addresses limitations of current models by introducing a versatile framework for multi-label segmentation, setting a new benchmark for semantic consistency and multi-protocol usability in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: A single biomedical image can be meaningfully segmented in multiple ways, depending on the desired application. For instance, a brain MRI can be segmented according to tissue types, vascular territories, broad anatomical regions, fine-grained anatomy, or pathology, etc. Existing automatic segmentation models typically either (1) support only a single protocol, the one they were trained on, or (2) require labor-intensive manual prompting to specify the desired segmentation. We introduce Pancakes, a framework that, given a new image from a previously unseen domain, automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols, while maintaining semantic consistency across related images. Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses detecting anomalies in human-human interactions and proposes a novel network model (IADNet) to improve accuracy in identifying these anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for anomaly detection mainly focus on individual behaviors, neglecting the complexity and dynamics of collaborative human interactions.

Method: The paper introduces IADNet, featuring a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM) for synchronized motion correlations and a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to capture spatial social cues, alongside a normalizing flow for anomaly scoring.

Result: IADNet significantly outperformed existing single-person anomaly detection models on benchmarks designed for human-human interaction anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising approach to detect interactive human behavior anomalies, marking an advancement in the anomaly detection field.

Abstract: Human-centric anomaly detection (AD) has been primarily studied to specify anomalous behaviors in a single person. However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMhops, a benchmark for evaluating multi-modal multi-hop reasoning, alongside MMhops-R1, a robust model for dynamic reasoning, outperforming competing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-modal Large Language Models struggle with multi-step reasoning due to insufficient benchmarks.

Method: The paper proposes MMhops, a new benchmark with two task formats, and MMhops-R1, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework optimized using reinforcement learning.

Result: MMhops-R1 surpasses baselines in complex reasoning tasks and generalizes to fixed-hop reasoning challenges.

Conclusion: The paper presents a groundbreaking benchmark and innovative model, releasing resources to advance research in multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach.

### [321] [Lighting in Motion: Spatiotemporal HDR Lighting Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13597)
*Christophe Bolduc,Julien Philip,Li Ma,Mingming He,Paul Debevec,Jean-François Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lighting in Motion (LiMo), a diffusion-based model for realistic and precise spatiotemporal lighting estimation, leveraging diffusion priors and geometric conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatiotemporal lighting estimation by addressing challenges in achieving both high-frequency realism and accurate illuminance prediction.

Method: The authors utilize diffusion priors, fine-tune models on a custom dataset with light probes, and propose a novel geometric condition for spatial accuracy. They merge diffuse and mirrored sphere predictions into a high-dynamic-range image (HDRI) map using differentiable rendering.

Result: LiMo achieves superior accuracy and control in lighting estimation, surpassing existing methods in both spatial precision and illumination prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: LiMo sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark for spatiotemporal lighting estimation, effectively balancing realism and accuracy by combining innovative methods and precise geometric conditioning.

Abstract: We present Lighting in Motion (LiMo), a diffusion-based approach to spatiotemporal lighting estimation. LiMo targets both realistic high-frequency detail prediction and accurate illuminance estimation. To account for both, we propose generating a set of mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures, based on their 3D positions in the input. Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes. For accurate spatial conditioning, we demonstrate that depth alone is insufficient and we introduce a new geometric condition to provide the relative position of the scene to the target 3D position. Finally, we combine diffuse and mirror predictions at different exposures into a single HDRI map leveraging differentiable rendering. We thoroughly evaluate our method and design choices to establish LiMo as state-of-the-art for both spatial control and prediction accuracy.

*Haoyue Zhang,Meera Chappidi,Erolcan Sayar,Helen Richards,Zhijun Chen,Lucas Liu,Roxanne Wadia,Peter A Humphrey,Fady Ghali,Alberto Contreras-Sanz,Peter Black,Jonathan Wright,Stephanie Harmon,Michael Haffner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces DA-SSL, a lightweight domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor, to improve pathology foundational models (PFMs) performance for histopathology tasks where domain shifts occur, specifically focusing on TURBT tissue data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology foundational models underperform on domain-shifted specimen types like TURBT due to fragmented tissue artifacts and lack of inclusion in pretraining datasets. These limitations hinder their ability to predict treatment responses effectively.

Method: A domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) was designed to realign pretrained PFM features to domain-specific data, such as TURBT, without altering the foundational model itself. This method was applied for treatment response prediction tasks.

Result: DA-SSL achieved strong predictive performance in a multi-center study with AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and external test metrics of 0.84 accuracy, 0.71 sensitivity, and 0.91 specificity using majority voting.

Conclusion: The DA-SSL method successfully enhanced PFM-based MIL frameworks for TURBT histopathology tasks, demonstrating the potential for lightweight domain adaptation in addressing complex clinical challenges.

Abstract: Recent deep learning frameworks in histopathology, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL) combined with pathology foundational models (PFMs), have shown strong performance. However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVie 2 is an autoregressive video world model framework focused on controllability, visual quality, and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive video world model capable of long-term controllability, high-quality visuals, and temporal coherence.

Method: The study introduces LongVie 2, trained in three stages: multi-modal guidance for better controllability, degradation-aware training for visual quality, and history-context guidance for temporal consistency.

Result: LongVie 2 delivers state-of-the-art results across long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, with the capability of generating up to five-minute continuous videos.

Conclusion: LongVie 2 marks a significant advancement toward unified video world modeling with robust spatiotemporal capabilities.

Abstract: Building video world models upon pretrained video generation systems represents an important yet challenging step toward general spatiotemporal intelligence. A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), and evaluates its performance across three medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of foundation models for three-dimensional imaging modalities like DBT, despite their importance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The authors focus on leveraging domain-specific data and pre-training to improve medical imaging.

Method: The authors used self-supervised pre-training with DINOv2 on 25 million 2D DBT slices from nearly 28,000 patients. They evaluated DBT-DINO across three tasks: breast density classification, breast cancer risk prediction, and lesion detection.

Result: DBT-DINO surpassed baseline models in breast density classification and breast cancer risk prediction but was outperformed in general lesion detection by an ImageNet-pretrained model. It did, however, perform better on detecting cancerous lesions specifically.

Conclusion: While DBT-DINO demonstrates promising capabilities in some tasks, the paper highlights limitations in using domain-specific pre-training for localized detection tasks, suggesting further research is needed to refine methodologies.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise in medical imaging but remain underexplored for three-dimensional imaging modalities. No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening.
  To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training.
  Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes.
  For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%.
  Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.

Conclusion: Do-Undo serves as an intuitive testbed for enhancing physical reasoning capabilities within multimodal systems, with potential applications in embodied AI, robotics, and generative modeling.

Abstract: We introduce the Do-Undo task and benchmark to address a critical gap in vision-language models: understanding and generating physically plausible scene transformations driven by real-world actions. Unlike prior work focused on object-level edits, Do-Undo requires models to simulate the outcome of a physical action and then accurately reverse it, reflecting true cause-and-effect in the visual world. We curate a large-scale dataset of reversible actions from real-world videos and design a training strategy enforcing consistency for robust action grounding. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with physical reversibility, underscoring the importance of this task for embodied AI, robotics, and physics-aware generative modeling. Do-Undo establishes an intuitive testbed for evaluating and advancing physical reasoning in multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCR2-ST is a novel framework designed to reduce costs and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data acquisition and prediction by leveraging knowledge from single-cell sequencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spatial transcriptomics is expensive, and current fixed-grid sampling often collects redundant or uninformative data. Single-cell sequencing offers rich biological information that can address these limitations, motivating the development of a framework integrating both approaches.

Method: SCR2-ST introduces a two-component system: SCRL, a reinforcement learning-based active sampling method using single-cell embeddings and spatial density information to identify informative tissue regions, and SCR2Net, a hybrid inference network combining regression and retrieval-augmented approaches to predict gene expressions accurately.

Result: SCR2-ST demonstrated state-of-the-art sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially under low-budget constraints, when tested on three public spatial transcriptomics datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SCR2-ST framework successfully utilizes single-cell sequencing knowledge to guide efficient ST data acquisition and improve prediction models, making it a valuable tool for cost-efficient and precise spatial transcriptomic studies.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper presents Grab-3D, a transformer-based framework using 3D geometry patterns to detect AI-generated videos, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advent of diffusion-based models producing realistic videos, there is a critical need for robust detection methods to distinguish real content from AI-generated videos, especially due to discrepancies in 3D geometric patterns.

Method: The authors introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework utilizing vanishing points to analyze 3D geometric temporal consistency. The method includes geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier. They also develop a dataset of AI-generated videos for effective evaluation.

Result: Grab-3D outperforms state-of-the-art detectors and shows strong generalization across unseen video generators in terms of detection performance.

Conclusion: 3D geometric temporal consistency provides a reliable means to distinguish real from AI-generated videos, and Grab-3D demonstrates its efficacy, paving the way for advanced detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generation techniques enable AI models to produce highly realistic videos, heightening the need for reliable detection mechanisms. However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Grab-3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, achieving robust cross-domain generalization to unseen generators.

*Junwen Miao,Penghui Du,Yi Liu,Yu Wang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgentIAD, an advanced framework for industrial anomaly detection utilizing structured multi-stage vision analysis, achieving remarkable accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection is challenging due to the lack of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of defects, leading to a need for more refined and explicit visual inspection methods.

Method: The authors propose AgentIAD, which uses a Perceptive Zoomer for fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever for enhanced normal pattern comparison. The model is trained through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using a novel reward system that prioritizes accuracy and efficient tool usage.

Result: AgentIAD achieved a state-of-the-art classification accuracy (97.62%) on the MMAD dataset, surpassing previous MLLM-based methods and providing interpretable inspection processes.

Conclusion: AgentIAD demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating multi-stage inspection and vision-language tools for anomaly detection, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and interpretability in industrial applications.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is difficult due to the scarcity of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of many defects. Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We propose AgentIAD, a tool-driven agentic framework that enables multi-stage visual inspection. The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces.

*Xiaohu Huang,Hao Zhou,Qiangpeng Yang,Shilei Wen,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JoVA is a framework for joint video-audio generation that advances lip-sync accuracy and simplifies architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating synchronized human speech with lip movements and simplify model design by removing additional alignment modules.

Method: JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens and introduces a mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection.

Result: JoVA achieves superior or competitive results in benchmarks for lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall generation fidelity.

Conclusion: JoVA is an effective framework for high-quality video-audio generation, balancing simplicity and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present JoVA, a unified framework for joint video-audio generation. Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation.

Result: Steer3D showed superior fidelity to language instructions, consistency with original assets, and faster performance compared to competitors.

Conclusion: Adding text steerability to image-to-3D models is achievable with 100k data, enabling quick and consistent 3D asset editing.

Abstract: Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER transforms offline video reconstruction models into streaming systems without retraining, utilizing layer-wise scale alignment for accurate processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing streaming video reconstruction methods which require retraining and struggle to leverage strong geometric priors.

Method: Layer-wise scale alignment applied to depth predictions across temporal windows which avoids monocular scale ambiguity issues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction while maintaining efficiency at 14 FPS with low memory use.

Conclusion: LASER introduces a practical, training-free framework to enable offline models to operate effectively as streaming systems, improving scalability and deployment options for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent feed-forward reconstruction models like VGGT and $π^3$ achieve impressive reconstruction quality but cannot process streaming videos due to quadratic memory complexity, limiting their practical deployment. While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

*Lu Ling,Yunhao Ge,Yichen Sheng,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for interactive 3D scene generation by reprogramming a pre-trained 3D instance generator to replace dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision, achieving better generalization to unseen layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of poor generalization in interactive 3D scene generation due to reliance on limited datasets for spatial understanding.

Method: The authors reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to function as a scene-level learner using a view-centric spatial framework. This leverages the generator's transferable spatial knowledge to reason about spatial relationships directly from geometric cues.

Result: The reprogrammed generator demonstrated remarkable spatial understanding, even when trained on randomly composed scenes. It effectively inferred spatial properties such as proximity, support, and symmetry, and achieved strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that pre-trained instance generators inherently possess spatial reasoning capabilities, emphasizing their potential as foundation models for 3D scene generation and understanding.

Abstract: Generalization remains the central challenge for interactive 3D scene generation. Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes RVM (Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders), a transformer-based recurrent neural network for efficient video representation learning, achieving strong spatio-temporal understanding and competitive performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a video representation learning model that is parameter-efficient, captures spatio-temporal structures effectively, and performs well across diverse tasks while addressing limitations of existing methods like high computational cost.

Method: RVM employs a transformer-based recurrent neural network architecture that aggregates dense image features with a masked prediction task, requiring only pixel reconstruction. It efficiently propagates features over time with linear computational cost.

Result: RVM achieves competitive results on video-level tasks (e.g., action recognition) and spatial understanding benchmarks, showing up to 30x greater parameter efficiency. It also demonstrates stable long-term feature propagation and excels in various visual tasks.

Conclusion: RVM is a highly efficient and versatile model for video representation learning, addressing key challenges and offering strong performance in both video and image-based tasks. Its recurrent nature and efficiency make it suitable for long-term temporal understanding.

Abstract: We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.

### [335] [Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687)
*Jingfeng Yao,Yuda Song,Yucong Zhou,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies flaws in traditional visual tokenizer training and proposes VTP, a framework that optimizes latent space for high-level semantics to improve generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reconstruction-based visual tokenizer training produces latent spaces overly focused on low-level details, impairing generative model performance and creating inefficient scaling with compute investment.

Method: The VTP framework is proposed, combining image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction loss for joint optimization in visual tokenizer pre-training.

Result: VTP achieves improved scaling properties, competitive generation results, and significantly faster generation convergence compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Effective pre-training for generative models requires latent spaces that emphasize high-level understanding, and VTP demonstrates scalability and improved performance for this purpose.

Abstract: The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.

*Yuanwen Yue,Damien Robert,Jianyuan Wang,Sunghwan Hong,Jan Dirk Wegner,Christian Rupprecht,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LitePT, a neural architecture for 3D point cloud processing combining convolution and attention, achieving competitive results with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and performance of 3D point cloud processing by better integrating convolutional layers and attention blocks.

Method: The authors propose a method based on using convolution layers for early stages and attention layers for deeper stages in the architecture. They also introduce PointROPE, a novel 3D positional encoding that avoids loss of spatial information.

Result: The LitePT model exhibits 3.6x fewer parameters, runs 2x faster, and consumes 2x less memory than Point Transformer V3, while matching or outperforming it on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining convolution and attention blocks in a specific design principle results in an efficient and effective architecture for 3D point cloud tasks. LitePT achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Modern neural architectures for 3D point cloud processing contain both convolutional layers and attention blocks, but the best way to assemble them remains unclear. We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequate to extract low-level geometry at high-resolution in early layers, where attention is expensive without bringing any benefits; attention captures high-level semantics and context in low-resolution, deep layers more efficiently. Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers. To avoid the loss of spatial layout information when discarding redundant convolution layers, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D positional encoding, PointROPE. The resulting LitePT model has $3.6\times$ fewer parameters, runs $2\times$ faster, and uses $2\times$ less memory than the state-of-the-art Point Transformer V3, but nonetheless matches or even outperforms it on a range of tasks and datasets.

*Susung Hong,Chongjian Ge,Zhifei Zhang,Jui-Hsien Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiffusionBrowser, a tool for generating previews during video synthesis using video diffusion models, providing interactive and faster preview capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in video diffusion models, challenges including lack of precision, slow generation, and limited user transparency during the creation process persist.

Method: The authors propose DiffusionBrowser, which uses a lightweight, model-agnostic decoder framework to generate previews at any stage in the denoising process, supporting interactive control and multiple output modes.

Result: DiffusionBrowser enables the creation of multi-modal preview representations like RGB and scene intrinsics, achieves generation speeds over four times real-time, and introduces capabilities for guided generation and systematic probing.

Conclusion: DiffusionBrowser enhances user interaction, model transparency, and control over video synthesis processes, offering improved efficiency and insights during the denoising phase.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel hardware-software co-designed approach for optimizing GPU-based Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM), demonstrating significant performance enhancements over current techniques, especially for graph and GNN workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous scientific computing and data analytics applications, often bottlenecked by irregular memory access patterns. This paper presents Hash based Multi-phase SpGEMM on GPU and the Acceleration of Indirect Memory Access (AIA) technique, a novel custom near-memory processing approach to optimizing SpGEMM on GPU HBM. Our hardware-software co-designed framework for SpGEMM demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling complex, application-specific workloads. We evaluate our approach on various graph workloads, including graph contraction, Markov clustering, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), showcasing its practical applicability. For graph analytics applications, AIA demonstrates up to 17.3% time reduction from the software-only implementation, while achieving time reduction of 76.5% for Graph Contraction and 58.4% for Markov Clustering compared to cuSPARSE. For GNN training applications with structured global pruning, our hybrid approach delivers an average of 1.43x speedup over software-only implementation across six benchmark datasets and three architectures (GCN, GIN, GraphSAGE), and shows 1.95x speedup for GNN workloads when compared to cuSPARSE, with up to 4.18x gains on large-scale datasets.

*Wenjun Yu,Sitian Chen,Cheng Chen,Amelie Chi Zhou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LiveUpdate is a system that colocates low-rank adaptation trainers within inference nodes to overcome synchronization bottlenecks in Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs), improving model accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLRMs face a freshness-accuracy tradeoff due to synchronization overheads between training and inference clusters, which degrades recommendation quality and revenue.

Method: LiveUpdate employs dynamic rank adaptation and NUMA-aware resource scheduling to colocate updates in inference nodes, reducing memory costs and managing latency impacts.

Result: LiveUpdate achieves 2x reduction in update costs compared to baseline methods with higher accuracy improvements (0.04% to 0.24%) over state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: The system enables more efficient and accurate recommendations by turning idle computational resources into on-the-fly model update engines, addressing key DLRM challenges.

Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) underpin personalized services but face a critical freshness-accuracy tradeoff due to massive parameter synchronization overheads. Production DLRMs deploy decoupled training/inference clusters, where synchronizing petabyte-scale embedding tables (EMTs) causes multi-minute staleness, degrading recommendation quality and revenue. We observe that (1) inference nodes exhibit sustained CPU underutilization (peak <= 20%), and (2) EMT gradients possess intrinsic low-rank structure, enabling compact update representation. We present LiveUpdate, a system that eliminates inter-cluster synchronization by colocating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) trainers within inference nodes. LiveUpdate addresses two core challenges: (1) dynamic rank adaptation via singular value monitoring to constrain memory overhead (<2% of EMTs), and (2) NUMA-aware resource scheduling with hardware-enforced QoS to eliminate update inference contention (P99 latency impact <20ms). Evaluations show LiveUpdate reduces update costs by 2x versus delta-update baselines while achieving higher accuracy within 1-hour windows. By transforming idle inference resources into freshness engines, LiveUpdate delivers online model updates while outperforming state-of-the-art delta-update methods by 0.04% to 0.24% in accuracy.

*Vlad Popescu-Vifor,Ilir Murturi,Praveen Kumar Donta,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to resolve resource conflicts in edge, fog, and cloud environments, demonstrating scalability and efficiency in orchestration systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapidly increasing device diversity and the need for decentralized computing introduce orchestration challenges, such as inefficiency and conflicts among resource optimization agents.

Method: A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework was implemented to adaptively resolve resource conflicts based on real-time feedback and historical data in a Kubernetes testbed.

Result: The DRL-based framework achieved efficient resource allocation and adaptive learning in dynamic environments, showing resilience and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for conflict-aware resource orchestration by leveraging DRL adaptability, proving its practical viability in decentralized computing scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing device heterogeneity and decentralization requirements in the computing continuum (i.e., spanning edge, fog, and cloud) introduce new challenges in resource orchestration. In such environments, agents are often responsible for optimizing resource usage across deployed services. However, agent decisions can lead to persistent conflict loops, inefficient resource utilization, and degraded service performance. To overcome such challenges, we propose a novel framework for adaptive conflict resolution in resource-oriented orchestration using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. The framework enables handling resource conflicts across deployments and integrates a DRL model trained to mediate such conflicts based on real-time performance feedback and historical state information. The framework has been prototyped and validated on a Kubernetes-based testbed, illustrating its methodological feasibility and architectural resilience. Preliminary results show that the framework achieves efficient resource reallocation and adaptive learning in dynamic scenarios, thus providing a scalable and resilient solution for conflict-aware orchestration in the computing continuum.

*Xuyang Liu,Zijian Zhang,Zhen Li,Jiahang Sun,Jiamou Liu,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Sliding Window Leader Election (SWLE) mechanism, a novel protocol-independent leader election framework for partially synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols, offering significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reputation-based leader election frameworks have shortcomings such as narrow applicability, unbounded recovery, and dependency on specific protocols, creating a need for a generic and effective solution.

Method: The authors propose a protocol-independent abstraction for correctness and effectiveness in leader election, and design the SWLE mechanism that dynamically adjusts leader nominations based on reputation scores derived from consensus behavior.

Result: SWLE is shown to optimize throughput by up to 4.2x, reduce latency by 75%, and lower Byzantine leader frequency by 27% compared to state-of-the-art solutions, demonstrated through deployment tests across regions in northern China.

Conclusion: SWLE satisfies the proposed abstraction properties, introduces minimal protocol overhead, and significantly improves performance and reliability, positioning it as a superior leader election mechanism in partially synchronous BFT systems.

Abstract: Leader election serves a well-defined role in leader-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols. Existing reputation-based leader election frameworks for partially synchronous BFTs suffer from either protocol-specific proofs, narrow applicability, or unbounded recovery after network stabilization, leaving an open problem. This paper presents a novel protocol-independent abstraction formalizing generic correctness properties and effectiveness guarantees for leader election under partial synchrony, enabling protocol-independent analysis and design. Building on this, we design the Sliding Window Leader Election (SWLE) mechanism. SWLE dynamically adjusts leader nominations via consensus-behavior-based reputation scores, enforcing Byzantine-cost amplification. We demonstrate SWLE introduces minimal extra overhead to the base protocol and prove it satisfies all abstraction properties and provides superior effectiveness. We show, with a 16-server deployment across 4 different regions in northern China, SWLE achieves up to 4.2x higher throughput, 75% lower latency and 27% Byzantine leader frequency compared to the state-of-the-art solution under common Byzantine faults, while maintaining efficiency in fault-free scenarios.

### [342] [Fine-Grained Energy Prediction For Parallellized LLM Inference With PIE-P](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12801)
*Anurag Dutt,Young Won Choi,Avirup Sil,Anshul Gandhi,Aruna Balasubramanian,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents PIE-P, a framework for accurately predicting energy consumption of Large Language Models during multi-GPU inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for measuring energy consumption of LLMs are insufficient due to hardware limitations and inaccuracies, especially in multi-GPU setups.

Method: The authors designed PIE-P, a scalable framework using precise sampling, detailed modeling of inter-GPU communication, and accounting for parallelization overhead.

Result: PIE-P significantly improves accuracy in energy prediction across tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism strategies, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PIE-P enables fine-grained and precise energy predictions under multi-GPU inference environments, addressing critical shortcomings in existing approaches.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), energy costs of running LLMs is quickly becoming a critical concern. However, precisely measuring the energy consumption of LLMs is often infeasible because hardware-based power monitors are not always accessible and software-based energy measurement tools are not accurate. While various prediction techniques have been developed to estimate LLM energy consumption, these approaches are limited to single-GPU environments and thus are not applicable to modern LLM inference which is typically parallelized across multiple GPUs. In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase. We develop a scalable prediction framework that addresses these issues via precise sampling, fine-grained modeling of inter-GPU communication, and careful accounting of parallelization overhead. Our evaluation results show that PIE-P yields accurate and fine-grained energy predictions across parallelism strategies, significantly outperforming baselines.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HetRL is a distributed system designed to optimize RL training for LLMs on heterogeneous GPUs, achieving significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shortage of high-end GPUs and the underutilization of mid-range or previous-generation GPUs in different regions call for efficient RL training in heterogeneous environments.

Method: HetRL schedules RL training as a constrained joint optimization problem using a novel algorithm with a multi-level search framework and successive halving for resource allocation.

Result: Extensive testing revealed that HetRL achieves up to 9.17x the throughput of state-of-the-art systems under diverse workloads, utilizing 20,000 GPU-hours.

Conclusion: HetRL effectively enhances RL training performance on heterogeneous GPUs by optimizing complex scheduling workflows, paving the way for better resource utilization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale and new GPUs are released even more frequently, there is an increasing demand for LLM post-training in heterogeneous environments to fully leverage underutilized mid-range or previous-generation GPUs across regions and alleviate the shortage of homogeneous high-end GPUs within a single region. However, achieving high-performance reinforcement learning (RL) training for LLMs on such computing resources remains challenging because the workflow involves multiple models and tasks with complex computation and data dependencies. In this paper, we present HetRL, a distributed system for efficient RL training in infrastructures with heterogeneous GPUs and networks. HetRL formulates the scheduling of RL training in heterogeneous environments as a constrained joint optimization problem and introduces a novel scheduling algorithm that (1) decomposes the complex search space with a multi-level search framework; and (2) allocates the search budget via successive halving. Our extensive evaluation, consuming 20,000 GPU-hours, shows that HetRL delivers up to 9.17x the throughput of state-of-the-art systems, and 3.17x on average, under various workloads and settings.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces astroCAMP, a framework for improving the energy efficiency, scientific return, and co-design of imaging pipelines for the SKA project's high data and energy demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in current radio-interferometric pipelines, which operate at only 4-14% hardware performance due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, leading to high energy and carbon costs.

Method: astroCAMP offers standard metrics for fidelity, performance, and sustainability, datasets for reproducible benchmarks, and a co-design tool to link scientific constraints with energy and cost efficiencies.

Result: The framework benchmarks current tools (WSClean and IDG) on modern hardware and explores the potential of heterogeneous CPU-FPGA co-design for sustainable configurations.

Conclusion: astroCAMP is a vital tool for optimizing next-generation scientific pipelines for SKA's energy and operational constraints, urging the community to establish fidelity thresholds for better optimization.

Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project will operate one of the world's largest continuous scientific data systems, sustaining petascale imaging under strict power caps. Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments. Last, we make a call to the SKA community to define quantifiable fidelity metrics and thresholds to accelerate principled optimisation for SKA-scale imaging.

*Duc A. Tran,Dung Truong,Duy Le*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper tackles edge server deployment in mobile edge computing under uncertain and varying workloads using stochastic bilevel optimization and proposes a submodular maximization approach for practical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile edge computing faces challenges in server placement and user cell assignment amidst unknown and time-varying workload conditions.

Method: The authors formulate the problem as stochastic bilevel optimization and utilize submodular maximization with greedy algorithms to solve it efficiently.

Result: Real-world data evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, with improvements up to 55% compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The study provides an effective solution for sustainable server selection and cell assignment under uncertainties, contributing significantly to mobile edge computing efficiency.

Abstract: Server deployment is a fundamental task in mobile edge computing: where to place the edge servers and what user cells to assign to them. To make this decision is context-specific, but common goals are 1) computing efficiency: maximize the amount of workload processed by the edge, and 2) communication efficiency: minimize the communication cost between the cells and their assigned servers. We focus on practical scenarios where the user workload in each cell is unknown and time-varying, and so are the effective capacities of the servers. Our research problem is to choose a subset of candidate servers and assign them to the user cells such that the above goals are sustainably achieved under the above uncertainties. We formulate this problem as a stochastic bilevel optimization, which is strongly NP-hard and unseen in the literature. By approximating the objective function with submodular functions, we can utilize state-of-the-art greedy algorithms for submodular maximization to effectively solve our problem. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using real-world data, showing its superiority to alternative methods; the improvement can be as high as 55%

TL;DR: This paper examines the ethical risks in Layer 2 rollups, focusing on operator and governance designs exposing users to systemic risks. It provides mitigation strategies informed by detailed analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates which operator and governance designs introduce ethical risks to users in Layer 2 rollups, prompted by concerns about operator discretion and information asymmetry.

Method: The authors adapted Ethical Risk Analysis to rollup architectures, built a taxonomy of decision authority and exposure, analyzed empirical data from L2BEAT and curated incidents from 2022 to 2025 to identify mechanisms that put user funds at risk.

Result: Findings reveal widespread ethical hazards in Layer 2 designs, with 86% of projects allowing instant upgrades without exit windows and 50% enabling freezeable withdrawals. Reported problems are concentrated in sequencer liveness and inclusion.

Conclusion: Layer 2 designs often introduce ethical risks stemming from systemic control issues. The paper suggests strategies to mitigate user risks via improved technical components and governance mechanisms.

Abstract: Layer 2 rollups improve throughput and fees, but can reintroduce risk through operator discretion and information asymmetry. We ask which operator and governance designs produce ethically problematic user risk. We adapt Ethical Risk Analysis to rollup architectures, build a role-based taxonomy of decision authority and exposure, and pair the framework with two empirical signals, a cross sectional snapshot of 129 projects from L2BEAT and a hand curated incident set covering 2022 to 2025. We analyze mechanisms that affect risks to users funds, including upgrade timing and exit windows, proposer liveness and whitelisting, forced inclusion usability, and data availability choices. We find that ethical hazards rooted in L2 components control arrangements are widespread: instant upgrades without exit windows appear in about 86 percent of projects, and proposer controls that can freeze withdrawals in about 50 percent. Reported incidents concentrate in sequencer liveness and inclusion, consistent with these dependencies. We translate these findings into ethically grounded suggestions on mitigation strategies including technical components and governance mechanisms.

*Weizhe Huang,Tao Peng,Tongxuan Liu,Donghe Jin,Xianzhe Dong,Ke Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PROSERVE, a scheduling framework for serving large language models (LLMs) that considers client priorities and latency requirements to maximize service gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize service level objectives (SLO) and client-level priorities, leading to suboptimal performance for high-priority clients.

Method: A unified two-tier scheduling framework using SlideBatching at the engine level for dynamic batching and GoRouting at the service level for gain-oriented dispatching.

Result: PROSERVE outperforms existing methods, improving system gain by 35% and SLO attainment by 52%, as demonstrated on datasets and real-world traces.

Conclusion: PROSERVE addresses priority differences among clients and latency requirements, delivering superior performance and optimization compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) for interactive applications necessitates serving systems that can handle thousands of concurrent requests with diverse Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements. A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities.
  To bridge this gap, we first \textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests. Extensive evaluation across four open-source datasets and a real-world industrial trace demonstrates that \systemname{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving system gain by up to 35% and boosting SLO attainment by up to 52%.

*Ziyu Huang,Yangjie Zhou,Zihan Liu,Xinhao Luo,Yijia Diao,Minyi Guo,Jidong Zhai,Yu Feng,Chen Zhang,Anbang Wu,Jingwen Leng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashFuser introduces an innovative framework to harness Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) in modern GPUs for kernel fusion, reducing memory access and enhancing computation throughput significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning workloads often face memory-bound challenges due to the faster scaling of computation than memory bandwidth. Existing kernel fusion methods fail when intermediate data exceeds memory limits, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The paper presents FlashFuser, a compiler framework that exploits DSM in modern GPUs for kernel fusion. It incorporates a DSM-based communication abstraction, a dataflow analyzer, and a unified search engine for optimized execution planning.

Result: Experimental results on NVIDIA H100 GPU show FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58%, achieves kernel speedups of 3.3x (against tuned libraries) and 4.1x (against state-of-the-art compilers), leading to a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.

Conclusion: FlashFuser effectively utilizes modern GPU hardware capabilities to overcome memory-bound issues in deep learning. The advancements provide significant computational efficiency and better utilization of GPU resources, setting a precedent for future frameworks.

Abstract: The scaling of computation throughput continues to outpace improvements in memory bandwidth, making many deep learning workloads memory-bound. Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.

Motivation: The study aims to improve routing performance and fault tolerance in 2D torus NoCs, which are used for their low diameter and high connectivity, by proposing an RL-based adaptive routing strategy to handle node faults effectively.

Method: The RL strategy models each router as an independent agent, learning to forward packets based on the network state. A baseline adaptive routing scheme relies on fixed minimal paths with simple rerouting around faults. Both techniques are tested via simulations with up to 50 random node faults to evaluate key metrics.

Result: The RL approach outperforms the baseline, achieving up to 20-30% higher throughput at high loads, better fault tolerance (PDR above 90% up to 30-40 faults compared to 70% for the baseline), and higher fault adaptive scores in 2D torus NoCs.

Conclusion: The RL-based routing method is a superior strategy for improving fault resilience and maintaining high throughput and end-to-end connectivity in torus NoCs compared to traditional adaptive routing approaches.

Abstract: We investigate adaptive minimal routing in 2D torus networks on chip NoCs under node fault conditions comparing a reinforcement learning RL based strategy to an adaptive routing baseline A torus topology is used for its low diameter high connectivity properties The RL approach models each router as an agent that learns to forward packets based on network state while the adaptive scheme uses fixed minimal paths with simple rerouting around faults We implement both methods in simulation injecting up to 50 node faults uniformly at random Key metrics are measured 1 throughput vs offered load at fault density 02 2 packet delivery ratio PDR vs fault density and 3 a fault adaptive score FT vs fault density Experimental results show the RL method achieves significantly higher throughput at high load approximately 2030 gain and maintains higher reliability under increasing faults The RL router delivers more packets per cycle and adapts to faults by exploiting path diversity whereas the adaptive scheme degrades sharply as faults accumulate In particular the RL approach preserves end to end connectivity longer PDR remains above 90 until approximately 3040 faults while adaptive PDR drops to approximately 70 at the same point The fault adaptive score likewise favors RL routing Thus RL based adaptive routing demonstrates clear advantages in throughput and fault resilience for torus NoCs

*Muhammad Alfian Amrizal,Raka Satya Prasasta,Santana Yuda Pradata,Kadek Gemilang Santiyuda,Reza Pulungan,Hiroyuki Takizawa*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SPARS is a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator designed to optimize power management in HPC clusters for better energy efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enormous energy waste in HPC clusters due to idle nodes demands smarter power management solutions.

Method: SPARS combines job scheduling and power state management in a discrete-event simulation framework, using reinforcement learning for power transitions and modular tools for extensive analysis.

Result: SPARS reduces energy waste by effectively scheduling node power transitions and provides a platform for easily testing and extending power-aware strategies.

Conclusion: SPARS promotes sustainable HPC operations by enabling systematic evaluation of energy-efficient scheduling without compromising performance.

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) clusters consume enormous amounts of energy, with idle nodes as a major source of waste. Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations.

*Hassan Razavi,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parallel-in-time method to accelerate the computation of MAP trajectory estimates for states of stochastic differential equations. It leverages graphics processing units and achieves faster computations without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for faster computational methods on parallel architectures when estimating MAP trajectories of dynamic systems governed by stochastic differential equations.

Method: The authors reformulate the MAP estimation problem as an optimal control problem using the Onsager-Machlup functional, allowing the employment of parallel associative scan algorithms to solve the resulting problem efficiently.

Result: Experiments showed significant computational speed improvements using GPUs while preserving algorithm accuracy for both linear and nonlinear state-space models.

Conclusion: Reformulating MAP estimation into a parallel-in-time framework leads to efficient and accurate computation for stochastic models, offering practical advantages in high-performance computing scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.

TL;DR: DiT is an automated framework for efficient software deployment on tile-based PE accelerators, evaluated with GEMM workloads to outperform high-level competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tile-based PE accelerators excel in performance for GEMM but are challenging to program due to hardware-software co-dependency, necessitating automation.

Method: The authors developed the 'Design in Tiles (DiT)' framework, integrating a deployment toolchain with a configurable model for evaluating accelerators.

Result: DiT achieves higher PE utilization and 1.2-2.0x speedup over NVIDIA GH200 GEMM libraries for various matrix shapes.

Conclusion: DiT simplifies deployment while enhancing performance, proving competitive and effective for tile-based PE accelerator workloads.

Abstract: Tile-based many-Processing Element (PE) accelerators can achieve competitive performance on General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), but they are extremely hard to program, as their optimal software mapping is deeply coupled with hardware design which is unwieldy to manual deployment. We propose "Design in Tiles (DiT)", an automated framework connecting a deployment toolchain with a configurable executable model for these accelerators. For evaluation, we apply our framework to GEMM targeting a large acceleration configuration (e.g., 32x32 tiles, 1979 TFLOPS@FP8, 4 TB/s Bandwidth) comparable to an NVIDIA GH200. We achieve higher PE utilization than GH200 with its expert-tuned GEMM libraries, achieving 1.2-2.0x speedup across diverse matrix shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges associated with early-life AI accelerators such as system reliability, training correctness, and computational efficiency during large-scale training projects.

Method: Developing and utilizing the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP) and LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) for optimized training on clusters with early-life AI accelerators.

Result: LTP showed 94.45% effective utilization and reduced operational inefficiencies, while the LTF trained a 200B model (SIGMA-MOE) with 2,048 AI accelerators, achieving high efficiency, stability, and accuracy outcomes.

Conclusion: SIGMA provides a cost-effective, robust platform for large-scale AI training, improving upon current AI accelerator stacks and promoting innovation in AI scalability.

Abstract: An increasing variety of AI accelerators is being considered for large-scale training. However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability.

*Zhexiang Zhang,Ye Wang,Xiangyu Wang,Yumiao Zhao,Jingzhe Jiang,Qizhen Weng,Shaohuai Shi,Yin Chen,Minchen Yu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Janus, a system enhancing scalable inference for MoE models by disaggregating attention and expert GPU sub-clusters, optimizing communication, scheduling, and resource management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE inference systems are resource-inefficient and cannot scale effectively due to a monolithic architecture that uses uniform configurations for attention and expert modules with distinct requirements.

Method: Janus disaggregates attention and expert modules into separate GPU sub-clusters, introduces an adaptive two-phase communication scheme, implements a lightweight scheduler as a GPU kernel for balanced activation, and fine-tunes resource management.

Result: Janus demonstrates up to 3.9 times higher GPU throughput compared to contemporary solutions while maintaining required inference latency per token.

Conclusion: The disaggregated approach of Janus effectively improves scalability, resource efficiency, and performance in MoE model inference, addressing key limitations of prior systems.

Abstract: Large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model inference is challenging due to high resource demands and dynamic workloads. Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.

### [355] [Active Inference with Reusable State-Dependent Value Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11829)
*Jacob Poschl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "value profiles" to manage control parameters across latent contexts in volatile environments. These profiles enable adaptive behavior without requiring independent parameters for each context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of intractability in maintaining separate parameters for preferences, policy biases, and action-confidence across various contexts in volatile environments.

Method: The authors propose a generative model with reusable value profiles. They compared static-precision, dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using probabilistic reversal learning and validated models via information criteria.

Result: The profile-based model outperformed simpler alternatives with significant differences in model comparison (e.g., ~100-point AIC difference), and analyses confirmed structural identifiability.

Conclusion: Reusable value profiles provide a computationally efficient framework for belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments, offering insights into state-conditional control and behavioral flexibility.

Abstract: Adaptive behavior in volatile environments requires agents to switch among value-control regimes across latent contexts, but maintaining separate preferences, policy biases, and action-confidence parameters for every situation is intractable. We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address current AI models' limitation in understanding cause-and-effect relationships in medical image analysis, thus improving diagnostic quality and trustworthiness in clinical practice.

Method: The method involves the CR3G framework, a prompt-driven system focusing on causal reasoning in chest X-ray report generation.

Result: CR3G showed improved causal relationship and explanatory capability for 2 out of 5 tested abnormalities.

Conclusion: CR3G enhances the quality of AI-driven diagnostics by focusing on causality and patient-centric explanations, making reports more reliable and clinically relevant.

Abstract: Automatic chest X-ray report generation is an important area of research aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy and helping doctors make faster decisions. Current AI models are good at finding correlations (or patterns) in medical images. Still, they often struggle to understand the deeper cause-and-effect relationships between those patterns and a patient condition. Causal inference is a powerful approach that goes beyond identifying patterns to uncover why certain findings in an X-ray relate to a specific diagnosis. In this paper, we will explore the prompt-driven framework Causal Reasoning for Patient-Centric Explanations in radiology Report Generation (CR3G) that is applied to chest X-ray analysis to improve understanding of AI-generated reports by focusing on cause-and-effect relationships, reasoning and generate patient-centric explanation. The aim to enhance the quality of AI-driven diagnostics, making them more useful and trustworthy in clinical practice. CR3G has shown better causal relationship capability and explanation capability for 2 out of 5 abnormalities.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the closely coupled nature of theoretical derivation and practical implementation in few-step diffusion models, which obscures the design space.

Method: The authors provide a common design framework for shortcut diffusion models, offering theoretical justification and disentangling component-level design choices.

Result: The improved one-step diffusion model achieved an FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256, setting a new state-of-the-art under classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates systematic innovation and exploration in the design of shortcut diffusion models, lowering the barrier for further advancements.

Abstract: Recent advances in few-step diffusion models have demonstrated their efficiency and effectiveness by shortcutting the probabilistic paths of diffusion models, especially in training one-step diffusion models from scratch (a.k.a. shortcut models). However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space.

*Prashant Pandey*

TL;DR: The paper investigates reusing cached attention key-value states for small language models, specifically DialoGPT-medium, to enhance inference speed and context memory size via token recycling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if cached attention key-value states of one language model prompt can be efficiently reused to accelerate inference and expand context memory capacity.

Method: Using DialoGPT-medium, cached past activations are retrieved via sentence embeddings and reused when the new prompt contains an exact prefix match. Reproducibility is achieved without model modifications by serializing and reloading cached KVs.

Result: Observations show consistent speedups during prefix overlap without degrading output semantics. When no overlap exists, performance aligns with baseline runs.

Conclusion: Cached attention states can reliably improve inference speed under prefix overlap conditions without affecting the model's output quality.

Abstract: Whether attention key value (KV) states computed for one prompt for a small LLM can be reused to accelerate inference on a new similar prompt, giving an increase to the space to its context memory using an approach called token recycling. Using a standard Hugging Face setup with DialoGPT-medium (a 345M parameter GPT-2 style decoder trained on 147M Reddit exchanges, 2005 to 2017) as the testbed, we build a cache of past activations and get entries by sentence embeddings, then reuse cached past key values when the cached prompt is an exact prefix of the new input. We compare recycled vs. baseline runs on latency and output fidelity, and log reuse depth in tokens. Reproducibility requires no model modifications, cached KVs are serialized to the CPU, reloaded, and supplied to the generate function to continue decoding from the cached prefix. In tests, we observe consistent speedups when prefix overlap exists, with no material degradation in output semantics, and when overlap is absent, behavior matches baseline.

Conclusion: Memristors with sufficiently wide resistance ranges are feasible for robust training of neural networks using equilibrium propagation, contributing to energy-efficient computing solutions.

Abstract: Memristor-based in-memory computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to overcome the constraints of the von Neumann bottleneck and the memory wall by enabling fully parallelisable and energy-efficient vector-matrix multiplications. We investigate the effect of nonlinear, memristor-driven weight updates on the convergence behaviour of neural networks trained with equilibrium propagation (EqProp). Six memristor models were characterised by their voltage-current hysteresis and integrated into the EBANA framework for evaluation on two benchmark classification tasks. EqProp can achieve robust convergence under nonlinear weight updates, provided that memristors exhibit a sufficiently wide resistance range of at least an order of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve state estimation and prediction for complex systems by resolving discrepancies between theoretical models and noisy experimental data.

Method: The method integrates the Parameterized Background Data-Weak framework with a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) constrained to focus on model deviations and includes an optimal sensor placement strategy.

Result: The hybrid approach is validated using a Helmholtz equation problem with modeling errors and demonstrates improved state estimation and prediction.

Conclusion: The combination of reduced-order modeling, DeepONet corrections, and sensor optimization enhances state estimation while preserving physical interpretability.

Abstract: The accurate estimation of the state of complex uncertain physical systems requires reconciling theoretical models, with inherent imperfections, with noisy experimental data. In this work, we propose an effective hybrid approach that combines physics-based modeling with data-driven learning to enhance state estimation and further prediction. Our method builds upon the Parameterized Background Data-Weak (PBDW) framework, which naturally integrates a reduced-order representation of the best-available model with measurement data to account for both anticipated and unanticipated uncertainties. To address model discrepancies not captured by the reduced-order space, and learn the structure of model deviation, we incorporate a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) constrained to be an orthogonal complement of the best-knowledge manifold. This ensures that the learned correction targets only the unknown components of model bias, preserving the interpretability and fidelity of the physical model. An optimal sensor placement strategy is also investigated to maximize information gained from measurements. We validate the proposed approach on a representative problem involving the Helmholtz equation under various sources of modeling error, including those arising from boundary conditions and source terms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing model interpretability and accuracy in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which is hindered by the complexity of architectural enhancements.

Method: Combining overprovisioned architectures with differentiable sparsification to enable end-to-end optimization for learning compact and interpretable models.

Result: The approach achieves competitive or superior accuracy while significantly reducing model size, showing synergy between overprovisioning and sparsification.

Conclusion: The method provides a balanced path to achieve more expressive and interpretable scientific machine learning models, resolving a key tension in KAN development.

Abstract: Efforts to improve Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) with architectural enhancements have been stymied by the complexity those enhancements bring, undermining the interpretability that makes KANs attractive in the first place. Here we study overprovisioned architectures combined with sparsification to learn compact, interpretable KANs without sacrificing accuracy. Crucially, we focus on differentiable sparsification, turning architecture search into an end-to-end optimization problem. Across function approximation benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, we demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy while discovering substantially smaller models. Overprovisioning and sparsification are synergistic, with the combination outperforming either alone. The result is a principled path toward models that are both more expressive and more interpretable, addressing a key tension in scientific machine learning.

Conclusion: The methodology efficiently translates language into actionable nutritional metrics, offering scalable applications for dietary assessments and research despite challenges with ambiguous or processed foods.

Abstract: Accurate nutritional assessment is critical for public health, but existing profiling systems require detailed data often unavailable or inaccessible from colloquial text descriptions of food. This paper presents a machine learning pipeline that predicts the comprehensive Food Compass Score 2.0 (FCS) from text descriptions. Our approach uses multi-headed neural networks to process hybrid feature vectors that combine semantic text embeddings, lexical patterns, and domain heuristics, alongside USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) data. The networks estimate the nutrient and food components necessary for the FCS algorithm. The system demonstratedstrong predictive power, achieving a median R^2 of 0.81 for individual nutrients. The predicted FCS correlated strongly with published values (Pearson's r = 0.77), with a mean absolute difference of 14.0 points. While errors were largest for ambiguous or processed foods, this methodology translates language into actionable nutritional information, enabling scalable dietary assessment for consumer applications and research.

Result: The model's performance improves with spatial encoding at larger scales than single-channel encoding, enhancing downstream decoding while achieving region-level encoding and accurate channel-level reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework enables exploration of spatial token encoding for self-supervised pretraining, revealing higher-scale spatial encoding benefits for neurofoundation models and improving decoding of multiregional brain activity.

Abstract: Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance.

### [366] [D-STEER - Preference Alignment Techniques Learn to Behave, not to Believe -- Beneath the Surface, DPO as Steering Vector Perturbation in Activation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11838)
*Samarth Raina,Saksham Aggarwal,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns large language models and concludes that it steers model activations in a low-rank preference direction rather than altering network beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal changes induced by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in large language models, as it is unclear whether DPO rewrites internal representations or simply adjusts activations.

Method: The study uses a theoretical derivation showing that DPO gradients depend on preference-related logit differences, empirical extraction of a steering vector, and spectral analysis to evaluate shift and alignment behaviors.

Result: The authors find that DPO alignment results in first-order shifts in hidden representations and that adding or subtracting an extracted steering vector alters the model's behavior. Spectral analysis reveals low-rank alignment mechanisms characteristic of a rank-one dominance.

Conclusion: DPO influences models to behave in alignment with preferences rather than fundamentally changing their beliefs, portraying alignment as a low-rank directional adjustment rather than semantic restructuring.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard recipe for aligning large language models, yet it is still unclear what kind of change it actually induces inside the network. This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe.

*Eray Erturk,Saba Hashemi,Maryam M. Shanechi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework aimed at improving modeling of local field potentials (LFPs) by leveraging insights from spike-based models, demonstrating effectiveness across different experimental setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of modeling LFPs, which exhibit lower predictive power due to their population-level nature, and improve their utility in neural experiments while utilizing their inherent advantages over spiking activity.

Method: A cross-modal knowledge distillation framework is designed where high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained spike transformer models is transferred to LFP transformer models. The spike model employs a masked autoencoding objective with neural tokenization, and the LFP model aligns its latent representations to the spike model.

Result: Distilled LFP models outperform traditional LFP baselines in unsupervised and supervised scenarios, delivering superior generalization across experiments without needing additional distillation.

Conclusion: Cross-modal knowledge distillation offers a scalable solution to enhance the modeling of LFPs, making them more accurate and practical for neural modeling tasks.

Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) can be routinely recorded alongside spiking activity in intracortical neural experiments, measure a larger complementary spatiotemporal scale of brain activity for scientific inquiry, and can offer practical advantages over spikes, including greater long-term stability, robustness to electrode degradation, and lower power requirements. Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.

### [368] [Large Language Models as Generalist Policies for Network Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11839)
*Duo Wu,Linjia Kang,Zhimin Wang,Fangxin Wang,Wei Zhang,Xuefeng Tao,Wei Yang,Le Zhang,Peng Cui,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Trailblazer, a framework using large language models (LLMs) for generalizable network policies. It demonstrates improved cross-task and cross-environment performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network optimization traditionally relies on specialist handcrafted rules or deep learning models, which lack generalization across tasks and environments, necessitating a shift toward a more unified and adaptive solution.

Method: The paper proposes Trailblazer, which grounds LLMs in networking tasks through a network alignment scheme and incorporates adaptive policy collaboration to improve efficiency by offloading simple tasks to lightweight policies.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world evaluations on Douyin show that Trailblazer achieves better generalization across tasks and environments compared to conventional specialist network policies.

Conclusion: Trailblazer highlights the potential of LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, offering strong generalization capabilities and reduced effort in policy design.

Abstract: Designing control policies to ensure robust network services is essential to modern digital infrastructure. However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design.

*Eray Erturk,Maryam M. Shanechi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for real-time decoding of information from multiple neural modalities with varying timescales, distributions, and missing samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for decoding multimodal neural activity struggle with different timescales, probabilistic distributions, and missing data across modalities, hindering real-time applications.

Method: The authors propose a learning framework with three components: a multiscale encoder, a multiscale dynamical backbone, and modality-specific decoders, enabling real-time aggregation of multimodal neural information.

Result: Simulations and analysis of three multiscale brain datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework improves real-time target decoding and outperforms benchmark models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles challenges in decoding multimodal neural data, making it suitable for neuroscience applications requiring real-time processing.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of target variables from multiple simultaneously recorded neural time-series modalities, such as discrete spiking activity and continuous field potentials, is important across various neuroscience applications. However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so.

*Mateusz Sypniewski,Mateusz Olko,Mateusz Gajewski,Piotr Miłoś*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using Prior-Fitted Networks (PFNs) to improve causal structure discovery, achieving better reliability and accuracy compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent research highlights that inaccuracies in likelihood estimation hinder proper causal structure discovery, even with large sample sizes.

Method: The authors employ Prior-Fitted Networks (PFNs) to deliver improved, amortized likelihood estimation that enables better reliability in causal structure learning.

Result: Experiments across synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate superior structure recovery and more accurate likelihood estimates compared to neural network baselines.

Conclusion: PFNs offer a promising solution by enhancing likelihood estimation accuracy, ultimately improving causal structure discovery.

Abstract: In recent years, differentiable penalized likelihood methods have gained popularity, optimizing the causal structure by maximizing its likelihood with respect to the data. However, recent research has shown that errors in likelihood estimation, even on relatively large sample sizes, disallow the discovery of proper structures. We propose a new approach to amortized causal discovery that addresses the limitations of likelihood estimator accuracy. Our method leverages Prior-Fitted Networks (PFNs) to amortize data-dependent likelihood estimation, yielding more reliable scores for structure learning. Experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets show significant gains in structure recovery compared to standard baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate directly that PFNs provide more accurate likelihood estimates than conventional neural network-based approaches.

*DongKyu Kim,Han-Lin Hsieh,Maryam M. Shanechi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel unsupervised learning algorithm to accurately model regime-dependent switching dynamics in neural populations using multiscale neural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to model regime-dependent non-stationary dynamics and accommodate multiple neural modalities recorded simultaneously, which are important for understanding behavior encoding.

Method: The authors propose an unsupervised learning algorithm that works with switching multiscale dynamical system models using multiscale neural observations, such as multimodal spike-LFP data.

Result: The developed models outperform both single-scale and stationary models in accurately decoding behavior and tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in simulations and experimental datasets.

Conclusion: This approach advances the understanding of complex neural dynamics, potentially improving brain-computer interfaces by incorporating multiscale multimodal recordings and regime switching.

Abstract: Neural population activity often exhibits regime-dependent non-stationarity in the form of switching dynamics. Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight forecasting method for improving handover (HO) efficiency in cellular networks under dynamic user mobility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise mobility forecasting to address issues in cellular handover caused by abrupt and unpredictable user behaviors.

Method: A GRU-based predictor combined with Reptile meta-initialization for rapid few-shot adaptation and EWMA residual detector for online drift corrections.

Result: Achieved improved forecasting accuracy (ADE 3.71 m at 10-shot) and faster drift recovery compared to conventional models, enhancing HO prediction metrics (F1 0.83, AUROC 0.90).

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows promise in improving HO efficiency, reducing errors, and being deployable on edge devices for 5G/6G networks due to its lightweight design.

Abstract: Short-term mobility forecasting is a core requirement for proactive handover (HO) in cellular networks. Real-world mobility is highly non-stationary: abrupt turns, rapid speed changes, and unpredictable user behavior cause conventional predictors to drift, leading to mistimed or failed handovers. We propose a lightweight meta-continual forecasting framework that integrates a GRU-based predictor, Reptile meta-initialization for fast few-shot adaptation, and an EWMA residual detector that triggers compact online updates only when drift occurs. Evaluated on a reproducible GeoLife and DeepMIMO pipeline, our method achieves 4.46 m ADE and 7.79 m FDE in zero-shot settings, improves few-shot ADE to 3.71 m at 10-shot, and enables recovery from abrupt drift about 2 to 3 times faster than an offline GRU. When applied to downstream HO prediction, the approach improves F1 to 0.83 and AUROC to 0.90, with substantial reductions in missed-HO and ping-pong events. The model is lightweight (128k parameters) and suitable for edge deployment in 5G and 6G systems.

*Yuseon Choi,Sangjin Kim,Jungjun Oh,Byeongcheol Kim,Hoi-Jun Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeVeDo addresses outlier issues in low-bit quantization for transformers using SVD-based methods, achieving high energy efficiency and minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient transformer inference faces challenges due to activation outliers that reduce accuracy in aggressive low-bit quantization methods.

Method: SeVeDo structurally separates outlier-sensitive components using a low-rank path while employing group quantization and hierarchical strategies to optimize energy efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show SeVeDo achieves peak energy efficiency up to 13.8TOPS/W, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B benchmarks.

Conclusion: SeVeDo improves computational and energy efficiency in transformers through SVD-based techniques, offering a balanced approach between accuracy and hardware demand.

Abstract: Low-bit quantization is a promising technique for efficient transformer inference by reducing computational and memory overhead. However, aggressive bitwidth reduction remains challenging due to activation outliers, leading to accuracy degradation. Existing methods, such as outlier-handling and group quantization, achieve high accuracy but incur substantial energy consumption. To address this, we propose SeVeDo, an energy-efficient SVD-based heterogeneous accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive components into a high-precision low-rank path, while the remaining computations are executed in a low-bit residual datapath with group quantization. To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost. Experimental results show that SeVeDo achieves a peak energy efficiency of 13.8TOPS/W, surpassing conventional designs, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B benchmarks.

*Wenbo Du,Lingling Han,Ying Xiong,Ling Zhang,Biyue Li,Yisheng Lv,Tong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DTSFormer, a new Transformer model for forecasting airport passenger flows. It outperforms existing models by using deformable partitioning and frequency-domain attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of airport passenger flow predictions by addressing the limitations of fixed-size patch embedding in existing Transformer models, which struggle to capture complex, heterogeneous patterns.

Method: The authors propose DTSFormer, integrating a dynamic multiscale deformable partitioning module and frequency-domain attention to model heterogeneous trends and joint temporal-spectral features. They fuse high- and low-frequency components for better prediction.

Result: Experiments on passenger flow data from Beijing Capital International Airport (Jan 2023 - Mar 2024) show DTSFormer outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across prediction horizons.

Conclusion: DTSFormer effectively models heterogeneous patterns and captures sudden high-frequency fluctuations, making it a superior model for forecasting airport passenger flows.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of passenger flows is critical for maintaining the efficiency and resilience of airport operations. Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations.

Result: The approach improves convergence consistency, reduces gradient variance, minimizes communication overhead, and enhances noise tolerance in constrained vehicular-edge scenarios.

Conclusion: NR-QFL demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced FL for scalable, secure, and efficient ADAS intelligence at the edge of vehicular networks.

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) increasingly employ Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train models across distributed vehicular nodes while preserving data privacy. Yet, conventional FL aggregation remains susceptible to noise, latency, and security constraints inherent to real-time vehicular networks. This paper introduces Noise-Resilient Quantum Federated Learning (NR-QFL), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables secure, low-latency aggregation through variational quantum circuits (VQCs) operating under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) conditions. The framework encodes model parameters as quantum states with adaptive gate reparameterization, ensuring bounded-error convergence and provable resilience under Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. NR-QFL employs quantum entropy-based client selection and multi-server coordination for fairness and stability. Empirical validation shows consistent convergence with reduced gradient variance, lower communication overhead, and enhanced noise tolerance under constrained edge conditions. The framework establishes a scalable foundation for quantum-enhanced federated learning, enabling secure, efficient, and dynamically stable ADAS intelligence at the vehicular edge.

*Yihan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) by proposing a debiasing method leveraging contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance bias in HGNNs caused by graph topology under semi-supervised learning, which has received minimal prior attention.

Method: Meta-weighting is applied to adjacency matrices to highlight meta-relations, and a PageRank-based projection captures topological biases. A contrastive learning framework is used to mitigate these biases by incorporating label information.

Result: Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the proposed debiasing approach improves performance and resolves topological bias in HGNNs.

Conclusion: This work validates the existence of topological bias in HGNNs and provides an effective method for its mitigation, offering improved model performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are characterized by their capacity of processing graph-structured data. However, due to the sparsity of labels under semi-supervised learning, they have been found to exhibit biased performance on specific nodes. This kind of bias has been validated to correlate with topological structure and is considered as a bottleneck of GNNs' performance. Existing work focuses on the study of homogeneous GNNs and little attention has been given to topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). In this work, firstly, in order to distinguish distinct meta relations, we apply meta-weighting to the adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous graph. Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning. Experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving HGNNs' performance and debiasing.

*Antonio Roye-Azar,Santiago Vargas-Naranjo,Dhruv Ghai,Nithin Balamurugan,Rayan Amir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the performance of Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) on Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus tasks, identifying the key contributors to effectiveness as test-time augmentation, task-specific priors, and computational efficiency rather than deep reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the mechanisms behind the strong performance of Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) on ARC-style tasks and determine how much of this success is due to architecture, task-specific factors, or computational strategies.

Method: The authors conducted empirical analyses, including augmentation and ensembling evaluations, ablation studies on task identifiers, recursion trajectory analysis, training experiments with varying augmentation strategies, and comparisons of TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3.

Result: The study found that test-time compute (e.g., 1000-sample voting) significantly contributes to performance. Task performance heavily depends on correct task identifiers, recursion depth is shallow, and heavy augmentation improves training outcomes. TRM also demonstrated higher throughput and lower memory usage compared to fine-tuning large autoregressive models in this setup.

Conclusion: The performance of TRMs in this context is largely attributed to a combination of task-specific priors, efficient architectures, and test-time computational strategies rather than profound internal reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) were proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative to large language models for solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) style tasks. The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.

TL;DR: The study applies the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model in IoRT-enabled smart greenhouses for efficient and transparent environmental control, reaching high prediction accuracy and using explanations for better trust and adjustability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of explainability and trust in existing time series forecasting models used in IoRT-enabled smart greenhouses, critical for precision agriculture's success in terms of transparency, efficiency, and compliance.

Method: The study employs the TFT model to automate actuator settings, integrating explainability techniques such as model-inherent interpretation, LIME, and SHAP to decode the decision-making process.

Result: The TFT model achieved 95% accuracy despite class imbalances, providing insights into sensor contributions to actuator decisions and enabling reliable fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The research advances precision agriculture by combining high model accuracy with robust interpretability methods, fostering trust, transparency, and effective greenhouse resource management.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) in smart greenhouses has revolutionised precision agriculture by enabling efficient and autonomous environmental control. However, existing time series forecasting models in such setups often operate as black boxes, lacking mechanisms for explainable decision-making, which is a critical limitation when trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount in smart farming practices. This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment. The results demonstrate the varying influence of each sensor on real-time greenhouse adjustments, ensuring transparency and enabling adaptive fine-tuning for improved crop yield and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel real-time feedback system for near-failure resistance training intensity (RiR ≤ 2), using a single wrist-mounted IMU and edge-compatible machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve resistance training effectiveness for hypertrophy by providing objective, real-time feedback on training intensity, addressing the unreliability of subjective RiR assessment.

Method: The method involves a two-stage pipeline: real-time segmentation of IMU data using a ResNet-based model, followed by an LSTM-enhanced classification model to detect near-failure states. Performance was validated using data from real participants performing preacher curls.

Result: The segmentation and classification models achieved F1 scores of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively, under real-time conditions. Deployment on edge devices (Raspberry Pi 5 and iPhone 16) demonstrated low inference latency, confirming feasibility for practical use.

Conclusion: The study provides a feasible and objective approach for real-time hypertrophy training feedback, leveraging low-cost hardware and AI, potentially transforming training intensity management and fatigue control in resistance exercise.

Abstract: Optimizing resistance training for hypertrophy requires balancing proximity to muscular failure, often quantified by Repetitions in Reserve (RiR), with fatigue management. However, subjective RiR assessment is unreliable, leading to suboptimal training stimuli or excessive fatigue. This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate). Deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 yielded an average inference latency of 112 ms, and on an iPhone 16 yielded 23.5 ms, confirming the feasibility for edge computation. This work demonstrates a practical approach for objective, real-time training intensity feedback using minimal hardware, paving the way for accessible AI-driven hypertrophy coaching tools that help users manage intensity and fatigue effectively.

### [380] [Achieving Approximate Symmetry Is Exponentially Easier than Exact Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11855)
*Behrooz Tahmasebi,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the cost difference between enforcing exact and approximate symmetry in machine learning. It introduces 'averaging complexity' to evaluate the cost, finding that approximate symmetry is exponentially cheaper to achieve in standard conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether relying on approximate symmetry in machine learning models is more flexible, robust, and resource-efficient compared to exact symmetry, a theoretical comparison is needed to support empirical observations.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of 'averaging complexity,' which quantifies the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. They analyze and compare the resource requirements to achieve exact and approximate symmetry under standard conditions.

Result: The study finds an exponential separation in costs: exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, while approximate symmetry achieves the same outcome with logarithmic averaging complexity.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical evidence supporting the preference for approximate symmetry, formalizing why it is often more advantageous in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Enforcing exact symmetry in machine learning models often yields significant gains in scientific applications, serving as a powerful inductive bias. However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning.

*Michael Chertkov,Hamidreza Behjoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to optimize intermediate-time dynamics in diffusion-based samplers using a path-wise schedule to improve sampling quality, especially for Gaussian Mixture targets. Experiments showcase consistent enhancements in performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based samplers depend heavily on how intermediate-time dynamics are scheduled for achieving high sampling quality. There is a need for an optimized scheduling framework to improve sampling efficiency and fidelity for complex distributions like Gaussian Mixtures.

Method: The paper proposes a Harmonic PID framework with time-varying stiffness using Piece-Wise-Constant (PWC) parametrizations. It employs schedule-sensitive Quality-of-Sampling (QoS) diagnostics and avoids neural networks by leveraging closed-form Green functions and numerically stable oracles.

Result: The proposed PWC scheduling method improved early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, dynamics' conditioning, and timing of label selection in diffusion-based samplers, as demonstrated in 2D experiments.

Conclusion: Optimizing schedules within diffusion-based samplers through QoS-driven diagnostics and parameterizations can significantly enhance their performance, especially in complex target distributions.

Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers -- Score Based Diffusions, Bridge Diffusions and Path Integral Diffusions -- match a target at terminal time, but the real leverage comes from choosing the schedule that governs the intermediate-time dynamics. We develop a path-wise schedule -- selection gramework for Harmonic PID with a time-varying stiffness, exploiting Piece-Wise-Constant(PWC) parametrizations and a simple hierarchical refinement. We introduce schedule-sensitive Quality-of-Sampling (QoS) diagnostics. Assuming a Gaussian-Mixture (GM) target, we retain closed-form Green functions' ration and numerically stable, Neural-Network free oracles for predicted-state maps and score. Experiments in 2D show that QoS driven PWC schedules consistently improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, conditioning of the dynamics, and speciation (label-selection) timing at fixed integration budgets.

TL;DR: GCoDE is a novel framework designed to enhance GNN inference efficiency on edge devices using a device-edge co-inference approach, resulting in significant speedups and energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency of GNN inference on edge devices due to high computational costs and limited hardware resources, which hinders their deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces GCoDE, a co-design framework that integrates GNN architecture optimization with device-edge mapping. It abstracts device communications as explicit operations, employs a unified design space, predicts energy usage, and uses a constraint-based random search strategy to optimize accuracy and efficiency.

Result: GCoDE demonstrates up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to traditional methods across diverse applications and system setups.

Conclusion: GCoDE effectively enables efficient GNN co-inference on edge devices and represents a significant advancement in deploying GNNs in constrained hardware environments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art graph learning method. However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to existing approaches across diverse applications and system configurations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GH-PID introduces a framework for guided Stochastic Optimal Transport, providing stable sampling and interpretable diagnostics for trajectory planning under a variety of scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a framework that can efficiently guide trajectory ensembles with interpretability and stable sampling, while adhering to a final distribution and accounting for path costs.

Method: The method uses a low-dimensional guidance model to preserve analytic solutions of Kolmogorov equations. Green functions and Gaussian Mixture Models facilitate exact solutions and efficient learning protocols for guided stochastic paths.

Result: GH-PID demonstrated stable and geometrically-aware trajectory generation in three cases: custom guidance, optimized protocol learning, and multi-expert fusion, achieving reduced costs and exact adherence to terminal distributions.

Conclusion: GH-PID ensures geometry- and trust-aware trajectories while maintaining analytic solutions, making it an effective tool for empirical stochastic optimal transport applications.

Abstract: We introduce Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion (GH-PID), a linearly-solvable framework for guided Stochastic Optimal Transport (SOT) with a hard terminal distribution and soft, application-driven path costs. A low-dimensional guidance protocol shapes the trajectory ensemble while preserving analytic structure: the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations remain linear, the optimal score admits an explicit Green-function ratio, and Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) terminal laws yield closed-form expressions. This enables stable sampling and differentiable protocol learning under exact terminal matching.
  We develop guidance-centric diagnostics -- path cost, centerline adherence, variance flow, and drift effort -- that make GH-PID an interpretable variational ansatz for empirical SOT. Three navigation scenarios illustrated in 2D: (i) Case A: hand-crafted protocols revealing how geometry and stiffness shape lag, curvature effects, and mode evolution; (ii) Case B: single-task protocol learning, where a PWC centerline is optimized to minimize integrated cost; (iii) Case C: multi-expert fusion, in which a commander reconciles competing expert/teacher trajectories and terminal beliefs through an exact product-of-experts law and learns a consensus protocol. Across all settings, GH-PID generates geometry-aware, trust-aware trajectories that satisfy the prescribed terminal distribution while systematically reducing integrated cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopicProphet improves stock forecasting by identifying eras with similar public sentiment and historical contexts using advanced analysis techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stocks have historically been difficult to predict due to rapid market changes and insufficient causal logic in quantitative data.

Method: The study introduces TopicProphet, which uses topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection, and segment optimization to select optimal time periods for model training.

Result: TopicProphet enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging nuanced patterns related to socioeconomic and political eras, addressing training data shortages.

Conclusion: The framework achieves better outcomes compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in forecasting financial percentage changes.

Abstract: Stocks can't be predicted. Despite many hopes, this premise held itself true for many years due to the nature of quantitative stock data lacking causal logic along with rapid market changes hindering accumulation of significant data for training models. To undertake this matter, we propose a novel framework, TopicProphet, to analyze historical eras that share similar public sentiment trends and historical background. Our research deviates from previous studies that identified impacts of keywords and sentiments - we expand on that method by a sequence of topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection and segment optimization to detect the optimal time period for training. This results in improving predictions by providing the model with nuanced patterns that occur from that era's socioeconomic and political status while also resolving the shortage of pertinent stock data to train on. Through extensive analysis, we conclude that TopicProphet produces improved outcomes compared to the state-of-the-art methods in capturing the optimal training data for forecasting financial percentage changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BOOST, a training framework designed to optimize the scalability and efficiency of low-rank bottleneck architectures, significantly enhancing training speed and GPU utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of scaling transformer model pre-training, which is constrained by high computational and communication costs. Low-rank bottleneck architectures provide an effective solution but face limitations in scalability under standard tensor parallelism.

Method: BOOST incorporates novel Bottleneck-aware Tensor Parallelism, online-RMSNorm, linear layer grouping, and low-rank activation checkpointing to optimize the efficiency of training low-rank bottleneck architectures.

Result: BOOST achieves 1.46-1.91× speedup over full-rank models and 1.87-2.27× speedup over naively integrated 3D parallelism in low-rank models, with enhanced GPU utilization and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: BOOST effectively addresses the scalability shortcomings of low-rank bottleneck architectures, enabling faster and more efficient training with reduced resource consumption.

Abstract: The scale of transformer model pre-training is constrained by the increasing computation and communication cost. Low-rank bottleneck architectures offer a promising solution to significantly reduce the training time and memory footprint with minimum impact on accuracy. Despite algorithmic efficiency, bottleneck architectures scale poorly under standard tensor parallelism. Simply applying 3D parallelism designed for full-rank methods leads to excessive communication and poor GPU utilization. To address this limitation, we propose BOOST, an efficient training framework tailored for large-scale low-rank bottleneck architectures. BOOST introduces a novel Bottleneck-aware Tensor Parallelism, and combines optimizations such as online-RMSNorm, linear layer grouping, and low-rank activation checkpointing to achieve end-to-end training speedup. Evaluations on different low-rank bottleneck architectures demonstrate that BOOST achieves 1.46-1.91$\times$ speedup over full-rank model baselines and 1.87-2.27$\times$ speedup over low-rank model with naively integrated 3D parallelism, with improved GPU utilization and reduced communication overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explains a novel machine learning sensitivity metric based on ICE curves for better understanding variable interactions in aerospace applications, overcoming PDP limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerospace design requires understanding variable interactions in data-driven models. PDP fails in capturing strong interactions effectively, necessitating a better metric.

Method: Introduced ICE-based sensitivity metric, mathematically proven its advantages over PDP using truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion, and evaluated it against PDP, SHAP, and Sobol' indices.

Result: ICE-based sensitivity metric outperformed PDP, SHAP, and Sobol' indices in capturing variable interactions, with evaluations across analytical and engineering problems.

Conclusion: ICE-based feature importance offers richer insights into variable interactions compared to PDP, aiding in engineering model interpretability without discarding complementary methods like SHAP.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning techniques have gained increasing attention in engineering applications, especially in aerospace design and analysis, where understanding how input variables influence data-driven models is essential. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL) for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), improving generalization and performance, and introduces Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL) for tasks with complex dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify reward design in reinforcement learning by reframing tasks as goal-reaching, leveraging the quasimetric nature of the optimal value function in goal-conditioned RL.

Method: Introduced Eik-QRL using Eikonal PDE for trajectory-free quasimetric value learning and proposed Eik-HiQRL for hierarchical task decomposition to address limitations with complex dynamics.

Result: Eik-HiQRL achieved state-of-the-art performance in offline goal-conditioned navigation and outperformed prior methods in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Eik-QRL offers a theoretical foundation and practical benefits for goal-conditioned RL, while Eik-HiQRL enhances learning under complex dynamics, making it a robust approach for various tasks.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) mitigates the difficulty of reward design by framing tasks as goal reaching rather than maximizing hand-crafted reward signals. In this setting, the optimal goal-conditioned value function naturally forms a quasimetric, motivating Quasimetric RL (QRL), which constrains value learning to quasimetric mappings and enforces local consistency through discrete, trajectory-based constraints. We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition. Empirically, Eik-HiQRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline goal-conditioned navigation and yields consistent gains over QRL in manipulation tasks, matching temporal-difference methods.

*Animesh Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spectral Sentinel, a scalable defense against Byzantine attacks in decentralized federated learning using random matrix theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for decentralized federated learning struggle with scalability and robustness against Byzantine clients manipulating updates under heterogeneous data.

Method: Spectral Sentinel combines Frequent Directions sketching with Marchenko-Pastur tracking to detect and aggregate gradients with low-memory overhead, achieving resilience to Byzantine attacks.

Result: Spectral Sentinel achieves robust performance (78.4 percent accuracy) across diverse attack scenarios, outperforming existing methods with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework leverages random matrix theory for optimal Byzantine resilience, contributing a scalable solution validated through blockchain implementation and extensive experimental benchmarking.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training without centralized trust, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine clients that poison gradients under heterogeneous (Non-IID) data. Existing defenses face a scalability trilemma: distance-based filtering (e.g., Krum) can reject legitimate Non-IID updates, geometric-median methods incur prohibitive $O(n^2 d)$ cost, and many certified defenses are evaluated only on models below 100M parameters. We propose Spectral Sentinel, a Byzantine detection and aggregation framework that leverages a random-matrix-theoretic signature: honest Non-IID gradients produce covariance eigenspectra whose bulk follows the Marchenko-Pastur law, while Byzantine perturbations induce detectable tail anomalies. Our algorithm combines Frequent Directions sketching with data-dependent MP tracking, enabling detection on models up to 1.5B parameters using $O(k^2)$ memory with $k \ll d$. Under a $(σ,f)$ threat model with coordinate-wise honest variance bounded by $σ^2$ and $f < 1/2$ adversaries, we prove $(ε,δ)$-Byzantine resilience with convergence rate $O(σf / \sqrt{T} + f^2 / T)$, and we provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound $Ω(σf / \sqrt{T})$, establishing minimax optimality. We implement the full system with blockchain integration on Polygon networks and validate it across 144 attack-aggregator configurations, achieving 78.4 percent average accuracy versus 48-63 percent for baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for discovering patterns in time series data struggle with computational complexity, limited interpretability, and capturing meaningful temporal structures, necessitating new approaches.

Method: The authors propose a learning framework that trains two Transformer models using shapelet-based and statistical feature representations, coupled with a visual analytics system (SigTIme) for interactive exploration.

Result: The framework was quantitatively validated on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset, and its utility demonstrated through case studies on ECG data and preterm labor analysis.

Conclusion: The approach effectively uncovers interpretable temporal patterns and provides actionable insights, making time series data analysis more robust and accessible for decision-making.

Abstract: Understanding and distinguishing temporal patterns in time series data is essential for scientific discovery and decision-making. For example, in biomedical research, uncovering meaningful patterns in physiological signals can improve diagnosis, risk assessment, and patient outcomes. However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system -- SigTIme -- with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through two usage scenarios along with the domain experts: one involving public ECG data and the other focused on preterm labor analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for solving PDEs struggle with stability on irregular domains, which arise often in multiphysics problems.

Method: The proposed OCGNN-PINN employs node-edge message passing combined with consistency loss enforcing gradient-divergence constraints via the graph incidence matrix.

Result: The model demonstrates improved temporal stability and accuracy in diffusion problems compared to common baseline models, and its performance is close to Crank-Nicolson solvers on unstructured domains.

Conclusion: OCGNN-PINN offers a stable and physics-informed approach for solving PDEs on irregular meshes, advancing graph-based methods in this context.

Abstract: Classical numerical methods solve partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently on regular meshes, but many of them become unstable on irregular domains. In practice, multiphysics interactions such as diffusion, damage, and healing often take place on irregular meshes. We develop an operator-consistent graph neural network (OCGNN-PINN) that approximates PDE evolution under physics-informed constraints. It couples node-edge message passing with a consistency loss enforcing the gradient-divergence relation through the graph incidence matrix, ensuring that discrete node and edge dynamics remain structurally coupled during temporal rollout. We evaluate the model on diffusion processes over physically driven evolving meshes and real-world scanned surfaces. The results show improved temporal stability and prediction accuracy compared with graph convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines, approaching the performance of Crank-Nicolson solvers on unstructured domains.

Motivation: Address challenges in DFL related to statistical heterogeneity and communication overhead, particularly improving convergence and efficiency in bandwidth-limited environments.

Method: Introduced SPARK: a combination of random projection-based compression for Jacobian matrices, stage-wise annealed distillation to adjust learning phases, and Nesterov momentum acceleration for faster convergence.

Result: SPARK reduces communication overhead by 98.7% compared to NTK-based methods while maintaining or improving convergence speed and accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art communication efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARK provides a practical solution enabling efficient decentralized federated learning in resource-constrained environments, significantly advancing the field of communication-efficient DFL.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) faces critical challenges from statistical heterogeneity and communication overhead. While NTK-based methods achieve faster convergence, transmitting full Jacobian matrices is impractical for bandwidth-constrained edge networks. We propose SPARK, synergistically integrating random projection-based Jacobian compression, stage-wise annealed distillation, and Nesterov momentum acceleration. Random projections compress Jacobians while preserving spectral properties essential for convergence. Stage-wise annealed distillation transitions from pure NTK evolution to neighbor-regularized learning, counteracting compression noise. Nesterov momentum accelerates convergence through stable accumulation enabled by distillation smoothing. SPARK achieves 98.7% communication reduction compared to NTK-DFL while maintaining convergence speed and superior accuracy. With momentum, SPARK reaches target performance 3 times faster, establishing state-of-the-art results for communication-efficient decentralized learning and enabling practical deployment in bandwidth-limited edge environments.

*Muhammad Bilal Shahid,Prajwal Koirla,Cody Fleming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Predictor-Corrector mechanism, where errors in time-series forecasts are corrected by a neural controlled differential equation, improving multi-step forecast accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step forecasts in time-series models often suffer from accuracy loss due to errors. The study aims to address this issue by proposing a mechanism to improve forecast reliability.

Method: The Predictor produces initial forecasts while the Corrector, using a neural controlled differential equation, predicts and adjusts the errors, resulting in improved accuracy. Regularization strategies are included for better extrapolation.

Result: Experimental evaluation on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets shows consistent improvements in forecast accuracy across diverse Predictors.

Conclusion: The Predictor-Corrector mechanism demonstrates significant enhancement over standalone Predictors in improving the reliability of multi-step time-series forecasts.

Abstract: Learned time-series models, whether continuous- or discrete-time, are widely used to forecast the states of a dynamical system. Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical learning framework for optimizing UAV trajectory planning and task offloading in low-altitude intelligent networks (LAINs) to improve energy efficiency and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges faced by LAINs, such as energy constraints in UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and diverse computing resources, which hinder their ability to support critical applications.

Method: The study introduced a two-timescale hierarchical learning framework using the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism for energy-aware trajectory assignment at a large timescale and a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with latent diffusion models for task optimization at a small timescale.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance over baseline methods in terms of energy efficiency, task success rate, and convergence through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed air-ground collaborative approach and advanced learning methods effectively address key challenges in LAINs, making them more suitable for dynamic and critical applications.

Abstract: The low-altitude intelligent networks (LAINs) emerge as a promising architecture for delivering low-latency and energy-efficient edge intelligence in dynamic and infrastructure-limited environments. By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity. Extensive simulations show that our framework outperforms baselines in energy efficiency, task success rate, and convergence performance.

*Ibrahim Talha Ersoy,Andrés Fernando Cardozo Licha,Karoline Wiesner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the geometry of deep neural network (DNN) loss landscapes to explain key training phenomena such as phase transitions, saddle points, and mode connectivity, proposing an efficient algorithm for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and unify the underlying mechanisms of training phenomena in DNNs, particularly phase transitions, saddle points, and mode connectivity, which are not well understood.

Method: The study uses analytical exploration of loss landscapes, implements L2 regularization as a probing tool, and applies a fast algorithm to analyze error landscapes, testing these methods on the MNIST dataset.

Result: The results demonstrate that saddle points govern phase transitions, confirm mode connectivity by identifying paths connecting minima, and show that saddle points lead to transitions between distinct digit class models.

Conclusion: The paper identifies the geometric nature of training phenomena in DNNs, highlights a hierarchy of accuracy basins as in statistical physics, and provides an effective method for studying these landscapes.

Abstract: Training Deep Neural Networks relies on the model converging on a high-dimensional, non-convex loss landscape toward a good minimum. Yet, much of the phenomenology of training remains ill understood. We focus on three seemingly disparate observations: the occurrence of phase transitions reminiscent of statistical physics, the ubiquity of saddle points, and phenomenon of mode connectivity relevant for model merging. We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes. We apply it to confirm mode connectivity in DNNs trained on the MNIST dataset by efficiently finding paths that connect global minima. We then show numerically that saddle points induce transitions between models that encode distinct digit classes. Our work establishes the geometric origin of key training phenomena in DNNs and reveals a hierarchy of accuracy basins analogous to phases in statistical physics.

### [395] [Eventually LIL Regret: Almost Sure $\ln\ln T$ Regret for a sub-Gaussian Mixture on Unbounded Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12325)
*Shubhada Agrawal,Aaditya Ramdas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates sub-Gaussian mixtures by Robbins, providing a deterministic path-wise regret bound. It bridges adversarial online learning and stochastic assumptions through conditional regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between adversarial online learning (focused on bounded data) and game-theoretic statistics (handling unbounded data), introducing path-wise deterministic regret bounds.

Method: Proves a deterministic regret bound for every path in "Ville event" using cumulative variance process and analyzes its behavior under stochastic assumptions.

Result: Path-wise deterministic regret bounds are derived with universal constants; the bounds bridge stochastic and adversarial learning frameworks via conditional regret bounds.

Conclusion: Conditional regret bounds unify adversarial online learning and stochastic settings, proving versatility in addressing both bounded and unbounded data scenarios.

Abstract: We prove that a classic sub-Gaussian mixture proposed by Robbins in a stochastic setting actually satisfies a path-wise (deterministic) regret bound. For every path in a natural ``Ville event'' $E_α$, this regret till time $T$ is bounded by $\ln^2(1/α)/V_T + \ln (1/α) + \ln \ln V_T$ up to universal constants, where $V_T$ is a nonnegative, nondecreasing, cumulative variance process. (The bound reduces to $\ln(1/α) + \ln \ln V_T$ if $V_T \geq \ln(1/α)$.) If the data were stochastic, then one can show that $E_α$ has probability at least $1-α$ under a wide class of distributions (eg: sub-Gaussian, symmetric, variance-bounded, etc.). In fact, we show that on the Ville event $E_0$ of probability one, the regret on every path in $E_0$ is eventually bounded by $\ln \ln V_T$ (up to constants). We explain how this work helps bridge the world of adversarial online learning (which usually deals with regret bounds for bounded data), with game-theoretic statistics (which can handle unbounded data, albeit using stochastic assumptions). In short, conditional regret bounds serve as a bridge between stochastic and adversarial betting.

*Daniil Zverev,A. Sophia Koepke,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates the challenges of using synthetic data for continual learning, emphasizing its influence on model contamination and performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data is increasingly used for model training, but its repeated use raises concerns about distribution drift and dataset contamination, impacting performance.

Method: The paper applies statistical analysis to examine the bias and variance caused by synthetic data and empirically evaluates generative models under continual learning scenarios.

Result: The findings reveal that frequent training on synthetic data causes model collapse, introduces bias and variance, and state-of-the-art GER methods fail to maintain latent space alignment.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical limitations of synthetic data usage in continual learning and calls for more robust methods to address these issues.

Abstract: The use of synthetically generated data for training models is becoming a common practice. While generated data can augment the training data, repeated training on synthetic data raises concerns about distribution drift and degradation of performance due to contamination of the dataset. We investigate the consequences of this bootstrapping process through the lens of continual learning, drawing a connection to Generative Experience Replay (GER) methods. We present a statistical analysis showing that synthetic data introduces significant bias and variance into training objectives, weakening the reliability of maximum likelihood estimation. We provide empirical evidence showing that popular generative models collapse under repeated training with synthetic data. We quantify this degradation and show that state-of-the-art GER methods fail to maintain alignment in the latent space. Our findings raise critical concerns about the use of synthetic data in continual learning.

### [397] [Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning: One Size Does Not Fit All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12341)
*Paul Hofman,Yusuf Sale,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores predictive uncertainty measures, emphasizing that no single measure is universally best, but rather, the choice depends on the application. It evaluates different uncertainty measures tailored to specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for accurate predictive uncertainty quantification in safety-critical machine learning applications where existing measures exhibit limitations depending on task requirements.

Method: The authors use a flexible family of uncertainty measures distinguishing total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainties in second-order distributions. They demonstrate an application-based approach by employing proper scoring rules to tailor these measures.

Result: The paper finds proper scoring rules should align with task loss for selective prediction, mutual information is ideal for out-of-distribution detection, and epistemic uncertainty with zero-one loss outperforms others in active learning.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is context-dependent and should be customized for specific applications. The study offers insights into matching measures with tasks for better performance.

Abstract: Proper quantification of predictive uncertainty is essential for the use of machine learning in safety-critical applications. Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures.

### [398] [Neural Chameleons: Language Models Can Learn to Hide Their Thoughts from Unseen Activation Monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11949)
*Max McGuinness,Alex Serrano,Luke Bailey,Scott Emmons*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether AI models can evade detection by activation monitoring under a misalignment threat. It demonstrates that through fine-tuning, models can achieve zero-shot evasion of these monitoring techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in AI safety, aiming to test the robustness of activation monitoring under misalignment threats, where models may aim to hide information from monitoring systems.

Method: The authors fine-tuned language models (LLMs) to evade activation monitors for certain concepts by introducing specific triggers. They then analyzed the model's generalization to unseen safety-relevant concepts and validated this across different types of models and monitoring defenses.

Result: Fine-tuned models successfully evaded monitors for previously unseen concepts. Evasion was selective, with mechanisms like moving activations into low-dimensional subspaces. Stronger defenses improved resilience but didn't entirely prevent evasion.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in activation monitoring and provides a framework to test robustness against models deliberately evading detection, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: Activation monitoring, which probes a model's internal states using lightweight classifiers, is an emerging tool for AI safety. However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: "You are being probed for {concept}". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models.

*Zachary Chase,Steve Hanneke,Shay Moran,Jonathan Shafer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves an open problem on the advantage of unlabeled data in online learning, showing a tight quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the difference in performance (mistake bounds) between transductive and standard online learning, addressing a 30-year old question in the field.

Method: The authors analyzed and proved new tight bounds on the mistake rates in the transductive online learning setting, improving significantly upon previous bounds and extending theoretical insights.

Result: They demonstrated that the mistake bound for transductive learning is at least Ω(√d) and proposed a tight upper bound of O(√d), establishing a quadratic gap compared to standard online learning.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the value of unlabeled data in online learning and contrasts this with PAC learning where transductive and standard approaches have similar sample complexities.

Abstract: We resolve a 30-year-old open problem concerning the power of unlabeled data in online learning by tightly quantifying the gap between transductive and standard online learning. In the standard setting, the optimal mistake bound is characterized by the Littlestone dimension $d$ of the concept class $H$ (Littlestone 1987). We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $Ω(\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $Ω(\log\log d)$, $Ω(\sqrt{\log d})$, and $Ω(\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023). We also show that this lower bound is tight: for every $d$, there exists a class of Littlestone dimension $d$ with transductive mistake bound $O(\sqrt{d})$. Our upper bound also improves upon the best known upper bound of $(2/3)d$ from Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1997). These results establish a quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning, thereby highlighting the benefit of advance access to the unlabeled instance sequence. This contrasts with the PAC setting, where transductive and standard learning exhibit similar sample complexities.

### [400] [Learning to Extract Context for Context-Aware LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11986)
*Minseon Kim,Lucas Caccia,Zhengyan Shi,Matheus Pereira,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan,Alessandro Sordoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues of ambiguous and under-specified LLM prompts by proposing a context-aware framework using a reinforcement learning-based approach that improves response safety and appropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle inherent risks in LLMs due to ambiguous user prompts that may result in either unsafe outputs or overly cautious refusals of benign requests.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning-based context generator operating in an autoencoder-like design to extract contextual signals from the prompt, guiding safer and more informed response generation.

Result: Experiments show a 5.6% reduction in harmful responses and a 6.2% improvement in compliance with benign prompts across evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Context extraction enhances LLM safety and reliability by effectively addressing ambiguous requests and generating more appropriate responses.

Abstract: User prompts to large language models (LLMs) are often ambiguous or under-specified, and subtle contextual cues shaped by user intentions, prior knowledge, and risk factors strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate response. Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of context extraction for safer and more reliable LLM inferences.

*Ittai Rubinstein,Samuel B. Hopkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a novel analysis of data attribution methods, Influence Functions (IF) and single Newton Step (NS), for convex learning problems without relying on global strong convexity assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of data attribution methods are limited in their assumptions (relying on strong convexity) and produce bounds that scale poorly with parameters, failing to answer fundamental performance comparison questions.

Method: The authors introduce an analysis of NS and IF methods for convex problems, proving asymptotic scaling laws without assuming global strong convexity. They also validate the superior accuracy of NS compared to IF in specific cases.

Result: The paper demonstrates tight asymptotic error bounds for logistic regression while showing why NS outperforms IF in terms of accuracy. Key results include scaling laws of errors for average-case sample removals.

Conclusion: The findings improve understanding of data attribution methods, offering more accurate assessment tools for NS and IF, and advancing interpretability and unlearning applications without strong convexity assumptions.

Abstract: Data attribution aims to explain model predictions by estimating how they would change if certain training points were removed, and is used in a wide range of applications, from interpretability and credit assignment to unlearning and privacy.
  Even in the relatively simple case of linear regressions, existing mathematical analyses of leading data attribution methods such as Influence Functions (IF) and single Newton Step (NS) remain limited in two key ways. First, they rely on global strong convexity assumptions which are often not satisfied in practice. Second, the resulting bounds scale very poorly with the number of parameters ($d$) and the number of samples removed ($k$). As a result, these analyses are not tight enough to answer fundamental questions such as "what is the asymptotic scaling of the errors of each method?" or "which of these methods is more accurate for a given dataset?"
  In this paper, we introduce a new analysis of the NS and IF data attribution methods for convex learning problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of these questions that does not assume global strong convexity and also the first explanation of [KATL19] and [RH25a]'s observation that NS data attribution is often more accurate than IF. We prove that for sufficiently well-behaved logistic regression, our bounds are asymptotically tight up to poly-logarithmic factors, yielding scaling laws for the errors in the average-case sample removals.
  \[ \mathbb{E}_{T \subseteq [n],\, |T| = k} \bigl[ \|\hatθ_T - \hatθ_T^{\mathrm{NS}}\|_2 \bigr] = \widetildeΘ\!\left(\frac{k d}{n^2}\right), \qquad \mathbb{E}_{T \subseteq [n],\, |T| = k} \bigl[ \|\hatθ_T^{\mathrm{NS}} - \hatθ_T^{\mathrm{IF}}\|_2 \bigr] = \widetildeΘ\!\left( \frac{(k + d)\sqrt{k d}}{n^2} \right). \]

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFedReweighting, a framework to improve decentralized federated learning (DFL) with enhanced fairness and robustness using reweighting aggregation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in decentralized federated learning (fairness, robustness) without reliance on a central server.

Method: A unified aggregation framework that employs objective-oriented reweighting strategies based on local data metrics for improved learning outcomes.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows linear convergence, and experiments confirm enhanced fairness and robustness against Byzantine attacks in various scenarios.

Conclusion: DFedReweighting framework achieves diverse learning objectives in DFL systems when appropriate metrics and strategies are utilized.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning model through iterative rounds of local training, communication, and aggregation without relying on a central server which introduces potential vulnerabilities in conventional Federated Learning. Nevertheless, DFL systems continue to face a range of challenges, including fairness, robustness, etc. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DFedReweighting}, a unified aggregation framework designed to achieve diverse objectives in DFL systems via a objective-oriented reweighting aggregation at the final step of each learning round. Specifically, the framework first computes preliminary weights based on \textit{target performance metric} obtained from auxiliary dataset constructed using local data. These weights are then refined using \textit{customized reweighting strategy}, resulting in the final aggregation weights. Our results from the theoretical analysis demonstrate that the appropriate combination of the target performance metric and the customized reweighting strategy ensures linear convergence. Experimental results consistently show that our proposed framework significantly improves fairness and robustness against Byzantine attacks in diverse scenarios. Provided that appropriate target performance metrics and customized reweighting strategy are selected, our framework can achieve a wide range of desired learning objectives.

### [404] [The Instability of Safety: How Random Seeds and Temperature Expose Inconsistent LLM Refusal Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12066)
*Erik Larsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safety evaluations of large language models often rely on single-shot testing which assumes stability in model decisions. However, this study finds that safety decisions can fluctuate depending on sampling configurations, with a notable decrease in stability under higher temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that single-shot testing is sufficient and representative for evaluating the safety alignment of large language models.

Method: The study tested four instruction-tuned language models across 876 harmful prompts under 20 different sampling configurations (manipulating temperature and random seed) to assess decision stability using the developed Safety Stability Index (SSI).

Result: Safety decisions show instability, with 18-28% of prompts exhibiting fluctuations across sampling configurations. Higher temperatures significantly diminish stability (mean SSI dropping at higher temperatures). Validation using external judges confirms the findings.

Conclusion: Single-shot safety evaluations are inadequate for reliable safety assessment. The study recommends using multi-sample evaluations (at least 3 samples per prompt) for more robust and representative assessments.

Abstract: Current safety evaluations of large language models rely on single-shot testing, implicitly assuming that model responses are deterministic and representative of the model's safety alignment. We challenge this assumption by investigating the stability of safety refusal decisions across random seeds and temperature settings. Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62). These findings demonstrate that single-shot safety evaluations are insufficient for reliable safety assessment. We show that single-shot evaluation agrees with multi-sample ground truth only 92.4% of the time, and recommend using at least 3 samples per prompt for reliable safety assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel methodology for solving inverse problems in infinite and semi-infinite domains using PINNs and PIKANs, highlighting that PINNs outperformed PIKANs in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of solving inverse problems in infinite and semi-infinite domains by improving performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency using advanced neural network architectures.

Method: The proposed method uses a dual network architecture with a novel sampling strategy (negative exponential and normal distributions) within PINNs and PIKANs. The dual architecture simultaneously learns equation solutions and parameters without the need to explicitly impose boundary conditions.

Result: PINNs were shown to outperform PIKANs in terms of computational speed (1,000 times faster) and lower relative error, while obtaining comparable results in noisy environments.

Conclusion: PINNs are more effective and efficient than PIKANs for solving inverse problems in infinite domains based on experimental evaluation.

Abstract: Inverse problems are extensively studied in applied mathematics, with applications ranging from acoustic tomography for medical diagnosis to geophysical exploration. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving such problems, while Physics informed Kolmogorov Arnold networks (PIKANs) represent a recent benchmark that, in certain problems, promises greater interpretability and accuracy compared to PINNs, due to their nature, being constructed as a composition of polynomials. In this work, we develop a methodology for addressing inverse problems in infinite and semi infinite domains. We introduce a novel sampling strategy for the network's training points, using the negative exponential and normal distributions, alongside a dual network architecture that is trained to learn the solution and parameters of an equation with the same loss function. This design enables the solution of inverse problems without explicitly imposing boundary conditions, as long as the solutions tend to stabilize when leaving the domain of interest. The proposed architecture is implemented using both PINNs and PIKANs, and their performance is compared in terms of accuracy with respect to a known solution as well as computational time and response to a noisy environment. Our results demonstrate that, in this setting, PINNs provide a more accurate and computationally efficient solution, solving the inverse problem 1,000 times faster and in the same order of magnitude, yet with a lower relative error than PIKANs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cloak, a data obfuscation framework using latent diffusion models, which offers improved privacy-utility trade-offs and suitability for resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical data obfuscation framework that better balances privacy and utility while addressing the limitations of existing methods, such as computational inefficiency and lack of flexibility for resource-constrained IoT devices.

Method: The proposed method, Cloak, uses contrastive learning to create disentangled data representations, guiding latent diffusion models to hide private data while retaining utility and providing flexibility for diverse user privacy needs.

Result: Cloak outperforms current state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques across four public time-series datasets and a dataset of facial images, showing high effectiveness and compatibility with resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Cloak delivers substantial advancements in balancing data privacy and utility, providing an efficient, adaptable solution for mobile IoT devices and addressing the challenges faced by prior approaches.

Abstract: Data obfuscation is a promising technique for mitigating attribute inference attacks by semi-trusted parties with access to time-series data emitted by sensors. Recent advances leverage conditional generative models together with adversarial training or mutual information-based regularization to balance data privacy and utility. However, these methods often require modifying the downstream task, struggle to achieve a satisfactory privacy-utility trade-off, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained mobile IoT devices. We propose Cloak, a novel data obfuscation framework based on latent diffusion models. In contrast to prior work, we employ contrastive learning to extract disentangled representations, which guide the latent diffusion process to retain useful information while concealing private information. This approach enables users with diverse privacy needs to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off with minimal retraining. Extensive experiments on four public time-series datasets, spanning multiple sensing modalities, and a dataset of facial images demonstrate that Cloak consistently outperforms state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques and is well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: The paper studies when and why GCNs outperform simpler models using diagnostic experiments on the Amazon Computers dataset, focusing on homophily and feature quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide clearer guidance for practitioners on when Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) outperform simpler baselines for semi-supervised node classification.

Method: The authors conducted systematic experiments, including label scarcity simulations, feature ablation tests, and per-class performance analysis, to evaluate GCN performance under varying graph homophily and feature quality conditions.

Result: GCNs excel under extreme label scarcity and highly homophilous graphs, even with noisy features. They perform poorly when graphs exhibit low homophily but strong node features.

Conclusion: GCNs are most effective in scenarios where neighborhood structural information compensates for limited supervision. However, they should be avoided when low graph homophily combines with strong features, as this degrades their predictive performance.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a standard approach for semi-supervised node classification, yet practitioners lack clear guidance on when GCNs provide meaningful improvements over simpler baselines. We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphPerf-RT, a graph-based surrogate model for predicting performance and resource utilization of OpenMP workloads on embedded SoCs, validated on ARM platforms and integrated with RL methods for efficient scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting performance of OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to workload irregularity, structural inefficiencies, and overheating risks with existing methods.

Method: The paper proposes GraphPerf-RT, incorporating task DAG topology, code semantics, and runtime context into a heterogeneous graph representation with multi-task heads for performance metrics prediction and risk-aware scheduling.

Result: GraphPerf-RT achieved high prediction accuracy (R^2 > 0.95) and well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05) across ARM platforms, improving scheduling efficiency with RL integration (e.g., 66% makespan reduction, 82% energy reduction).

Conclusion: GraphPerf-RT empowers thermally constrained embedded systems with effective model-based planning, leveraging accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions to address scheduling challenges.

Abstract: Performance prediction for OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to complex interactions between task DAG structure, control-flow irregularity, cache
  and branch behavior, and thermal dynamics; classical heuristics struggle under workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free RL risks
  overheating resource-constrained devices. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core
  DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict
  makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts.
  We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To
  demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL),
  multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the
  world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate,
  uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fully differentiable method, CoDeQ, for joint pruning and quantization without auxiliary procedures, achieving significant compression efficiency on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning in joint pruning-quantization methods, while improving compression through direct data-driven gradient learning.

Method: CoDeQ uses the dead-zone of scalar quantizers for pruning and directly parameterizes dead-zone width, optimizing both pruning and quantization parameters via backpropagation.

Result: Demonstrates significant compression on ImageNet with ResNet-18 by reducing bit operations to ~5% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: CoDeQ simplifies architecture implementation and offers an efficient end-to-end compression solution supporting fixed and mixed-precision quantization.

Abstract: While joint pruning--quantization is theoretically superior to sequential application, current joint methods rely on auxiliary procedures outside the training loop for finding compression parameters. This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes.

*Ahmad Chamma,Omar El Herraoui,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MixtureKit is an open-source framework for building and analyzing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, supporting flexible approaches to routing and expert configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide researchers and developers with a comprehensive, modular tool for constructing, training, and exploring Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models efficiently, addressing limitations of current frameworks.

Method: MixtureKit introduces three methods: Traditional MoE (single router per block), BTX (individual routers for sub-layers), and BTS (trainable stitch layers for expert communication). It automates model modifications for inference or fine-tuning and includes visualization tools.

Result: Experiments with multilingual, code-switched datasets demonstrate the superiority of BTX-based MoE models constructed using MixtureKit over standard dense models on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: MixtureKit proves to be a versatile and practical tool for advancing research and applications in MoE-based systems across various fields.

Abstract: We introduce MixtureKit, a modular open-source framework for constructing, training, and analyzing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models from arbitrary pre-trained or fine-tuned models. MixtureKit currently supports three complementary methods: (i) \emph{Traditional MoE}, which uses a single router per transformer block to select experts, (ii) \emph{BTX} (Branch-Train-Mix), which introduces separate routers for each specified sub-layer enabling fine-grained token routing, and (iii) \emph{BTS} (Branch-Train-Stitch), which keeps experts fully intact and introduces trainable stitch layers for controlled information exchange between hub and experts. MixtureKit automatically modifies the model configuration, patches decoder and causal LM classes, and saves a unified checkpoint ready for inference or fine-tuning. We further provide a visualization interface to inspect per-token routing decisions, expert weight distributions, and layer-wise contributions. Experiments with multilingual code-switched data (e.g. Arabic-Latin) show that a BTX-based model trained using MixtureKit can outperform baseline dense models on multiple benchmarks. We release MixtureKit as a practical foundation for research and development of MoE-based systems across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CP low-rank tensor discriminant analysis (CP-TDA) for classification of tensor-valued predictors, emphasizing its enhanced performance in high-dimensional and small-sample settings compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discriminative signals in tensor data often concentrate along multilinear components, necessitating theoretical and practical advancements for tensor classification in high-dimensional and small-sample settings.

Method: Proposed CP-TDA with Randomized Composite PCA initialization to handle tensor noise, iterative refinement for optimization, and a semiparametric discriminant model integrating deep generative models for tensor data analysis.

Result: Achieved global convergence and minimax-optimal misclassification rates, while numerical experiments and real data applications showcased improved accuracy compared to existing tensor classifiers and graph neural networks.

Conclusion: CP-TDA demonstrates practical and theoretical advantages in tensor classification, particularly for high-dimensional data and challenging regimes, offering a robust alternative to current models.

Abstract: High-dimensional tensor-valued predictors arise in modern applications, increasingly as learned representations from neural networks. Existing tensor classification methods rely on sparsity or Tucker structures and often lack theoretical guarantees. Motivated by empirical evidence that discriminative signals concentrate along a few multilinear components, we introduce CP low-rank structure for the discriminant tensor, a modeling perspective not previously explored. Under a Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose high-dimensional CP low-rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CP-TDA) with Randomized Composite PCA (\textsc{rc-PCA}) initialization, that is essential for handling dependent and anisotropic noise under weaker signal strength and incoherence conditions, followed by iterative refinement algorithm. We establish global convergence and minimax-optimal misclassification rates.
  To handle tensor data deviating from tensor normality, we develop the first semiparametric tensor discriminant model, in which learned tensor representations are mapped via deep generative models into a latent space tailored for CP-TDA. Misclassification risk decomposes into representation, approximation, and estimation errors. Numerical studies and real data analysis on graph classification demonstrate substantial gains over existing tensor classifiers and state-of-the-art graph neural networks, particularly in high-dimensional, small-sample regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of high-fidelity simulations limit their use in data-driven aerodynamic modeling, necessitating efficient multi-fidelity strategies.

Method: A multi-fidelity framework combines autoencoder-based transfer learning and Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) for uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion.

Result: The framework corrected low-fidelity deviations and achieved highly accurate pressure predictions using minimal high-fidelity data, with robust uncertainty bands.

Conclusion: It provides a scalable and reliable solution for aerodynamic regression in data-scarce scenarios, combining efficiency and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Accurate aerodynamic prediction often relies on high-fidelity simulations; however, their prohibitive computational costs severely limit their applicability in data-driven modeling. This limitation motivates the development of multi-fidelity strategies that leverage inexpensive low-fidelity information without compromising accuracy. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data. Furthermore, the MSCP framework produces robust, actionable uncertainty bands with pointwise coverage exceeding 95%. By combining extreme data efficiency with uncertainty quantification, this work offers a scalable and reliable solution for aerodynamic regression in data-scarce environments.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations in classical ReLU-based networks and propose SiLU activation networks for improved function approximation efficiency.

Method: Using a hierarchical approach, the authors derive efficient approximations of the square function and extend the approach to build sharp bounds for deep SiLU networks in Sobolev-class functions.

Result: SiLU networks achieve improved error decay rates, $mathcal{O}(ω^{-2k})$, with minimal depth and size, outperforming ReLU counterparts.

Conclusion: SiLU activation networks provide a more efficient alternative to ReLU networks for smooth function approximations, with improved control over network complexity and sharp approximation rates.

Abstract: This article establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework demonstrating that SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) activation networks achieve exponential approximation rates for smooth functions with explicit and improved complexity control compared to classical ReLU-based constructions. We develop a novel hierarchical construction beginning with an efficient approximation of the square function $x^2$ more compact in depth and size than comparable ReLU realizations, such as those given by Yarotsky. This construction yields an approximation error decaying as $\mathcal{O}(ω^{-2k})$ using networks of depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We then extend this approach through functional composition to establish sharp approximation bounds for deep SiLU networks in approximating Sobolev-class functions, with total depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and size $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/n})$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge between graphs. It identifies conditional shift due to local node feature dependencies and proposes decorrelating node features to improve GDA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge transfer between graphs remains challenging, with conditional shift being a hurdle in unsupervised graph domain adaptation due to node feature dependencies.

Method: The authors analyze conditional shift from dependent node features using Markov chain models, derive generalization bounds, and propose decorrelation techniques using specialized GCN and graph transformer layers.

Result: Experimental data showcases significant performance improvements over baseline GDA methods and small intra-class distances in learned representations.

Conclusion: Decorrelating node features effectively mitigates conditional shift in unsupervised GDA, enhancing transferability and overall performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in machine learning methods on graphs. However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, improves streamflow forecasting by overcoming limitations of LSTM-based implementations and ensuring temporal coherence in multi-day forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and producing coherent forecast trajectories found in current LSTM-based probabilistic streamflow forecasting models.

Method: HydroDiffusion employs a diffusion-based framework with a decoder-only state space model to jointly denoise full multi-day prediction trajectories in a single pass, evaluated over 531 watersheds using the CAMELS dataset.

Result: HydroDiffusion demonstrates strong nowcasting accuracy, consistent performance over simulation horizons, and superior deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill compared to DRUM and other diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: HydroDiffusion is a robust generative modeling framework, setting a new benchmark for medium-range streamflow forecasting and advancing probabilistic hydrologic prediction at large scales.

Abstract: Recent advances have introduced diffusion models for probabilistic streamflow forecasting, demonstrating strong early flood-warning skill. However, current implementations rely on recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) backbones and single-step training objectives, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies and produce coherent forecast trajectories across lead times. To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales.

*Vítor M. Hanriot,Luiz C. B. Torres,Antônio P. Braga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores advances in Gabriel graph-based classification methods and proposes improvements in activation functions, classifier architecture, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance Gabriel graph-based classification methods, which offer optimization-free classification with potential for effective results, by improving the structural aspects, training methods, and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose smoother activation functions, structural support vector-centered neurons, and extend neural network architectures for classification. They also introduce a graph regularization membership function and a computationally efficient GG recomputation algorithm.

Result: The proposed methods outperformed previous GG-based classifiers and performed equivalently to tree-based models in terms of statistical performance, as shown by experimental results using Friedman tests.

Conclusion: The refined Gabriel graph classification methods achieve smoother contours, improved computational efficiency, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art classifiers.

Abstract: While large margin classifiers are originally an outcome of an optimization framework, support vectors (SVs) can be obtained from geometric approaches. This article presents advances in the use of Gabriel graphs (GGs) in binary and multiclass classification problems. For Chipclass, a hyperparameter-less and optimization-less GG-based binary classifier, we discuss how activation functions and support edge (SE)-centered neurons affect the classification, proposing smoother functions and structural SV (SSV)-centered neurons to achieve margins with low probabilities and smoother classification contours. We extend the neural network architecture, which can be trained with backpropagation with a softmax function and a cross-entropy loss, or by solving a system of linear equations. A new subgraph-/distance-based membership function for graph regularization is also proposed, along with a new GG recomputation algorithm that is less computationally expensive than the standard approach. Experimental results with the Friedman test show that our method was better than previous GG-based classifiers and statistically equivalent to tree-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address key challenges in conditional molecular generation, such as improving chemical validity, property alignment, structural diversity, and efficient molecule sampling.

Method: The paper integrates advanced guidance methods (classifier-free, autoguidance, model guidance) into an SE(3)-equivariant flow matching framework and proposes a hybrid guidance strategy for separate and optimized guidance of molecular modalities.

Result: The proposed framework sets new state-of-the-art results in property alignment and generates molecules with high chemical validity, benchmarked on the QM9 and QMe14S datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of hybrid guidance strategies in molecular generation and evaluates the relative strengths of distinct guidance methods for wider applicability.

Abstract: Key objectives in conditional molecular generation include ensuring chemical validity, aligning generated molecules with target properties, promoting structural diversity, and enabling efficient sampling for discovery. Recent advances in computer vision introduced a range of new guidance strategies for generative models, many of which can be adapted to support these goals. In this work, we integrate state-of-the-art guidance methods -- including classifier-free guidance, autoguidance, and model guidance -- in a leading molecule generation framework built on an SE(3)-equivariant flow matching process. We propose a hybrid guidance strategy that separately guides continuous and discrete molecular modalities -- operating on velocity fields and predicted logits, respectively -- while jointly optimizing their guidance scales via Bayesian optimization. Our implementation, benchmarked on the QM9 and QMe14S datasets, achieves new state-of-the-art performance in property alignment for de novo molecular generation. The generated molecules also exhibit high structural validity. Furthermore, we systematically compare the strengths and limitations of various guidance methods, offering insights into their broader applicability.

### [418] [Learning under Distributional Drift: Reproducibility as an Intrinsic Statistical Resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13506)
*Sofiya Zaichyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'reproducibility budget' $C_T$ to measure statistical reproducibility under distributional drift, providing new bounds on generalization under such conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical statistical learning frameworks break down when the data-generating distribution changes due to external or internal factors, necessitating new methods to characterize learning under such dynamics.

Method: The authors define a new statistical quantity, $C_T$, based on the Fisher-Rao path length to measure cumulative distributional drift, and derive new generalization bounds ($ O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$), supported by minimax lower bounds.

Result: They develop a drift-feedback generalization bound, prove its minimax optimality, and establish an intrinsic 'reproducibility speed limit' for statistical learning under changing distributions.

Conclusion: The new framework provides a geometric perspective on learning under distributional drift, unifying various phenomena like exogenous drift and performative prediction through the intrinsic Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T$. 

Abstract: Statistical learning under distributional drift remains insufficiently characterized: when each observation alters the data-generating law, classical generalization bounds can collapse. We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process. The framework situates exogenous drift, adaptive data analysis, and performative prediction within a common geometric structure, with $C_T$ emerging as the intrinsic quantity measuring distributional motion across these settings.

TL;DR: EEG-DLite optimizes EEG foundation model training by distilling large datasets to remove noise and redundancy, retaining valuable data for efficient and effective model pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training EEG foundation models is resource-intensive due to large data volume and variable data quality. This work seeks to reduce computational demands and improve efficiency.

Method: EEG-DLite employs a self-supervised autoencoder to generate compact latent representations of EEG data. It filters noisy and redundant samples to create a reduced, informative dataset for training.

Result: Experiments show that training on 5% of a distilled dataset with EEG-DLite matches or outperforms performance using the full dataset across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EEG-DLite innovatively supports scalable and efficient EEG foundation modeling, simplifying pre-training processes without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large-scale EEG foundation models have shown strong generalization across a range of downstream tasks, but their training remains resource-intensive due to the volume and variable quality of EEG data. In this work, we introduce EEG-DLite, a data distillation framework that enables more efficient pre-training by selectively removing noisy and redundant samples from large EEG datasets. EEG-DLite begins by encoding EEG segments into compact latent representations using a self-supervised autoencoder, allowing sample selection to be performed efficiently and with reduced sensitivity to noise. Based on these representations, EEG-DLite filters out outliers and minimizes redundancy, resulting in a smaller yet informative subset that retains the diversity essential for effective foundation model training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training on only 5 percent of a 2,500-hour dataset curated with EEG-DLite yields performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, training on the full dataset across multiple downstream tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of pre-training data distillation in the context of EEG foundation models. EEG-DLite provides a scalable and practical path toward more effective and efficient physiological foundation modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/t170815518/EEG-DLite.

Motivation: To address LCMS's challenges of slow construction due to empirical tuning and the lack of theoretical guarantees on intolerable error probability.

Method: The proposed OptLCMS partitions the input domain and analytically assigns CMS parameters to partitions with fixed thresholds, optimizing thresholds via dynamic programming and approximate feasibility checks.

Result: OptLCMS reduces the need for empirical validation, speeds up construction, minimizes intolerable error probabilities, and achieves matching estimation accuracy compared to LCMS.

Conclusion: OptLCMS enhances LCMS by providing faster construction, theoretical guarantees, controllable error thresholds, and practical flexibility.

Abstract: Count-Min Sketch (CMS) is a memory-efficient data structure for estimating the frequency of elements in a multiset. Learned Count-Min Sketch (LCMS) enhances CMS with a machine learning model to reduce estimation error under the same memory usage, but suffers from slow construction due to empirical parameter tuning and lacks theoretical guarantees on intolerable error probability. We propose Optimized Learned Count-Min Sketch (OptLCMS), which partitions the input domain and assigns each partition to its own CMS instance, with CMS parameters analytically derived for fixed thresholds, and thresholds optimized via dynamic programming with approximate feasibility checks. This reduces the need for empirical validation, enabling faster construction while providing theoretical guarantees under these assumptions. OptLCMS also allows explicit control of the allowable error threshold, improving flexibility in practice. Experiments show that OptLCMS builds faster, achieves lower intolerable error probability, and matches the estimation accuracy of LCMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of traditional methods, which perform 1D processing of EEG signals, and the imbalance in local and global signals motivate the need for improved techniques for epilepsy prediction.

Method: The authors used Gram Matrix transformation to convert 1D EEG signals into 3D representations and introduced multi-level feature extraction incorporating coattention and inception structures to address local and global signal imbalances.

Result: Their approach, GRC-Net, achieved an accuracy of 93.66% in the challenging five-class classification task using the BONN dataset, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: Transforming EEG signals into 3D representations and using multi-granular feature extraction provides significant performance enhancements in epilepsy prediction tasks.

Abstract: Prediction of epilepsy based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a rapidly evolving field. Previous studies have traditionally applied 1D processing to the entire EEG signal. However, we have adopted the Gram Matrix method to transform the signals into a 3D representation, enabling modeling of signal relationships across dimensions while preserving the temporal dependencies of the one-dimensional signals. Additionally, we observed an imbalance between local and global signals within the EEG data. Therefore, we introduced multi-level feature extraction, utilizing coattention for capturing global signal characteristics and an inception structure for processing local signals, achieving multi-granular feature extraction. Our experiments on the BONN dataset demonstrate that for the most challenging five-class classification task, GRC-Net achieved an accuracy of 93.66%, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance prediction accuracy of computationally expensive physical models while maintaining or reducing computational costs.

Method: The study investigates embedding machine learning surrogate models into the Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter to combine both high-fidelity and low-fidelity model runs.

Result: Tests on the Lorenz-2005 and Quasi-Geostrophic models show better accuracy than purely using ML models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining ML surrogates with original physical models improves accuracy and efficiency, benefiting fields that rely on model predictions like meteorology and oceanography.

Abstract: Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in accurately forecasting long-sequence time-series data, which plays a critical role across various domains such as weather, stock prices, and power consumption.

Method: TwinFormer employs a hierarchical model comprising local and global layers leveraging top-k Sparse Attention and using GRU for patch token aggregation to enable faster forecasting with reduced computational complexity.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance across eight real-world datasets, achieving top positions in forecasting accuracy metrics (MAE and RMSE), and outperforms existing models like PatchTST, FEDformer, and Informer.

Conclusion: TwinFormer enhances forecasting precision for long-sequence time-series data, validating top-k Sparse Attention and GRU aggregation's effectiveness. It sets a new benchmark with higher efficiency and accuracy across diverse domains.

Abstract: TwinFormer is a hierarchical Transformer for long-sequence time-series forecasting. It divides the input into non-overlapping temporal patches and processes them in two stages: (1) a Local Informer with top-$k$ Sparse Attention models intra-patch dynamics, followed by mean pooling; (2) a Global Informer captures long-range inter-patch dependencies using the same top-$k$ attention. A lightweight GRU aggregates the globally contextualized patch tokens for direct multi-horizon prediction. The resulting architecture achieves linear $O(kLd)$ time and memory complexity. On eight real-world benchmarking datasets from six different domains, including weather, stock price, temperature, power consumption, electricity, and disease, and forecasting horizons $96-720$, TwinFormer secures $27$ positions in the top two out of $34$. Out of the $27$, it achieves the best performance on MAE and RMSE at $17$ places and $10$ at the second-best place on MAE and RMSE. This consistently outperforms PatchTST, iTransformer, FEDformer, Informer, and vanilla Transformers.

Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases pose a serious global health threat, causing over 700,000 deaths annually. This work introduces a proof-of-concept Synthetic Swarm Mosquito Dataset for Acoustic Classification, created to simulate realistic multi-species and noisy swarm conditions. Unlike conventional datasets that require labor-intensive recording of individual mosquitoes, the synthetic approach enables scalable data generation while reducing human resource demands. Using log-mel spectrograms, we evaluated lightweight deep learning architectures for the classification of mosquito species. Experiments show that these models can effectively identify six major mosquito vectors and are suitable for deployment on embedded low-power devices. The study demonstrates the potential of synthetic swarm audio datasets to accelerate acoustic mosquito research and enable scalable real-time surveillance solutions.

### [426] [The Data Efficiency Frontier of Financial Foundation Models: Scaling Laws from Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12384)
*Jesse Ponnock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study analyzes the effects of domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) on financial language models, showing that specialization can be achieved efficiently with modest data and models while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how domain-adaptive pretraining can specialize language models for specific domains (like finance) without retraining, making it a practical and efficient method.

Method: Conducted a scaling-law analysis with continued domain pretraining on U.S. SEC filings, using 1B and 3B-parameter models, and evaluated performance across multiple data scales to study efficiency and improvements.

Result: The models showed consistent gains in domain-specific performance with diminishing returns after 200M tokens, no general domain degradation, and demonstrated efficient learnability of financial language.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation via modest token budgets is effective, and scaling to larger models (7B-70B parameters) for financial tasks is feasible without catastrophic forgetting or performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) offers a practical path to specializing large language models for high-value domains without full retraining. We conduct an early-stage scaling-law analysis of continued pretraining on U.S. SEC filings, training 1B and 3B-parameter Llama-3.2 models on a 400M-token financial corpus with validation checkpoints at 50M, 100M, 200M, and 400M tokens. Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements.

### [427] [Anchoring Values in Temporal and Group Dimensions for Flow Matching Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12387)
*Yawen Shao,Jie Xiao,Kai Zhu,Yu Liu,Wei Zhai,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGPO, an improvement over GRPO, for flow matching-based image generation, addressing issues in sparse reward assignments and optimization fading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GRPO encounters limitations with flow matching-based image generation due to sparse terminal rewards and optimization stagnation from decreased reward diversity.

Method: VGPO introduces process-aware value estimates for dense, generative stage-specific credit assignment and replaces group normalization with a stability-enhancing absolute value process.

Result: VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality, better task-specific accuracy, and mitigates reward hacking across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed VGPO framework effectively resolves the identified limitations of GRPO, enhancing image generation in terms of quality, accuracy, and robustness.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven highly effective in enhancing the alignment capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepVekua integrates geometric deep learning with spectral analysis to efficiently solve PDEs, especially in sparse data settings, significantly outperforming alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address spectral bias and challenges in solving PDEs in complex geometries with sparse data.

Method: DeepVekua employs a hybrid architecture, mapping geometries to a latent harmonic space using diffeomorphic transformations and separating geometry and physics learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 100x improvement over spectral baselines on advection-diffusion systems.

Conclusion: DeepVekua is a promising technique for addressing PDEs in sparse data regimes, effectively solving spectral biases and optimizing representation.

Abstract: We present DeepVekua, a hybrid architecture that unifies geometric deep learning with spectral analysis to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in sparse data regimes. By learning a diffeomorphic coordinate transformation that maps complex geometries to a latent harmonic space, our method outperforms state-of-the-art implicit representations on advection-diffusion systems. Unlike standard coordinate-based networks which struggle with spectral bias, DeepVekua separates the learning of geometry from the learning of physics, solving for optimal spectral weights in closed form. We demonstrate a 100x improvement over spectral baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/VladimerKhasia/vekuanet.

*Franck Le,Keith Grueneberg,Erich Nahum,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BOLERO, a method using lightweight graph priors to enhance pre-trained tabular transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and regression benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of explicit mechanisms to model relationships among instances in existing tabular data methods, aiming to leverage inter-row reasoning for improved outcomes.

Method: BOLERO employs a lightweight static bipartite graph head on RoBERTa-Tab to connect instances to feature/value anchors using a GNN for refinement while keeping the backbone frozen.

Result: BOLERO outperforms strong baselines like XGBoost, CatBoost, TP-BERTa, and TabPFN-v2 on classification and regression tasks as per robust statistical evaluation.

Conclusion: Lightweight graph priors significantly enhance the performance of pretrained tabular transformers, validating the proposed method.

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many real-world systems. While recent tabular transformers and in-context learners such as SAINT, TP-BERTa, TabPFN, TabICL, and MITRA incorporate limited inter-row reasoning, most approaches still lack an explicit mechanism to model relationships among instances, even though similar samples often share related outcomes. We investigate whether introducing \emph{simple graph priors} can enhance \emph{pretrained tabular transformers}. Concretely, we introduce {BOLERO}, a lightweight, static bipartite graph head that augments {RoBERTa-Tab} (a RoBERTa-style tabular backbone pretrained with masked-token prediction.) Each instance connects to feature/value anchors; a small GNN refines row representations, while the backbone remains frozen. We evaluate on 80 classification and 64 regression datasets from the TP-BERTa benchmark suites, comparing against strong baselines including XGBoost, CatBoost, TabPFN-v2, MITRA, TabICL, TP-BERTa, and RoBERTa-Tab. To ensure statistically sound conclusions, we follow best practices for multi-dataset evaluation: pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on per-dataset score differences and effect sizes (median improvement with confidence intervals), rather than mean-rank post-hoc tests that depend on the competitor pool. BOLERO achieves the highest number of statistically significant wins across both classification and regression, demonstrating that lightweight graph priors meaningfully improve pretrained tabular transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the explainability of Graph Spectral Clustering results, especially for text documents, by utilizing rough set theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Spectral Clustering methods struggle with explainability due to spectral embedding and unclear document content meanings.

Method: This paper enhances explanation methodology using concepts from rough set theory.

Result: Enhanced explainability of Graph Spectral Clustering results, addressing issues with unclear document meaning and stochastic nature.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology improves interpretability of clustering outputs, aiding in better understanding and application in text analysis.

Abstract: Graph Spectral Clustering methods (GSC) allow representing clusters of diverse shapes, densities, etc. However, the results of such algorithms, when applied e.g. to text documents, are hard to explain to the user, especially due to embedding in the spectral space which has no obvious relation to document contents. Furthermore, the presence of documents without clear content meaning and the stochastic nature of the clustering algorithms deteriorate explainability. This paper proposes an enhancement to the explanation methodology, proposed in an earlier research of our team. It allows us to overcome the latter problems by taking inspiration from rough set theory.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ViT-based Masked Autoencoder leveraging domain knowledge for improved reconstruction quality and performance in self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability, generalization, and data efficiency in deep learning by integrating scientific domain knowledge.

Method: Incorporates Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) as constraints within a self-supervised ViT-based Masked Autoencoder.

Result: The approach achieves better reconstruction fidelity, stabilizes training, and improves downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Embedding physics-informed biases within transformer-based self-supervised models shows promise in improving model performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Integrating domain knowledge into deep learning has emerged as a promising direction for improving model interpretability, generalization, and data efficiency. In this work, we present a novel knowledge-guided ViT-based Masked Autoencoder that embeds scientific domain knowledge within the self-supervised reconstruction process. Instead of relying solely on data-driven optimization, our proposed approach incorporates the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) as a physical constraint and physically-based Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), ensuring that learned representations adhere to known structural relationships between observed signals and their latent components. The framework jointly optimizes LSMM and SAM loss with a conventional Huber loss objective, promoting both numerical accuracy and geometric consistency in the feature space. This knowledge-guided design enhances reconstruction fidelity, stabilizes training under limited supervision, and yields interpretable latent representations grounded in physical principles. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model substantially enhances reconstruction quality and improves downstream task performance, highlighting the promise of embedding physics-informed inductive biases within transformer-based self-supervised learning.

### [432] [Exploring the Design Space of Transition Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12465)
*Uriel Singer,Yaron Lipman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Transition Matching (TM), a new generative modeling paradigm, focusing on the design and functioning of its internal 'head' module, backed with comprehensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated to improve the expressiveness and efficiency of generative modeling paradigms by advancing Transition Matching (TM), which can surpass diffusion and flow models by employing an internal generative model.

Method: The paper uses systematic experimentation involving 56 large-scale generative models and ablation studies analyzing how different head module architectures and sampling strategies affect training, efficiency, and generation quality.

Result: The study finds that TM with an MLP head combined with specific time weighting and high-frequency sampling outperforms baselines in quality and efficiency. Transformer heads with sequence scaling excel in image aesthetics but lag in overall ranking.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the design and sampling strategies that optimize TM frameworks for quality and efficiency, while pointing out directions where further improvements are unlikely.

Abstract: Transition Matching (TM) is an emerging paradigm for generative modeling that generalizes diffusion and flow-matching models as well as continuous-state autoregressive models. TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller "head" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics. Lastly, we believe the experiments presented highlight the design aspects that are likely to provide most quality and efficiency gains, while at the same time indicate what design choices are not likely to provide further gains.

### [433] [Sparse Concept Anchoring for Interpretable and Controllable Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12469)
*Sandy Fraser,Patryk Wielopolski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Concept Anchoring is a method to bias a model’s latent space for specific concepts with minimal supervision, enabling interpretable and steerable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of interpretability and steerability in learned representations of machine learning models, particularly the difficulty of targeting specific concepts in latent space with minimal labeled data.

Method: The proposed method biases latent space using activation normalization, separation regularizers, and anchor/subspace regularizers by utilizing labeled examples for less than 0.1% of data to anchor specific concepts in predefined directions or subspaces.

Result: Experiments show the method selectively attenuates targeted concepts with minimal effect on other features, and can completely remove concepts with low reconstruction error, approaching theoretical limits.

Conclusion: Sparse Concept Anchoring provides a practical solution for creating interpretable and controllable behavioral adjustments in latent representations, facilitating both reversible and permanent interventions.

Abstract: We introduce Sparse Concept Anchoring, a method that biases latent space to position a targeted subset of concepts while allowing others to self-organize, using only minimal supervision (labels for <0.1% of examples per anchored concept). Training combines activation normalization, a separation regularizer, and anchor or subspace regularizers that attract rare labeled examples to predefined directions or axis-aligned subspaces. The anchored geometry enables two practical interventions: reversible behavioral steering that projects out a concept's latent component at inference, and permanent removal via targeted weight ablation of anchored dimensions. Experiments on structured autoencoders show selective attenuation of targeted concepts with negligible impact on orthogonal features, and complete elimination with reconstruction error approaching theoretical bounds. Sparse Concept Anchoring therefore provides a practical pathway to interpretable, steerable behavior in learned representations.

### [434] [GoMS: Graph of Molecule Substructure Network for Molecule Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12489)
*Shuhui Qu,Cheolwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents GoMS, a novel graph-based architecture for molecular property prediction, which outperforms existing methods like ESAN by explicitly modeling relationships between molecular substructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like ESAN fail to consider relationships between molecular substructures, which are critical for accurately predicting molecular properties.

Method: The GoMS framework models molecules as graphs of substructures where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their spatial relationships, preserving topological and connectivity information.

Result: GoMS delivers superior performance compared to ESAN and other baselines, particularly excelling with large molecules (100+ atoms) in both accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: GoMS effectively captures substructure relationships often lost in previous methods, advancing scalable molecular property prediction with potential applications in complex, real-world scenarios like materials science.

Abstract: While graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in molecular property prediction, current approaches like the Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) treat molecules as bags of independent substructures, overlooking crucial relationships between these components. We present Graph of Molecule Substructures (GoMS), a novel architecture that explicitly models the interactions and spatial arrangements between molecular substructures. Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements. Our approach shows particular promise for materials science applications involving complex molecules where properties emerge from the interplay between multiple functional units. By capturing substructure relationships that are lost in bag-based approaches, GoMS represents a significant advance toward scalable and interpretable molecular property prediction for real-world applications.

*Vaarunay Kaushal,Rajib Mall*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on early identification of at-risk students, comparing Decision Tree and LSTM models over time, indicating varying importance of performance metrics for different intervention stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance early detection of at-risk students in online learning environments for effective intervention.

Method: The study employs Decision Tree and LSTM models to analyze prediction accuracy over six temporal stages up to Week 20, emphasizing different performance metrics during various stages of intervention.

Result: LSTM excels in early predictions (97% recall at Week 2), while Decision Tree performs consistently across mid-course (78% accuracy). By Week 20, both converge in recall (68%), but LSTM achieves higher precision (90% vs 86%). Demographic features dominate prediction at 68% importance.

Conclusion: Different metrics are critical in different stages: high recall initially, balanced precision-recall mid-course, and high precision later. Model choice should align with the timing of intervention, and demographic features enable reliable early predictions without assessment data.

Abstract: Early identification of at-risk students is critical for effective intervention in online learning environments. This study extends temporal prediction analysis to Week 20 (50% of course duration), comparing Decision Tree and Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) models across six temporal snapshots. Our analysis reveals that different performance metrics matter at different intervention stages: high recall is critical for early intervention (Weeks 2-4), while balanced precision-recall is important for mid-course resource allocation (Weeks 8-16), and high precision becomes paramount in later stages (Week 20). We demonstrate that static demographic features dominate predictions (68% importance), enabling assessment-free early prediction. The LSTM model achieves 97% recall at Week 2, making it ideal for early intervention, while Decision Tree provides stable balanced performance (78% accuracy) during mid-course. By Week 20, both models converge to similar recall (68%), but LSTM achieves higher precision (90% vs 86%). Our findings also suggest that model selection should depend on intervention timing, and that early signals (Weeks 2-4) are sufficient for reliable initial prediction using primarily demographic and pre-enrollment information.

*Ioannis Anagnostides,Zachary W. Sollie,Arman Kilic,Tuomas Sandholm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in heart transplant allocation policy by proposing new methods and using a novel simulator to evaluate policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart transplantation is constrained by donor shortages, and current allocation policies inadequately consider pre- and post-transplant mortality, necessitating improved approaches.

Method: The authors develop a new simulator using UNOS historical data, evaluate the current policy, propose a myopic policy, introduce a dynamic approach with 'potentials,' and assess batching donors.

Result: They demonstrate that the myopic policy and policies with potentials perform better than the status quo. Batching donors also improves outcomes, and the simulator explores factors like geographic proximity and rejection tendencies.

Conclusion: The study provides tools and methodologies that could lead to more effective heart transplant allocation policies, potentially saving more lives.

Abstract: Heart transplantation is a viable path for patients suffering from advanced heart failure, but this lifesaving option is severely limited due to donor shortage. Although the current allocation policy was recently revised in 2018, a major concern is that it does not adequately take into account pretransplant and post-transplant mortality. In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.
  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neural network architecture using singular value decomposition and semi-orthogonality constraints to improve contrastive learning for detecting critical transitions in noisy time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting critical transitions in noisy time-series data is challenging due to the masking effect of stochastic variability and the limitations of standard contrastive learning approaches.

Method: The paper proposes a neural network architecture based on singular value decomposition, combined with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, for improved performance in contrastive learning.

Result: The proposed method matches traditional contrastive learning in detecting critical transitions, while being more lightweight and resistant to noise.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising, efficient, and noise-resilient alternative to traditional contrastive learning for identifying critical transitions in time-series data.

Abstract: Detecting critical transitions in complex, noisy time-series data is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) on financial time series (MSCI World index) to create graph representations and analyzes their structure using graph neural networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how graph representations of decomposed financial time series can aid predictive modeling, especially by leveraging scale-dependent structures.

Method: The study employs CEEMDAN for decomposing the MSCI World index into nine intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These IMFs are transformed into graphs via natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graph methods.

Result: The transformed graphs reveal that high-frequency IMFs result in dense small-world graphs, while low-frequency IMFs create sparser networks. Visibility-based graphs are sensitive to amplitude and clustering, whereas recurrence graphs maintain temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: Using graph-based representations calibrated to the intrinsic structures of financial data components can enhance graph neural network (GNN) performance for modeling financial time series.

Abstract: This study applies Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to the MSCI World index and converts the resulting intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) into graph representations to enable modeling with graph neural networks (GNNs). Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a pruning method for neural networks, focusing on the most important neurons using graph theory-based eigenvector centrality for improved fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of adapting pre-trained neural networks more effectively during fine-tuning by leveraging insights from social network dynamics.

Method: The proposed method represents neurons as nodes in a graph, computes importance scores using eigenvector centrality, prunes less important neurons, and then fine-tunes the resulting pruned network.

Result: Experiments on various models and datasets show higher classification accuracy and reduced model complexity, e.g., achieving 48% accuracy on Oxford Flowers 102 versus 30% from baseline VGGNet.

Conclusion: Graph theory-based pruning enhances neural network fine-tuning, delivering improved accuracy and efficiency through adaptive focus on influential neurons.

Abstract: In social media networks a small number of highly influential users can drive large scale changes in discourse across multiple communities. Small shifts in the behavior of these users are often sufficient to propagate widely throughout the network. A similar phenomenon occurs during neural network fine tuning. Conventional fine tuning of convolutional neural networks typically adds a new linear classification layer on top of a large pre trained model. Instead we argue that improved adaptation can be achieved by first pruning the network to retain only the most important neurons and then performing fine tuning.
  We propose a graph theory based method for pruning neural networks that is designed to improve fine tuning performance. In this method each neuron is represented as a node and edges encode similarity between neurons. Neurons are pruned based on importance scores computed using eigenvector centrality. The resulting pruned network is then fine tuned using only the most central neurons. We evaluate the proposed method on VGGNet EfficientNet and ResNet models using the TF Flowers Caltech one zero one and Oxford Flowers one zero two datasets. The proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy while significantly reducing model complexity. On the Oxford Flowers one zero two dataset the method achieves forty eight percent classification accuracy compared to thirty percent accuracy obtained by the baseline VGGNet model.

TL;DR: TianXing-S2S is a probabilistic model for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts that uses advanced techniques to predict extreme weather events due to climate change with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurate S2S predictions of extreme events, crucial for resource planning and disaster mitigation, amidst the uncertainties of a changing climate and complex multi-sphere interactions.

Method: The model encodes multi-sphere predictors into a latent space and uses a diffusion model for ensemble forecasts. An optimal transport (OT)-based coupling module is incorporated to enhance interactions between atmospheric and boundary conditions.

Result: TianXing-S2S outperforms ECMWF S2S and FuXi-S2S in 45-day daily-mean ensemble forecasts and predicts extreme weather conditions such as heatwaves and anomalous precipitation accurately, by identifying soil moisture as a key indicator.

Conclusion: TianXing-S2S provides a stable, extended forecast framework up to 180 days and demonstrates its potential as a robust tool for S2S predictions in a warming climate.

Abstract: Accurate subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction of extreme events is critical for resource planning and disaster mitigation under accelerating climate change. However, such predictions remain challenging due to complex multi-sphere interactions and intrinsic atmospheric uncertainty. Here we present TianXing-S2S, a multi-sphere coupled probabilistic model for global S2S daily ensemble forecast. TianXing-S2S first encodes diverse multi-sphere predictors into a compact latent space, then employs a diffusion model to generate daily ensemble forecasts. A novel coupling module based on optimal transport (OT) is incorporated in the denoiser to optimize the interactions between atmospheric and multi-sphere boundary conditions. Across key atmospheric variables, TianXing-S2S outperforms both the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S system and FuXi-S2S in 45-day daily-mean ensemble forecasts at 1.5 resolution. Our model achieves skillful subseasonal prediction of extreme events including heat waves and anomalous precipitation, identifying soil moisture as a critical precursor signal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TianXing-S2S can generate stable rollout forecasts up to 180 days, establishing a robust framework for S2S research in a warming world.

*David Strnadel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using quantum circuit-based energy terms as auxiliary signals in GAN training. Experiments on a simulator show improvements in classification but highlight limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether energy terms derived from quantum circuits can enhance GANs by serving as auxiliary regularizers, potentially influencing model properties.

Method: Augment ACGAN's generator objective with a VQE-inspired energy term calculated from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's tools and TorchConnector.

Result: On MNIST, the energy-regularized QACGAN achieved fast high classification accuracy but showed variance in sample quality metrics. Computational performance was 200x slower due to simulated artifacts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility of integrating VQE-style computations into GAN training but avoids claims of quantum advantage or scalability and leaves open the efficacy compared to classical methods.

Abstract: This paper presents an exploratory, simulator-based proof of concept investigating whether differentiable energy terms derived from parameterized quantum circuits can serve as auxiliary regularization signals in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We augment the Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) generator objective with a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)-inspired energy term computed from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's EstimatorQNN and TorchConnector.
  Important limitations: All experiments run on a noiseless statevector simulator with only 4 qubits, use a deliberately simple Hamiltonian parameterization, and lack ablation studies comparing against equivalent classical biases. The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.
  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.
  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting. The contribution is methodological: demonstrating that VQE-style energy computations can be integrated into GAN training loops via differentiable pathways. Whether such auxiliary signals provide benefits beyond equivalent classical regularizers remains an open question requiring systematic ablation studies, which we leave for future work.

*Jingdi Lei,Di Zhang,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), an advancement in linear-time attention models that eliminates error accumulation and achieves robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic time bottleneck in softmax attention models and improve stability and scalability in long-context language models.

Method: EFLA uses a novel continuous-time dynamical system formulation of the delta rule, leveraging a rank-1 dynamics matrix to compute an exact closed-form solution in linear time.

Result: EFLA achieves robust performance in noisy setups, reduces language modeling perplexity, excels in benchmarks compared to DeltaNet, without adding extra parameters.

Conclusion: EFLA offers a stable and scalable framework for linear-time attention models, laying a theoretical foundation for further advancements.

Abstract: Linear-time attention and State Space Models (SSMs) promise to solve the quadratic cost bottleneck in long-context language models employing softmax attention. We introduce Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), a numerically stable, fully parallelism and generalized formulation of the delta rule. Specifically, we formulate the online learning update as a continuous-time dynamical system and prove that its exact solution is not only attainable but also computable in linear time with full parallelism. By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order Runge-Kutta method. This attention mechanism is theoretically free from error accumulation, perfectly capturing the continuous dynamics while preserving the linear-time complexity. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that EFLA enables robust performance in noisy environments, achieving lower language modeling perplexity and superior downstream benchmark performance than DeltaNet without introducing additional parameters. Our work provides a new theoretical foundation for building high-fidelity, scalable linear-time attention models.

*Pranav Gupta,Nithin Surendran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in model interpretability and causal inference within retail sales analytics, proposing methods to enhance explainability and validate causal effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retailers face difficulty interpreting machine learning models used for analyzing and predicting sales due to their lack of transparency and inability to confirm causal relationships.

Method: The authors review existing literature and implement causal inference techniques and model interpretability using a real-world dataset, showing the benefits of explainable models and double machine learning.

Result: The study reveals that models with lower variance in SHAP values are inherently explainable, and addressing confounders with double machine learning yields accurate causal effect directions.

Conclusion: Integrating causal inference and interpretability techniques can enhance understanding and decision-making in retail sales analytics, providing clearer causal and predictive insights.

Abstract: Most major retailers today have multiple divisions focused on various aspects, such as marketing, supply chain, online customer experience, store customer experience, employee productivity, and vendor fulfillment. They also regularly collect data corresponding to all these aspects as dashboards and weekly/monthly/quarterly reports. Although several machine learning and statistical techniques have been in place to analyze and predict key metrics, such models typically lack interpretability. Moreover, such techniques also do not allow the validation or discovery of causal links. In this paper, we aim to provide a recipe for applying model interpretability and causal inference for deriving sales insights. In this paper, we review the existing literature on causal inference and interpretability in the context of problems in e-commerce and retail, and apply them to a real-world dataset. We find that an inherently explainable model has a lower variance of SHAP values, and show that including multiple confounders through a double machine learning approach allows us to get the correct sign of causal effect.

Result: The benchmark highlights tgp's broad functionality, showing that different pooling operators excel depending on datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: tgp facilitates fast prototyping and research in GNNs by providing a comprehensive tool for exploring and implementing hierarchical pooling methods.

Abstract: We introduce Torch Geometric Pool (tgp), a library for hierarchical pooling in Graph Neural Networks. Built upon Pytorch Geometric, Torch Geometric Pool (tgp) provides a wide variety of pooling operators, unified under a consistent API and a modular design. The library emphasizes usability and extensibility, and includes features like precomputed pooling, which significantly accelerate training for a class of operators. In this paper, we present tgp's structure and present an extensive benchmark. The latter showcases the library's features and systematically compares the performance of the implemented graph-pooling methods in different downstream tasks. The results, showing that the choice of the optimal pooling operator depends on tasks and data at hand, support the need for a library that enables fast prototyping.

*Gelesh G Omathil,Sreeja CS*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses 'PerNodeDrop,' a regularization method that injects sample-specific perturbations to neural networks, aimed at reducing overfitting while retaining beneficial representational capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses overfitting in neural networks due to neuron co-adaptation, which captures both beneficial and spurious patterns that harm generalization on unseen data.

Method: Introduces 'PerNodeDrop,' a regularizer that applies sample-specific, per-node perturbations during training instead of batch-level or layer-wide disruptions, allowing for input-specific regularization.

Result: Empirical tests across vision, text, and audio benchmarks show that PerNodeDrop improves generalization and reliability on unseen data, outperforming standard noise-based regularizers.

Conclusion: PerNodeDrop effectively balances the reduction of harmful co-adaptation and the preservation of useful interactions, narrowing the performance gap between training and validation and enhancing reliability on new data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks possess strong representational capacity yet remain vulnerable to overfitting, primarily because neurons tend to co-adapt in ways that, while capturing complex and fine-grained feature interactions, also reinforce spurious and non-generalizable patterns that inflate training performance but reduce reliability on unseen data. Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.
  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.
  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions. Empirical evaluations on vision, text, and audio benchmarks indicate improved generalization relative to the standard noise-based regularizer.

*Jiawei Shen,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Guoqing Ma,Yidan Liang,Jingjiang Liu,Hao Chen,Shimin Di*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynaGen, a unified approach for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR), addressing both interpolation and extrapolation challenges with improved performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TKGR methods struggle with limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation, hindering effective reasoning across timelines.

Method: DynaGen employs a dynamic entity-centric subgraph construction and dual-branch GNN encoder for interpolation, while leveraging a conditional diffusion process for enhanced extrapolation.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with DynaGen improving the MRR score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation on average.

Conclusion: DynaGen effectively addresses major TKGR challenges by integrating advanced methods for improved contextual modeling and cognitive generalization, outperforming existing approaches in both tasks.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) aims to complete missing factual elements along the timeline. Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation.

*Maria Khilchuk,Vladimir Latypov,Pavel Kleshchev,Alexander Hvatov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces surrogate models to simplify and accelerate generative modeling with Diffusion and Schrödinger Bridge methods, proposing SINDy-FM and DSBM-NeuralODE algorithms to improve efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models, such as Diffusion and Schrödinger Bridge, suffer from high computational costs and inefficient training methods.

Method: The authors proposed two key surrogate models: SINDy-FM uses sparse regression to identify simpler symbolic differential equations, while DSBM-NeuralODE reformulates Schrödinger Bridge for efficient continuous-time parameterization.

Result: Experimental results on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation show competitive performance with improved efficiency and significant reductions in parameter complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed surrogate models enable faster and more interpretable generative modeling, demonstrating potential for practical deployment with reduced computational resource demands.

Abstract: Diffusion and Schrödinger Bridge models have established state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling but are often hampered by significant computational costs and complex training procedures. While continuous-time bridges promise faster sampling, overparameterized neural networks describe their optimal dynamics, and the underlying stochastic differential equations can be difficult to integrate efficiently. This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics. We propose two specific algorithms: SINDy Flow Matching (SINDy-FM), which leverages sparse regression to identify interpretable, symbolic differential equations from data, and a Neural-ODE reformulation of the Schrödinger Bridge (DSBM-NeuralODE) for flexible continuous-time parameterization. Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability. The symbolic SINDy-FM models, in particular, reduce parameter counts by several orders of magnitude and enable near-instantaneous inference, paving the way for a new class of tractable and high-performing bridge models for practical deployment.

*Dongseok Kim,Hyoungsun Choi,Mohamed Jismy Aashik Rasool,Gisung Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how fixed Transformer models can exhibit varied behaviors solely through different prompts, treating prompts like external programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to develop a theoretical understanding behind how prompts influence fixed Transformer models, moving away from empirical heuristics.

Method: A simplified Transformer is constructed to treat prompts as externally injected programs, breaking down its mechanism into attention routing, arithmetic by FFN, and multi-step computation through stacking.

Result: The study proves that a fixed Transformer backbone can approximate diverse behaviors using only prompt variations, establishing theoretical insights.

Conclusion: The framework provides foundations for understanding trade-offs and limitations of prompt-driven behaviors in Transformers, expanding theoretical knowledge beyond practical use cases.

Abstract: Prompts can switch a model's behavior even when the weights are fixed, yet this phenomenon is rarely treated as a clean theoretical object rather than a heuristic. We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study revisits the recent preference of reinforcement learning (RL) over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in vision-language models (VLMs) reasoning, highlighting that SFT is more effective in many scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate the assumption that reinforcement learning outperforms supervised fine-tuning in enhancing vision-language model reasoning abilities.

Method: A systematic and controlled comparison between SFT and RL was conducted using identical datasets, with analysis on the effects of model capacity, data scale, and distribution.

Result: SFT is found to be effective for weaker models, more data efficient, and better in cross-modal generalization compared to RL. It also uncovers issues in RL where rewards do not correlate with reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The study challenges the dominant RL-centric narrative, emphasizing the complementary role of SFT and RL for a balanced model training approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) reasoning have been largely attributed to the rise of reinforcement Learning (RL), which has shifted the community's focus away from the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing "RL over SFT" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Bayesian framework is introduced for efficiently handling exploration in scenarios where tasks involve partial context and complex latent dependencies, excelling over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of contextual multi-task bandit problems requires a method that accounts for partial context, latent reward dependencies, and inherent uncertainties to improve learning efficiency.

Method: The proposed approach integrates observations from all tasks into a particle-based log-density Gaussian process, enabling joint modeling across tasks without assumptions on latent variables.

Result: Empirically, the method demonstrated superior performance over traditional hierarchical bandits, especially in cases with complex or misspecified latent context.

Conclusion: This framework effectively balances structural and user-specific uncertainties, offering a robust solution for learning in multi-task and multi-context settings.

Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian framework for efficient exploration in contextual multi-task multi-armed bandit settings, where the context is only observed partially and dependencies between reward distributions are induced by latent context variables. In order to exploit these structural dependencies, our approach integrates observations across all tasks and learns a global joint distribution, while still allowing personalised inference for new tasks. In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines such as hierarchical model bandits, especially in settings with model misspecification or complex latent heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved approach, MT-PINN, for ensuring zero terminal inventory in optimal trade execution using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address shortcomings in Vanilla PINNs, where they often fail to enforce strong terminal constraints and produce unstable controls in trade execution models.

Method: The proposed MT-PINN integrates a rollout-based trajectory loss and enforces zero terminal inventory through a backpropagation-through-time terminal penalty, stabilized using a lambda-curriculum.

Result: MT-PINN aligns closely with analytical solutions in the Gatheral-Schied model, concentrates terminal inventory effectively around zero, and performs competitively on SPY intraday data under various risk-aversion settings.

Conclusion: MT-PINN successfully overcomes weaknesses of Vanilla PINNs, providing accurate and stable optimal trade execution models, especially for risk-averse scenarios.

Abstract: We study optimal trade execution with a hard-zero terminal inventory constraint, modeled via Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Vanilla PINNs often under-enforce this constraint and produce unstable controls. We propose a Multi-Trajectory PINN (MT-PINN) that adds a rollout-based trajectory loss and propagates a terminal penalty on terminal inventory via backpropagation-through-time, directly enforcing zero terminal inventory. A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical foundation for a regression method derived from principles of indifference, leading to optimal kernel-based models without requiring empirical selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to derive a regression method analytically, investigating its fundamental optimality properties by leveraging symmetry and indifference principles.

Method: The derivation uses the theory of random functions and assumes symmetry properties like translation and scaling invariance to analytically determine the kernel form and regularization.

Result: The kernel solution is defined as a generalized polyharmonic spline arising naturally from analytical postulates. It is theoretically optimal in scenarios lacking prior information.

Conclusion: This work provides a principled basis for smoothing and interpolation methods, ensuring their methodological soundness based on symmetry and indifference principles.

Abstract: This paper studies a machine learning regression problem as a multivariate approximation problem using the framework of the theory of random functions. An ab initio derivation of a regression method is proposed, starting from postulates of indifference. It is shown that if a probability measure on an infinite-dimensional function space possesses natural symmetries (invariance under translation, rotation, scaling, and Gaussianity), then the entire solution scheme, including the kernel form, the type of regularization, and the noise parameterization, follows analytically from these postulates. The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle. This result provides a theoretical foundation for a broad class of smoothing and interpolation methods, demonstrating their optimality in the absence of a priori information.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiency through input sparsification and introduces trainable spontaneous neurons to enhance performance. Results show this approach minimizes efficiency-induced performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face issues in efficiency and interpretability due to their massive scale. Structural pruning addresses these issues, but sparsification approaches often neglect the impact on model representation, leading to performance gaps.

Method: The study reinterprets input sparsification as dynamic structural pruning and introduces trainable spontaneous neurons to stabilize activations and compensate for sparsification effects.

Result: Experiments show that the inclusion of spontaneous neurons significantly reduces performance gaps caused by sparsification while maintaining generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of introducing spontaneous neurons improves the efficiency and performance of sparsified LLMs, providing a balanced solution for computational savings and model stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of applications, but their massive scale poses significant challenges for both efficiency and interpretability. Structural pruning, which reduces model size by removing redundant computational units such as neurons, has been widely explored as a solution, and this study devotes to input sparsification, an increasingly popular technique that improves efficiency by selectively activating only a subset of entry values for each input. However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning. Motivated by the spontaneous baseline firing rates observed in biological neurons, we introduce a small set of trainable spontaneous neurons that act as compensatory units to stabilize activations in sparsified LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that these auxiliary neurons substantially reduce the sparsification-induced performance gap while generalizing effectively across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of data heterogeneity and local drift in Federated Learning, which hinders efficient global model convergence.

Method: FLFA integrates feedback alignment into FL by utilizing the global model's weights as a shared matrix during the backward pass of local training, reducing local drift without additional computation or communication costs.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations show that FLFA alleviates local drift, achieves robust convergence for models, and enhances existing FL methods.

Conclusion: FLFA presents a novel approach to improve Federated Learning by addressing local drift and data heterogeneity, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness in empirical and theoretical evaluations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy, yet it struggles with data heterogeneity, where clients' data are not distributed independently and identically (non-IID). This causes local drift, hindering global model convergence. To address this, we introduce Federated Learning with Feedback Alignment (FLFA), a novel framework that integrates feedback alignment into FL. FLFA uses the global model's weights as a shared feedback matrix during local training's backward pass, aligning local updates with the global model efficiently. This approach mitigates local drift with minimal additional computational cost and no extra communication overhead.
  Our theoretical analysis supports FLFA's design by showing how it alleviates local drift and demonstrates robust convergence for both local and global models. Empirical evaluations, including accuracy comparisons and measurements of local drift, further illustrate that FLFA can enhance other FL methods demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Mohammad Abu-Shaira,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OLR-WAA, a hyperparameter-free online regression model designed for non-stationary data streams, addressing concept drift effectively with adaptive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data distributions in real-world scenarios change over time, leading to concept drift that reduces model effectiveness. Fixed hyperparameters in online models further limit adaptability.

Method: OLR-WAA uses an exponentially weighted moving average and a custom optimization strategy to dynamically detect and handle concept drift, ensuring stable and adaptive updates based on real-time data.

Result: Evaluations show the model consistently outperforms online models and matches static batch regression performance. It rapidly converges and achieves superior R2 values while bridging gaps in performance caused by concept drift.

Conclusion: OLR-WAA offers a robust solution for dealing with non-stationary data, balancing stability and adaptability, and effectively addressing challenges posed by concept drift.

Abstract: Real-world datasets frequently exhibit evolving data distributions, reflecting temporal variations and underlying shifts. Overlooking this phenomenon, known as concept drift, can substantially degrade the predictive performance of the model. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue, as these parameters are typically fixed and lack the flexibility to dynamically adjust to evolving data. This paper introduces "OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability. OLR-WAA incrementally updates its base model by integrating incoming data streams, utilizing an exponentially weighted moving average. It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness. Concept drift datasets reveal a performance gap that OLR-WAA effectively bridges, setting it apart from other online models. In addition, the model effectively handles confidence-based scenarios through a conservative update strategy that prioritizes stable, high-confidence data points. Notably, OLR-WAA converges rapidly, consistently yielding higher R2 values compared to other online models.

Motivation: To address the geometric inefficiency of the canonical $O(N^2)$ Transformer model, which affects its training process.

Method: Developing a gradient-based optimization framework using asymmetric projection to decompose backward gradients into parallel spans and orthogonal violations while preserving the canonical Transformer forward-pass structure.

Result: Experiments on WikiText-2 showed a $0.56\%$ reduction in validation loss, proving the method's viability.

Conclusion: Selective gradient scaling based on this framework enhances Transformer training, with promising implications for larger datasets and deeper trainings.

Abstract: The canonical $O(N^2)$ Transformer remains the empirical performance frontier in sequence modeling, and its training can be further optimized by addressing geometric inefficiency. We propose an optimization framework that leverages an asymmetric projection to decompose the backward-pass gradients into parallel spans and orthogonal violations, while keeping the canonical forward-pass $QKV$ structure intact. Through consistent experimental validation across various decomposition and projection setups, we provide strong theoretical evidence: the standard attention gradient is suboptimal. We demonstrated that selectively scaling these components, focusing primarily on $0^{th}$ order bidirectional parallel spans, yields the most effective learning signal. On the limited WikiText-2 dataset, and using a crude configuration, this method achieved a $0.56\%$ reduction in validation loss, confirming the framework's fundamental validity and suggesting significant potential gains on larger datasets and deeper training regimes

Motivation: To explore how borrowers without formal credit records can be evaluated to expand fair credit access in Istanbul.

Method: Synthetic dataset was generated using public statistics and OpenAI models, combined with machine learning models (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost) to assess credit evaluation impact using socio demographic and alternative financial attributes.

Result: Alternative financial data usage improved model performance significantly: AUC raised by 1.3% and F1 score by 14%.

Conclusion: Behavioural attributes offer bureau-level discrimination power for underbanked borrowers, supporting lenders and regulators in providing fair credit access.

Abstract: Financial exclusion constrains entrepreneurship, increases income volatility, and widens wealth gaps. Underbanked consumers in Istanbul often have no bureau file because their earnings and payments flow through informal channels. To study how such borrowers can be evaluated we create a synthetic dataset of one hundred thousand Istanbul residents that reproduces first quarter 2025 TÜİK census marginals and telecom usage patterns. Retrieval augmented generation feeds these public statistics into the OpenAI o3 model, which synthesises realistic yet private records. Each profile contains seven socio demographic variables and nine alternative attributes that describe phone specifications, online shopping rhythm, subscription spend, car ownership, monthly rent, and a credit card flag. To test the impact of the alternative financial data CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost are each trained in two versions. Demo models use only the socio demographic variables; Full models include both socio demographic and alternative attributes. Across five fold stratified validation the alternative block raises area under the curve by about one point three percentage and lifts balanced \(F_{1}\) from roughly 0.84 to 0.95, a fourteen percent gain. We contribute an open Istanbul 2025 Q1 synthetic dataset, a fully reproducible modeling pipeline, and empirical evidence that a concise set of behavioural attributes can approach bureau level discrimination power while serving borrowers who lack formal credit records. These findings give lenders and regulators a transparent blueprint for extending fair and safe credit access to the underbanked.

### [458] [Understanding Structured Financial Data with LLMs: A Case Study on Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13040)
*Xuwei Tan,Yao Ma,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach combining feature reduction and retrieval-augmented in-context learning to improve fraud detection in financial transactions using Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the interpretability and reduce the manual work associated with fraud detection, which is traditionally performed using tabular models hindered by high-dimensional data and limited human readability.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework called FinFRE-RAG. This involves importance-guided feature reduction to transform attributes into natural language and retrieval-augmented in-context learning with label-aware exemplars.

Result: Their approach, FinFRE-RAG, outperforms direct prompting with LLMs and achieves competitive results with tabular baselines across multiple datasets while providing interpretable rationales.

Conclusion: FinFRE-RAG shows promise in fraud detection by improving performance and interpretability of LLMs, although it still falls behind specialized classifiers.

Abstract: Detecting fraud in financial transactions typically relies on tabular models that demand heavy feature engineering to handle high-dimensional data and offer limited interpretability, making it difficult for humans to understand predictions. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis.

### [459] [OLC-WA: Drift Aware Tuning-Free Online Classification with Weighted Average](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12785)
*Mohammad Abu Shaira,Yunhe Feng,Heng Fan,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OLC-WA, an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model, uses a weighted average and dynamic optimization to address concept drift, achieving superior performance in real-world dynamic data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data streams often evolve over time, leading to concept drift that impacts model accuracy. Existing models, especially those with fixed hyperparameters, struggle to adapt to this challenge.

Method: OLC-WA blends incoming data streams with a base model using an exponentially weighted moving average and integrates a dynamic optimization mechanism to detect and quantify concept drift and adjust the model accordingly.

Result: OLC-WA demonstrates comparable performance to batch models in stable environments (accuracy within 1-3%) and outperforms leading online models by 10-25% in dynamic data scenarios affected by drift.

Conclusion: OLC-WA proves to be an adaptive and effective solution for handling evolving data distributions, addressing the limitations of static hyperparameter-based models and excelling in streaming environments.

Abstract: Real-world data sets often exhibit temporal dynamics characterized by evolving data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. This paper introduces Online Classification with Weighted Average (OLC-WA), an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model equipped with an automated optimization mechanism. OLC-WA operates by blending incoming data streams with an existing base model. This blending is facilitated by an exponentially weighted moving average. Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments. Rigorous empirical evaluation across diverse benchmark datasets shows that OLC-WA achieves performance comparable to batch models in stationary environments, maintaining accuracy within 1-3%, and surpasses leading online baselines by 10-25% under drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to dynamic data streams.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates statistical tests for comparing multiple learning algorithms on various datasets, focusing on online regression models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of robust statistical methods to compare multiple machine learning algorithms across various datasets, especially in online learning setups.

Method: The study evaluates online regression models using the Friedman test, post-hoc tests, and analysis on real and synthetic datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and seed averaging.

Result: The tests validated the competitiveness of baseline algorithms but revealed potential areas for improvement in state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Effective statistical methods are crucial for comparing online learning models, but further refinement in current methodologies is needed to address their limitations.

Abstract: Despite extensive focus on techniques for evaluating the performance of two learning algorithms on a single dataset, the critical challenge of developing statistical tests to compare multiple algorithms across various datasets has been largely overlooked in most machine learning research. Additionally, in the realm of Online Learning, ensuring statistical significance is essential to validate continuous learning processes, particularly for achieving rapid convergence and effectively managing concept drifts in a timely manner. Robust statistical methods are needed to assess the significance of performance differences as data evolves over time. This article examines the state-of-the-art online regression models and empirically evaluates several suitable tests. To compare multiple online regression models across various datasets, we employed the Friedman test along with corresponding post-hoc tests. For thorough evaluations, utilizing both real and synthetic datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and seed averaging ensures comprehensive assessment across various data subsets. Our tests generally confirmed the performance of competitive baselines as consistent with their individual reports. However, some statistical test results also indicate that there is still room for improvement in certain aspects of state-of-the-art methods.

*Shivansh Sahni,Wenzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel transformer, the LRT, which adaptively adjusts computation depth for structured reasoning tasks, achieving high accuracy on Sudoku and discussing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors wanted to create a transformer architecture capable of adaptive computation depth for reasoning tasks, aiming to efficiently handle structured problems like Sudoku and chess.

Method: They introduced LRT, leveraging iterative updates with recurrent tokens, discard-based correction, and learned stopping mechanisms. The model dynamically adjusts its computational depth based on input difficulty.

Result: Strong performance was observed with 98.68% digit accuracy and 36.30% full-puzzle accuracy on Sudoku. Gates for discard and stopping were shown to stabilize inferences and adjust computational depth effectively.

Conclusion: The LRT demonstrates the potential of adaptive transformers in structured reasoning, and provides insights into scaling methods for larger and more complex domains like chess.

Abstract: The Liquid Reasoning Transformer (LRT) is a transformer architecture designed for inference with adaptive depths using iterative changes, discard-based correction, and a learned stopping mechanism. Instead of relying on a single feedforward pass, the model updates a recurrent reasoning token across multiple internal steps, allowing it to correct early errors and allocate computation based on input difficulty. We evaluate the LRT on Sudoku as a controlled testbed for structured reasoning and show that it achieves strong performance, reaching 98.68% digit accuracy and 36.30% full-puzzle accuracy without using symbolic rules or search. Analyzing internal patterns shows that the discard and stop gates play different, important roles in stabilizing inferences and adjusting computational depth. We discuss how these mechanisms extend naturally to chess-scale reasoning tasks and outline extensions for multi-token reasoning and larger domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACER, a framework for adapting clinical decision support tools amidst population shifts due to operational updates or emergent diseases. TRACER enhances model performance without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision tools often face performance issues due to shifts in patient populations following system updates or disease outbreaks, demanding robust approaches to handle these changes.

Method: TRACER uses transfer learning for real-time model adaptation, identifying encounter-level transitions without requiring full model retraining.

Result: Simulation studies showed TRACER outperforming static models. It also improved discrimination and calibration in predicting hospital admissions across COVID-19 transitions.

Conclusion: TRACER is a scalable framework, ensuring robust predictive performance during changes in clinical and patient conditions.

Abstract: Clinical decision support tools built on electronic health records often experience performance drift due to temporal population shifts, particularly when changes in the clinical environment initially affect only a subset of patients, resulting in a transition to mixed populations. Such case-mix changes commonly arise following system-level operational updates or the emergence of new diseases, such as COVID-19. We propose TRACER (Transfer Learning-based Real-time Adaptation for Clinical Evolving Risk), a framework that identifies encounter-level transition membership and adapts predictive models using transfer learning without full retraining. In simulation studies, TRACER outperformed static models trained on historical or contemporary data. In a real-world application predicting hospital admission following emergency department visits across the COVID-19 transition, TRACER improved both discrimination and calibration. TRACER provides a scalable approach for maintaining robust predictive performance under evolving and heterogeneous clinical conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores the size generalization property of transformers and provides a theoretical framework to analyze it for geometric data, illustrated by point clouds and graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous theoretical understanding behind the size generalization phenomena of transformers observed in diverse applications such as in geometric data representation.

Method: The authors formulated a bound on the error between the transformer's outputs for discrete samples and their continuous domains. This analysis is based on the sampling density and intrinsic dimensionality while showing stability with respect to stable positional encodings.

Result: Theoretical bounds derived in the paper show consistency and were validated through experiments on various sizes of graphs and point clouds, demonstrating alignment with the theoretical framework.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous theoretical insight into the size generalization ability of transformers on geometric data, highlighting the determining factors such as sampling density and data manifold dimensionality.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit a notable property of \emph{size generalization}, demonstrating an ability to extrapolate from smaller token sets to significantly longer ones. This behavior has been documented across diverse applications, including point clouds, graphs, and natural language. Despite its empirical success, this capability still lacks some rigorous theoretical characterizations. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze this phenomenon for geometric data, which we represent as discrete samples from a continuous source (e.g., point clouds from manifolds, graphs from graphons). Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent. We prove that for Transformers with stable positional encodings, this bound is determined by the sampling density and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Experiments on graphs and point clouds of various sizes confirm the tightness of our theoretical bound.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on integrating Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) into the pipeline of extracting training data from Large Language Models (LLMs) to benchmark their effectiveness and practical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the privacy risks posed by LLMs due to their tendency to memorize training data, specifically in the context of training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).

Method: The study integrates multiple MIA techniques into a data extraction pipeline, benchmarks their efficacy, and compares their real-world performance against conventional MIA benchmarks.

Result: The integrated evaluation framework provides insights into the effectiveness of MIAs in real-world scenarios, offering a systematic comparison with traditional MIA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a comprehensive benchmark approach to evaluate the utility of MIAs in practical extraction scenarios, highlighting privacy vulnerabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to memorizing training data, which poses serious privacy risks. Two of the most prominent concerns are training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Prior research has shown that these threats are interconnected: adversaries can extract training data from an LLM by querying the model to generate a large volume of text and subsequently applying MIAs to verify whether a particular data point was included in the training set. In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios.

*Hasan Burhan Beytur,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo,Kevin S Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores cost-efficient resource allocation for ML training and deployment under concept drift and budget constraints, proposing a model-agnostic framework and optimal solutions for different concept drift dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address resource allocation challenges under concept drift and limited budgets for ML model providers serving clients who cannot retrain models locally.

Method: Development of a model-agnostic framework, analysis of training policies based on concept drift dynamics (DMRL and IMRL), and proposal of strategies under communication constraints.

Result: Optimal training policies are derived for sudden concept changes, proving heuristics’ effectiveness depends on drift dynamics. Additionally, quasi-convex optimization for deployment is achieved through a randomized scheduling strategy.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and practical tools for cost-efficient ML model resource management in scenarios involving concept drift, aiding adaptive and distributed ML systems.

Abstract: We study how to allocate resources for training and deployment of machine learning (ML) models under concept drift and limited budgets. We consider a setting in which a model provider distributes trained models to multiple clients whose devices support local inference but lack the ability to retrain those models, placing the burden of performance maintenance on the provider. We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance. These results offer theoretical and algorithmic foundations for cost-efficient ML model management under concept drift, with implications for continual learning, distributed inference, and adaptive ML systems.

*Congzhou M Sha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates a topological constraint in flow matching for generative modeling, particularly when prior and target distributions have mismatched topologies, leading to discontinuities in optimal velocity fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the topological limitations of flow matching when prior and target distributions have mismatched structures, such as unimodal to multimodal transformations.

Method: Theoretical analysis is conducted on bimodal Gaussian mixtures to study spatial discontinuities in the velocity field. Empirical validation and discussion on potential ramifications in flow matching setups are also provided.

Result: The study finds that discontinuities occur in the velocity field during flow matching due to topological mismatches, with discontinuities magnifying as time approaches the target distribution.

Conclusion: Topological mismatch in distributions inherently challenges flow matching, particularly the learning of discontinuous representations, and this has implications for generative modeling frameworks on manifolds.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling through continuous normalizing flows. We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric-based method using Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) to detect adversarial attacks on deep neural networks, achieving high detection rates on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure robustness and reliability of deep neural networks in critical applications by developing a method to detect adversarial perturbations effectively.

Method: Analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of a model's loss gradient parameters to distinguish between natural and adversarial data, leveraging the differences as the basis for adversarial detection.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates its efficacy in detecting adversarial attacks, achieving over 92% detection accuracy on CIFAR-10 and outperforming existing methods across multiple datasets and attack types.

Conclusion: Intrinsic Dimensionality serves as a robust identifier for detecting adversarial attacks, proving effective across diverse scenarios and datasets.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, deep neural networks exhibit a critical vulnerability: small, often imperceptible, adversarial perturbations can lead to drastically altered model predictions. Given the stringent reliability demands of applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, robust detection of such adversarial attacks is paramount. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of a model's input loss landscape. We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method. We validate our approach across two distinct operational scenarios. First, in a batch-wise context for identifying malicious data groups, our method demonstrates high efficacy on datasets like MNIST and SVHN. Second, in the critical individual-sample setting, we establish new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and MS COCO. Our detector significantly surpasses existing methods against a wide array of attacks, including CW and AutoAttack, achieving detection rates consistently above 92\% on CIFAR-10. The results underscore the robustness of our geometric approach, highlighting that intrinsic dimensionality is a powerful fingerprint for adversarial detection across diverse datasets and attack strategies.

*Kaustav Chatterjee,Joshua Li,Kundan Parajulee,Jared Schwennesen*

TL;DR: This paper addresses safety risks at Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs) caused by low-clearance vehicles becoming stranded on tracks, by developing a deep learning framework to evaluate hangup susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address safety concerns at HRGCs, where vehicles with low ground clearance may become stranded on tracks, leading to potential collisions with trains.

Method: The researchers collected profile data from HRGCs using advanced sensing systems, developed a hybrid LSTM-Transformer deep learning model to reconstruct HRGC profiles accurately, and analyzed vehicle dimensions under different statistical scenarios to identify hangup risks.

Result: The study identified 36, 62, and 67 high-risk crossings under median, 75-25 percentile, and worst-case vehicle dimension scenarios, respectively. An ArcGIS database and software were created to help mitigate these hazards.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced sensing, deep learning, and vehicle data into decision-support tools can significantly enhance the evaluation and mitigation of safety risks at HRGCs, aiding transportation agencies in proactive hazard management.

Abstract: Steep profiled Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs) pose safety hazards to vehicles with low ground clearance, which may become stranded on the tracks, creating risks of train vehicle collisions. This research develops a framework for network level evaluation of hangup susceptibility of HRGCs. Profile data from different crossings in Oklahoma were collected using both a walking profiler and the Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System. A hybrid deep learning model, combining Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures, was developed to reconstruct accurate HRGC profiles from Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System data. Vehicle dimension data from around 350 specialty vehicles were collected at various locations across Oklahoma to enable up to date statistical design dimensions. Hangup susceptibility was analyzed using three vehicle dimension scenarios (a) median dimension (median wheelbase and ground clearance), (b) 75 25 percentile dimension (75 percentile wheelbase, 25 percentile ground clearance), and (c) worst case dimension (maximum wheelbase and minimum ground clearance). Results indicate 36, 62, and 67 crossings at the highest hangup risk levels under these scenarios, respectively. An ArcGIS database and a software interface were developed to support transportation agencies in mitigating crossing hazards. This framework advances safety evaluation by integrating next generation sensing, deep learning, and infrastructure datasets into practical decision support tools.

*Sindhuja Madabushi,Ahmad Faraz Khan,Haider Ali,Ananthram Swami,Rui Ning,Hongyi Wu,Jin-Hee Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRIVEE, a method for enhancing privacy in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) against feature inference attacks by transforming confidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in VFL, where shared confidence scores can be exploited to infer private input features, thereby threatening data confidentiality.

Method: PRIVEE proposes transforming confidence scores to obfuscate sensitive data while maintaining key properties like relative ranking and inter-score distances. Only transformed scores are shared.

Result: Extensive experiments indicate PRIVEE achieves a threefold improvement in privacy protection compared to leading defenses, without compromising model prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: PRIVEE effectively mitigates privacy risks in VFL, offering enhanced protection against inference attacks while maintaining full predictive performance.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training across organizations that share common user samples but hold disjoint feature spaces. Despite its potential, VFL is susceptible to feature inference attacks, in which adversarial parties exploit shared confidence scores (i.e., prediction probabilities) during inference to reconstruct private input features of other participants. To counter this threat, we propose PRIVEE (PRIvacy-preserving Vertical fEderated lEarning), a novel defense mechanism named after the French word privée, meaning "private." PRIVEE obfuscates confidence scores while preserving critical properties such as relative ranking and inter-score distances. Rather than exposing raw scores, PRIVEE shares only the transformed representations, mitigating the risk of reconstruction attacks without degrading model prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that PRIVEE achieves a threefold improvement in privacy protection compared to state-of-the-art defenses, while preserving full predictive performance against advanced feature inference attacks.

### [470] [Selective Conformal Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12844)
*Yunpeng Xu,Wenge Guo,Zhi Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective Conformal Risk Control (SCRC), a framework combining conformal prediction and selective classification to improve uncertainty quantification, yielding tighter prediction sets without compromising coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance uncertainty quantification methods like conformal prediction, which often yield overly large prediction sets, thus limiting their practical application in critical machine learning domains.

Method: The proposed method, SCRC, formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage process: selecting confident samples and then applying conformal risk control on them. Two algorithms, SCRC-T and SCRC-I, are developed, providing exact and probabilistic guarantees respectively.

Result: The algorithms were tested on two datasets, successfully achieving target coverage and risk levels. SCRC-I was slightly conservative but demonstrated better computational efficiency compared to SCRC-T.

Conclusion: SCRC provides an efficient approach to produce smaller, reliable prediction sets for uncertainty quantification, making it practical for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying machine learning systems in high-stakes domains. Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees but often produces overly large prediction sets, limiting its practical utility. To address this issue, we propose \textit{Selective Conformal Risk Control} (SCRC), a unified framework that integrates conformal prediction with selective classification. The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient. Experiments on two public datasets show that both methods achieve the target coverage and risk levels, with nearly identical performance, while SCRC-I exhibits slightly more conservative risk control but superior computational practicality. Our results demonstrate that selective conformal risk control offers an effective and efficient path toward compact, reliable uncertainty quantification.

*Sonal Prabhune,Balaji Padmanabhan,Kaushik Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance the consistency of information delivery by Large Language Models (LLMs) when handling semantically equivalent prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency of responses by LLMs when minor variations in semantically equivalent prompts impact trust, compliance, and user experience, especially in enterprise applications requiring stability.

Method: The study employs GRPO with entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards to train models for higher consistency. It isolates phrasing effects by resetting conversational contexts and optimizing for stability across equivalent prompts.

Result: Experiments on tasks like investment and job recommendations demonstrate that the GRPO-trained model achieves significantly reduced response variability when compared to fine-tuning and decoding-focused methods.

Conclusion: The paper positions GRPO as an effective method for correcting variability in LLMs, reframing it as a flaw in enterprise applications, and enhancing consistency as a critical requirement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in business-critical domains such as finance, education, healthcare, and customer support, where users expect consistent and reliable recommendations. Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to enhance Active Learning (AL) by reducing label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AL faces challenges due to noisy labels caused by varying labeler accuracy, especially with uncertain samples.

Method: Introduces an assignment model optimizing labeler selection and a new sampling method to counteract label noise.

Result: Achieves improved classification performance over benchmark methods.

Conclusion: Utilizing noise-minimization strategies bolsters the effectiveness of AL frameworks and their resulting classifiers.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has garnered significant interest across various application domains where labeling training data is costly. AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to several benchmark methods.

*Mohammadmahdi Nouriborji,Morteza Rohanian,Omid Rohanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mechanism called Mixture of LoRAs (MoL) to address limitations caused by parameter sharing in recursive transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance with compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter sharing in recursive transformers reduces model size but weakens the expressivity of layers, which requires solutions to maintain performance without increasing complexity.

Method: The authors propose MoL, a conditional computation model that inserts LoRA experts within shared FFNs, combined with enhancements like rotary embeddings and distillation-based initialization in a recursive architecture called ModernALBERT.

Result: ModernALBERT equipped with MoL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks such as GLUE, SQuAD-v2, and BEIR, performing better than larger models with full parameterization.

Conclusion: Conditional weight-space modulation via MoL is an effective strategy to preserve expressivity in compact recursive models, offering performance improvements in pretraining and efficient inference.

Abstract: Parameter sharing in recursive transformers reduces model size but collapses layer-wise expressivity. We propose Mixture of LoRAs (MoL), a lightweight conditional-computation mechanism that inserts Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts inside a shared feed-forward network (FFN). MoL enables token-conditional weight-space modulation of the shared FFN without untying backbone parameters, unlike prior approaches that add fixed or externally attached adapters. We pretrain a modernised recursive architecture, ModernALBERT, integrating rotary embeddings, GeGLU, FlashAttention, and a distillation-based initialisation. Across GLUE, SQuAD-v2, and BEIR, ModernALBERT (50M--120M) achieves state-of-the-art performance among compact models and surpasses larger fully parameterised baselines. We also propose an expert-merging procedure that compresses MoL into a single adapter at inference while preserving accuracy, enabling efficient deployment. Our results show that conditional weight-space modulation effectively restores the expressivity lost under aggressive parameter sharing in recursive transformers.

### [474] [Distillation of Discrete Diffusion by Exact Conditional Distribution Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12889)
*Yansong Gao,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distillation technique to accelerate discrete diffusion models by directly matching conditional distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many discrete diffusion models require significant computation for inference, creating a need for methods to shorten the sampling process without relying on approximate simulators or complex distillation schemes.

Method: The authors utilize conditional distribution matching, leveraging the Markov decomposition of reverse conditional distributions and predefined density ratios to design simplified distillation objectives.

Result: Their approach enables the creation of low-function-evaluation-count (low-NFE) student models that closely match the conditional distributions of pre-trained teacher models.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation framework effectively accelerates inference in discrete diffusion models, providing a principled and simplified solution for faster generation of categorical data.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) are a powerful class of generative models for categorical data, but they typically require many function evaluations for a single sample, making inference expensive. Existing acceleration methods either rely on approximate simulators, such as $τ$-leaping, or on distillation schemes that train new student models and auxiliary networks with proxy objectives. We propose a simple and principled distillation alternative based on \emph{conditional distribution matching}. Our key observation is that the reverse conditional distribution of clean data given a noisy state, $p_{0\mid t}(x_0 \mid x_t)$, admits a Markov decomposition through intermediate times and can be recovered from marginal density ratios and the known forward CTMC kernel. We exploit this structure to define distillation objectives that directly match conditional distributions between a pre-trained teacher and a low-NFE student, both for one-step and few-step samplers.

*Charilaos Pipis,Shivam Garg,Vasilis Kontonis,Vaishnavi Shrivastava,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why reasoning models loop during long chains of thoughts, particularly at lower temperatures, and finds that errors in learning and the model's inductive biases are key contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of looping in reasoning models while generating longer chains of thought, which impairs their ability to solve harder problems effectively.

Method: The authors analyze open reasoning models, introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task, and study mechanisms like hardness of learning and inductive biases to identify causes of looping. They also examine the effect of temperature and larger models.

Result: They find that larger models loop less, errors in learning cause looping, and Transformers exhibit inductive biases leading to repeated actions. Lower temperatures exacerbate the issue, while higher temperatures mitigate it but lead to overly lengthy generations.

Conclusion: Temperature adjustments provide temporary relief but do not address underlying learning errors. Training interventions are needed to reduce errors directly and improve model reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to predict complex traffic scenarios using Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG) and compares model-based and machine-learning approaches for computation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model uncertainties in traffic participant behavior for improving vehicle safety systems such as criticality estimation and trajectory planning.

Method: Introduced Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POGs) as a probabilistic representation using a model-based approach initially, then transitioned to a machine-learning method using augmented occupancy grid cells and Random Forest algorithm.

Result: Simulations show that the machine-learning method significantly reduces computational load compared to the model-based approach, indicating its potential for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The machine-learning approach to POG computation improves efficiency and can enhance vehicle safety systems by enabling real-time modeling of traffic uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to predict the evolution of a complex traffic scenario with multiple objects. The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications. With this detailed modelling of uncertainties, crucial components in vehicle safety systems like criticality estimation and trajectory planning can be improved.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve active vehicle safety by predicting future behaviors of traffic participants in complex scenarios via probabilistic modeling.

Method: A hierarchical classifier is used to identify traffic types; Random Forests predict behavior using Augmented Occupancy Grids reduced to low-dimensional features by a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments show the machine learning approach is effective and accurate.

Conclusion: The method successfully aids in estimating traffic scenario criticality and determining safe vehicle trajectories.

Abstract: In this paper, a probabilistic space-time representation of complex traffic scenarios is predicted using machine learning algorithms. Such a representation is significant for all active vehicle safety applications especially when performing dynamic maneuvers in a complex traffic scenario. As a first step, a hierarchical situation classifier is used to distinguish the different types of traffic scenarios. This classifier is responsible for identifying the type of the road infrastructure and the safety-relevant traffic participants of the driving environment. With each class representing similar traffic scenarios, a set of Random Forests (RFs) is individually trained to predict the probabilistic space-time representation, which depicts the future behavior of traffic participants. This representation is termed as a Predicted-Occupancy Grid (POG). The input to the RFs is an Augmented Occupancy Grid (AOG). In order to increase the learning accuracy of the RFs and to perform better predictions, the AOG is reduced to low-dimensional features using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). The excellent performance of the proposed machine learning approach consisting of SDAs and RFs is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with real vehicles. An application of POGs to estimate the criticality of traffic scenarios and to determine safe trajectories is also presented.

Motivation: The research aims to validate the wider computational applicability of NG-RC, as previous studies were limited to temporal waveform predictions, leaving its classification capability unexplored.

Method: NG-RC's computational framework is tested on classification tasks to evaluate its performance compared to conventional reservoir computing (RC).

Result: It is demonstrated that NG-RC performs classification tasks as effectively as traditional RC, proving its adaptability for multiple computational problems.

Conclusion: NG-RC is a versatile paradigm capable of handling both prediction and classification tasks, establishing itself as a strong alternative to traditional RC approaches.

Abstract: An emerging computing paradigm, so-called next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) is investigated. True to its namesake, NG-RC requires no actual reservoirs for input data mixing but rather computing the polynomial terms directly from the time series inputs. However, benchmark tests so far reported have been one-sided, limited to prediction tasks of temporal waveforms such as Lorenz 63 attractor and Mackey-Glass chaotic signal. We will demonstrate for the first time that NG-RC can perform classification task as good as conventional RC. This validates the versatile computational capability of NG-RC in tasks of both prediction and classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for influence-guided data pruning to reduce computational costs in biological foundation models (BioFMs), while demonstrating its effectiveness through empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BioFMs require significant computational resources due to large-scale datasets, creating accessibility issues for many academic labs, motivating the need for efficient data pruning techniques.

Method: The proposed framework uses a subset-based self-influence approach to rank biological sequence importance, coupled with selection strategies (Top I and CCI) to prune data while maintaining performance.

Result: The method outperformed random selection baselines, achieving extreme pruning rates (>99%) for RNA-FM and showing generalizability with protein tasks, showcasing redundancy in biological datasets.

Conclusion: This influence-guided pruning method reduces BioFM pretraining costs significantly and promotes sustainable and accessible biological AI research.

Abstract: Biological foundation models (BioFMs), pretrained on large-scale biological sequences, have recently shown strong potential in providing meaningful representations for diverse downstream bioinformatics tasks. However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research.

Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the significant storage challenges posed by the large file size of Cryo-EM data, which is essential for facilitating its use in research and education.

Method: The method involves extracting a binary map based on density thresholds, compressing repetitive density maps using GZIP, and encoding spatial density information with a neural network involving positional encoding and a weighted MSE loss function.

Result: The proposed approach achieves efficient compression of Cryo-EM data while maintaining reasonable reconstruction quality and a good compression ratio.

Conclusion: This deep learning-based compression method provides a practical solution for biological data storage, offering utility for educational and research purposes while balancing file size and quality.

Abstract: Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) has become an essential tool for capturing high-resolution biological structures. Despite its advantage in visualizations, the large storage size of Cryo-EM data file poses significant challenges for researchers and educators. This paper investigates the application of deep learning, specifically implicit neural representation (INR), to compress Cryo-EM biological data. The proposed approach first extracts the binary map of each file according to the density threshold. The density map is highly repetitive, ehich can be effectively compressed by GZIP. The neural network then trains to encode spatial density information, allowing the storage of network parameters and learnable latent vectors. To improve reconstruction accuracy, I further incorporate the positional encoding to enhance spatial representation and a weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to balance density distribution variations. Using this approach, my aim is to provide a practical and efficient biological data compression solution that can be used for educational and research purpose, while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and reconstruction quality from file to file.

*Hassan Iftikhar,Rizwan Ahmad,Arunark Kolipaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIME, a deep-learning framework to improve shear stiffness mapping in MRE, overcoming limitations of the traditional MMDI method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the accuracy and reliability issues in Magnetic Resonance Elastography stiffness estimation caused by assumptions of the Helmholtz equation and Laplacian operator sensitivity to noise.

Method: Developed DIME, a deep-learning framework trained on FEM-simulated displacement fields and stiffness maps, utilizing patch-based training for enhanced robustness.

Result: DIME demonstrated superior stiffness estimation accuracy, minimal bias, and fidelity to ground truth in both simulation and real patient datasets, outperforming MMDI.

Conclusion: DIME has the potential for clinical applications in MRE, providing higher reliability and accuracy compared to existing methods using MMDI.

Abstract: The Multimodal Direct Inversion (MMDI) algorithm is widely used in Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) to estimate tissue shear stiffness. However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE.

Result: Theoretical performance is comparable to Adam, with numerical studies showing reduced memory and improved robustness in training large NLP models.

Conclusion: Alada is a scalable and memory-efficient alternative to traditional optimization methods like Adam, suitable for large-scale modeling tasks.

Abstract: This work proposes Alada, an adaptive momentum method for stochastic optimization over large-scale matrices. Alada employs a rank-one factorization approach to estimate the second moment of gradients, where factors are updated alternatively to minimize the estimation error. Alada achieves sublinear memory overheads and can be readily extended to optimizing tensor-shaped variables.We also equip Alada with a first moment estimation rule, which enhances the algorithm's robustness without incurring additional memory overheads. The theoretical performance of Alada aligns with that of traditional methods such as Adam. Numerical studies conducted on several natural language processing tasks demonstrate the reduction in memory overheads and the robustness in training large models relative to Adam and its variants.

Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies and challenges in scheduling and resource management during ETL processes in complex, heterogeneous data environments.

Method: A deep Q-learning based framework is designed, utilizing Markov Decision Process formalization, adaptive reinforcement learning agents, and multi-objective reward functions to optimize task scheduling dynamically.

Result: The framework significantly reduces scheduling delays, improves throughput, stabilizes execution, and performs robustly under varying conditions.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning techniques, particularly deep Q-learning, provide effective solutions for optimizing ETL scheduling and resource allocation in complex data environments, offering scalable and efficient strategies for intelligent data pipeline management.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of low scheduling efficiency, unbalanced resource allocation, and poor adaptability in ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) processes under heterogeneous data environments by proposing an intelligent scheduling optimization framework based on deep Q-learning. The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale. Experimental results show that the proposed deep Q-learning scheduling framework significantly reduces scheduling delay, improves system throughput, and enhances execution stability under multi-source heterogeneous task conditions, demonstrating the strong potential of reinforcement learning in complex data scheduling and resource management, and providing an efficient and scalable optimization strategy for intelligent data pipeline construction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LikeBench, a framework for evaluating LLM personalization beyond memory recall and application, focusing on likability across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM personalization benchmarks primarily assess memory recall and task performance, but neglect the subjective aspect of likability, which is crucial for user experience.

Method: LikeBench, a dynamic multi-session evaluation framework, involves simulated user interactions to measure likability across seven dimensions and uses descriptive personas for realistic assessments.

Result: Benchmark results reveal that likability does not necessarily correlate with memory accuracy; models can have high memory performance but still struggle in adapting responses to user preferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of evaluating likability alongside memory in LLMs, providing diagnostic metrics to pinpoint deficiencies and improve user-focused model adaptations.

Abstract: A personalized LLM should remember user facts, apply them correctly, and adapt over time to provide responses that the user prefers. Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TraPO, a semi-supervised reinforcement learning method leveraging limited labeled samples to guide unsupervised training, achieving high data efficiency and outperforming fully supervised approaches in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high annotation costs in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and mitigate model collapse when using unsupervised methods reliant on internal consistency.

Method: The authors propose TraPO, a policy optimization algorithm that matches unlabeled sample learning trajectories with labeled ones to stabilize training and incorporate reasoning patterns verified on labeled samples.

Result: TraPO achieved a 42.6% average accuracy on reasoning benchmarks with minimal labeled samples, outperforming both best unsupervised models and fully supervised models on the same datasets using significantly fewer labeled data.

Conclusion: TraPO effectively integrates semi-supervised training in RLVR, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency and generalization capabilities, making it a valuable approach for training large reasoning models with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in training large reasoning models (LRMs) by leveraging answer-verifiable signals to guide policy optimization, which, however, suffers from high annotation costs. To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data. The code is available via https://github.com/ShenzhiYang2000/TRAPO.

Motivation: Challenges like hyperparameter tuning and overfitting persist in neural networks; Bayesian methods can address these by integrating uncertainty into models.

Method: The proposed method applies a Gaussian-inverse-Wishart distribution as a hyperprior for weights, enabling closed-form calculations of Student's t-distributions with linear complexity.

Result: HABNN effectively tackles overfitting and gives reliable uncertainty estimates, excelling in out-of-distribution data tasks and outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HABNN offers a robust framework with significant accuracy and performance for future applications, particularly in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have revolutionized various domains, yet challenges such as hyperparameter tuning and overfitting remain significant hurdles. Bayesian neural networks offer a framework to address these challenges by incorporating uncertainty directly into the model, yielding more reliable predictions, particularly for out-of-distribution data. This paper presents Hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Neural Network, a novel approach that uses a Gaussian-inverse-Wishart distribution as a hyperprior of the network's weights to increase both the robustness and performance of the model. We provide analytical representations for the predictive distribution and weight posterior, which amount to the calculation of the parameters of Student's t-distributions in closed form with linear complexity with respect to the number of weights. Our method demonstrates robust performance, effectively addressing issues of overfitting and providing reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly for out-of-distribution tasks. Experimental results indicate that HABNN not only matches but often outperforms state-of-the-art models, suggesting a promising direction for future applications in safety-critical environments.

Motivation: To automate the complex process of deconvolution (peak identification and quantification) in spectra analysis using advanced techniques like quantum computing.

Method: Implementing an interpretable Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanvNN) architecture compared directly to classical CNNs, and testing on a synthetic NMR-inspired dataset.

Result: QuanvNNs outperform classical CNNs with an 11% improvement in F1 score and a 30% reduction in mean absolute error for peak position estimation, with better convergence stability.

Conclusion: QuanvNNs show significant advantages over classical CNNs in solving the multi-task peak finding problem, highlighting potential for quantum computing in spectra analysis.

Abstract: The analysis of spectra, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra, for the comprehensive characterization of peaks is a challenging task for both experts and machines, especially with complex molecules. This process, also known as deconvolution, involves identifying and quantifying the peaks in the spectrum. Machine learning techniques have shown promising results in automating this process. With the advent of quantum computing, there is potential to further enhance these techniques. In this work, inspired by the success of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we explore the use of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuanvNNs) for the multi-task peak finding problem, involving both peak counting and position estimation. We implement a simple and interpretable QuanvNN architecture that can be directly compared to its classical CNN counterpart, and evaluate its performance on a synthetic NMR-inspired dataset. Our results demonstrate that QuanvNNs outperform classical CNNs on challenging spectra, achieving an 11\% improvement in F1 score and a 30\% reduction in mean absolute error for peak position estimation. Additionally, QuanvNNs appear to exhibit better convergence stability for harder problems.

*Jakub Łyskawa,Jakub Lewandowski,Paweł Wawrzyński*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a stable way to integrate n-step returns into Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) without introducing bias or numerical instability and validates the approach experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the convergence speed of SAC, a model-free reinforcement learning method, by overcoming challenges in combining it with n-step returns, such as bias and numerical instability.

Method: The authors propose numerically stable importance sampling, simplify hyperparameter selection, introduce a $τ$-sampled entropy estimation method to reduce variance, and develop the SAC$n$ algorithm.

Result: The proposed SAC$n$ algorithm is validated through experiments on MuJoCo simulated environments, confirming its practicality and improved performance.

Conclusion: The integration of stable n-step returns into SAC enhances the algorithm's efficiency and convergence while mitigating issues like bias and instability.

Abstract: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is widely used in practical applications and is now one of the most relevant off-policy online model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods. The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $τ$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target. Finally, we formulate the Soft Actor-Critic with n-step returns (SAC$n$) algorithm that we experimentally verify on MuJoCo simulated environments.

*Khalid Ferji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolySet, a framework that accounts for the statistical nature of polymers by representing them as weighted ensembles of chains derived from molar-mass distributions, improving ML model accuracy and stability for polymers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current ML models in polymer science that treat polymers as perfectly defined single molecular graphs, disregarding their stochastic, distributed-chain nature in real materials.

Method: Developed PolySet, a framework that encodes polymers as finite, weighted ensembles of chains, considering molar-mass distributions and implementing it with a minimal language model for homopolymers.

Result: PolySet enables ML models to retain higher-order distributional moments (e.g., Mz, Mz+1) and significantly improves the stability and accuracy of predicting tail-sensitive properties.

Conclusion: PolySet provides a physically grounded approach to polymer machine learning, which is extensible to complex polymer architectures and topologies, offering a foundation for more realistic modeling in the field.

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models in polymer science typically treat a polymer as a single, perfectly defined molecular graph, even though real materials consist of stochastic ensembles of chains with distributed lengths. This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies.

*Jin Sob Kim,Hyun Joon Park,Wooseok Shin,Dongil Park,Sung Won Han*

TL;DR: This paper introduces the WAY framework using AIS data for predicting vessel destinations long-term, overcoming AIS reliability constraints with innovations like nested sequence structures, CASP blocks, and Gradient Dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIS data has issues such as reliability and irregular intervals, necessitating innovative methods for accurate long-term maritime surveillance and vessel destination estimation.

Method: The paper reformulates port-to-port AIS trajectories into nested spatial grid sequences and introduces WAY, a deep learning model with trajectory representation layers and CASP blocks for aggregative sequential data processing. Gradient Dropout is also introduced for enhanced training.

Result: WAY demonstrates superiority in destination prediction tasks on 5-year AIS data compared to conventional approaches, with improved generalization and performance through Gradient Dropout. Multitask learning for ETA estimation is also explored.

Conclusion: WAY provides a robust solution for long-term vessel destination estimation with improved accuracy and applicability in real-world maritime scenarios.

Abstract: The Automatic Identification System (AIS) enables data-driven maritime surveillance but suffers from reliability issues and irregular intervals. We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation.

### [493] [Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Federated Learning for Temperature Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13207)
*Karina Chichifoi,Fabio Merizzi,Michele Colajanni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how deep learning and federated learning enhance weather forecasting but face vulnerabilities like data poisoning due to adversarial clients. Attacks significantly distort predictions, especially in spatially dependent meteorological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to leverage deep learning and FL to improve weather forecasting efficiency while addressing inherent security concerns such as data sharing and malicious attacks.

Method: A simulation approach evaluates geographically distributed clients using patch-based and global data poisoning attacks on temperature forecasting with the CERRA dataset.

Result: Findings show single compromised clients can cause significant biases, and coordinated attacks exacerbate forecast errors. Defense via trimmed mean aggregation mitigates global biases but is ineffective against spatially linked data poisoning.

Conclusion: Despite the benefits of FL, vulnerabilities like spatially correlated data poisoning remain a severe threat to model reliability. Outlier-based defenses are inadequate against such attacks, necessitating further advancements in FL security.

Abstract: Deep learning and federated learning (FL) are becoming powerful partners for next-generation weather forecasting. Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces CORE, a novel framework integrating masked feature reconstruction and contrastive learning for graph self-supervised learning, achieving superior task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical connection between generative and contrastive approaches for graph self-supervised learning and leverage their complementary nature.

Method: Developed CORE framework combining masked feature reconstruction (MFR) with graph contrastive learning (GCL) using positive pairs and masked nodes as negative samples.

Result: CORE surpasses existing models like GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 in node classification tasks by up to 2.80-3.72% and in graph classification tasks by up to 3.76-3.82%.

Conclusion: CORE integrates reconstructive and discriminative abilities of MFR and GCL, representing a state-of-the-art advancement in graph self-supervised learning.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of self-supervised learning on graphs, generative and contrastive methodologies have emerged as two dominant approaches. Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks.

### [496] [Learning to Retrieve with Weakened Labels: Robust Training under Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13237)
*Arnab Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a label weakening approach to enhance dense retrieval models' performance by addressing label noise issues in training data, demonstrating improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse annotation and label noise in training data pose challenges for training neural encoders for dense retrieval tasks, and existing solutions add complexity or require extensive tuning.

Method: The authors propose a label weakening technique, which allows for a set of plausible labels derived from observed supervision and model confidence scores, instead of using single, error-prone labels.

Result: The approach is evaluated on two retrieval models and a re-ranking model across four datasets under noisy conditions, showing improved retrieval task performance compared to 10 state-of-the-art loss functions.

Conclusion: Label weakening provides a robust and effective way to handle label noise, enhancing retrieval model performance without increasing complexity or tuning requirements.

Abstract: Neural Encoders are frequently used in the NLP domain to perform dense retrieval tasks, for instance, to generate the candidate documents for a given query in question-answering tasks. However, sparse annotation and label noise in the training data make it challenging to train or fine-tune such retrieval models. Although existing works have attempted to mitigate these problems by incorporating modified loss functions or data cleaning, these approaches either require some hyperparameters to tune during training or add substantial complexity to the training setup. In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise. Our initial results show that label weakening can improve the performance of the retrieval tasks in comparison to 10 different state-of-the-art loss functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore lightweight methods for faster sampling in pretrained diffusion and flow models, going beyond ODE timestep optimization.

Method: Parameterize stochastic interpolant schedulers using Bézier functions to design optimal sampling trajectory transformations, ensuring boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity.

Result: BézierFlow achieves 2-3x performance improvement in sampling with ≤10 NFEs and requires only 15 minutes of training. It consistently outperforms prior methods across various models.

Conclusion: Using Bézier-based trajectory transformations significantly enhances few-step sampling performance and expands the scope beyond traditional timestep-based optimizations.

Abstract: We introduce BézierFlow, a lightweight training approach for few-step generation with pretrained diffusion and flow models. BézierFlow achieves a 2-3x performance improvement for sampling with $\leq$ 10 NFEs while requiring only 15 minutes of training. Recent lightweight training approaches have shown promise by learning optimal timesteps, but their scope remains restricted to ODE discretizations. To broaden this scope, we propose learning the optimal transformation of the sampling trajectory by parameterizing stochastic interpolant (SI) schedulers. The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as Bézier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to Bézier control points. Across a range of pretrained diffusion and flow models, BézierFlow consistently outperforms prior timestep-learning methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of expanding the search space from discrete timesteps to Bézier-based trajectory transformations.

*Qinglin Jia,Zhaocheng Du,Chuhan Wu,Huifeng Guo,Ruiming Tang,Shuting Shi,Muyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of CVR prediction with diverse customer acquisition goals and incomplete multi-task data in online advertising systems. It proposes a Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML) and demonstrates improved performance through evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advertisers in online advertising systems have diverse customer acquisition goals, with incomplete labels from post-click data. Existing CVR prediction models struggle to handle the resulting incomplete and skewed multi-label data effectively, leading to mismatched distributions between training and deployment.

Method: The authors propose KAML, utilizing an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to manage asymmetric multi-label data, hierarchical knowledge extraction (HKE) to address sample discrepancies, and a ranking loss strategy to make use of unlabeled samples for better predictions.

Result: The proposed KAML framework shows significant improvements over existing MTL baselines. This conclusion is based on comprehensive evaluations using both offline industry data and online A/B tests.

Conclusion: The KAML framework effectively addresses incomplete and skewed multi-label data in CVR prediction, enhancing performance and utility in real-world advertising scenarios.

Abstract: In most real-world online advertising systems, advertisers typically have diverse customer acquisition goals. A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines.

Motivation: To address learning challenges posed by highly disjoint data distributions in cross-silo Federated Learning while preserving user privacy.

Method: ALIGN-FL selectively shares generative components among clients, uses generative models for server training with synthetic samples, and incorporates complementary privacy mechanisms like DP-SGD with adaptive clipping and Lipschitz regularization.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST with cross-domain outliers show data utility preservation in extreme Non-IID conditions while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: ALIGN-FL effectively supports privacy-preserving learning in cross-silo FL scenarios with heterogeneous clients under Non-IID data conditions using generative modeling.

Abstract: We present ALIGN-FL, a novel approach to distributed learning that addresses the challenge of learning from highly disjoint data distributions through selective sharing of generative components. Instead of exchanging full model parameters, our framework enables privacy-preserving learning by transferring only generative capabilities across clients, while the server performs global training using synthetic samples. Through complementary privacy mechanisms: DP-SGD with adaptive clipping and Lipschitz regularized VAE decoders and a stateful architecture supporting heterogeneous clients, we experimentally validate our approach on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets with cross-domain outliers. Our analysis demonstrates that both privacy mechanisms effectively map sensitive outliers to typical data points while maintaining utility in extreme Non-IID scenarios typical of cross-silo collaborations.

Motivation: To develop compact yet highly accurate neural networks capable of solving PDEs with ultra-low latency, addressing real-time computational needs.

Method: Knowledge distillation is applied through Kullback-Leibler divergence adaptation, transferring the teacher model's accuracy to a student model.

Result: The student model achieves remarkable inference speedups (4.8x to 6.9x), preserves original accuracy with only 0.64% mean RMSE increase, demonstrates a regularizing effect, and delivers sub-10 ms inference latency.

Conclusion: KD-PINN successfully combines high accuracy with low latency, paving the way for efficient neural PDE solvers optimized for real-time applications.

Abstract: This work introduces Knowledge-Distilled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (KD-PINN), a framework that transfers the predictive accuracy of a high-capacity teacher model to a compact student through a continuous adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). In all tested cases, the student model preserved the teacher's physical accuracy, with a mean RMSE increase below 0.64%, and achieved inference speedups ranging from 4.8x (Navier-Stokes) to 6.9x (Burgers). The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance. Finally, this study examines how knowledge distillation reduces inference latency in PINNs to contribute to the development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers.

*Si Qi Goh,Yongsen Zheng,Ziyao Liu,Sami Hormi,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FROC, a risk-optimized framework for machine unlearning (MU) in large language models (LLMs), enabling better balance between forgetting data and maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in effectively controlling and evaluating the trade-off between sufficient forgetting and utility loss in LLMs, a crucial issue given the increasing importance of the 'right to be forgotten.'

Method: FROC employs a conformal-style risk-control framework to manage unlearning behavior, introducing a continuous risk model and metrics like Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR) to assess and control forgetting sufficiency and utility loss.

Result: FROC generates interpretable risk landscapes and provides actionable insights for unlearning configurations, demonstrating strong relationships between configurations, semantic shifts, and utility impacts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework redefines MU as a risk-aware, controllable process, making it a practical and effective solution for managing unlearning in LLMs at scale.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) seeks to eliminate the influence of specific training examples from deployed models. As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the "right to be forgotten." To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of maintaining inference accuracy in IoT devices amidst non-stationary environments and limited initial training data, while minimizing energy consumption.

Method: An event-driven communication framework is developed that integrates continual learning to adapt device-edge server collaboration based on wireless link and energy budget.

Result: Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates improvements in inference recall by up to 42.8%, outperforming periodic sampling and non-adaptive continual learning approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows promising advancements in ensuring accurate and energy-efficient operation of lightweight ML models for IoT networks.

Abstract: The use of lightweight machine learning (ML) models in internet of things (IoT) networks enables resource constrained IoT devices to perform on-device inference for several critical applications. However, the inference accuracy deteriorates due to the non-stationarity in the IoT environment and limited initial training data. To counteract this, the deployed models can be updated occasionally with new observed data samples. However, this approach consumes additional energy, which is undesirable for energy constrained IoT devices. This letter introduces an event-driven communication framework that strategically integrates continual learning (CL) in IoT networks for energy-efficient fault detection. Our framework enables the IoT device and the edge server (ES) to collaboratively update the lightweight ML model by adapting to the wireless link conditions for communication and the available energy budget. Evaluation on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can outperform both periodic sampling and non-adaptive CL in terms of inference recall; our proposed approach achieves up to a 42.8% improvement, even under tight energy and bandwidth constraint.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPUL, a novel method for Federated Unlearning to improve privacy and efficiency by addressing current challenges like imbalance and privacy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Federated Unlearning by tackling privacy leakage, computational inefficiency, and imbalances among client computing powers.

Method: DPUL introduces three components: identifying high-weight parameters, employing a variational autoencoder for low-weight parameter reconstruction and elimination, and using projection-based recovery for enhanced model adjustments.

Result: Experimental results deliver a 1%-5% accuracy improvement and up to 12x reduction in time cost compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: DPUL proves to be a highly effective and efficient solution for privacy-preserving Federated Unlearning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FUL) focuses on client data and computing power to offer a privacy-preserving solution. However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost.

Conclusion: The proposed XNNTab architecture successfully bridges the gap between neural network expressiveness and interpretability, enabling its use in tabular data applications.

Abstract: In data-driven applications relying on tabular data, where interpretability is key, machine learning models such as decision trees and linear regression are applied. Although neural networks can provide higher predictive performance, they are not used because of their blackbox nature. In this work, we present XNNTab, a neural architecture that combines the expressiveness of neural networks and interpretability. XNNTab first learns highly non-linear feature representations, which are decomposed into monosemantic features using a sparse autoencoder (SAE). These features are then assigned human-interpretable concepts, making the overall model prediction intrinsically interpretable. XNNTab outperforms interpretable predictive models, and achieves comparable performance to its non-interpretable counterparts.

### [505] [SSAS: Cross-subject EEG-based Emotion Recognition through Source Selection with Adversarial Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13458)
*Yici Liu,Qi Wei Oung,Hoi Leong Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enhance cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition by addressing inter-individual variability and negative transfer issues using a source selection and adversarial strategy framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most cross-subject EEG-based emotion studies fail to account for inter-individual variability and negative transfer during model training, which hampers performance across diverse users.

Method: The method involves two modules: (1) a Source Selection (SS) network leveraging domain labels to magnify inter-domain differences and force the model to learn emotion-related domain-invariant features, and (2) an Adversarial Strategies (AS) network using source selections and pretrained domain discriminators to optimize domain classification through a novel loss function.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance on EEG emotion recognition benchmarks, specifically the SEED and SEED-IV datasets.

Conclusion: The combination of source selection and adversarial strategies effectively addresses limitations in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition, paving the way for more reliable aBCI applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

*Chethana Prasad Kabgere,Shylaja S S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-EMAR, a framework for detecting and fixing data distortions in Federated Learning within IoT systems, ensuring robustness and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue of model weight distortion due to unstable connectivity and interference in resource-constrained IoT networks during Federated Learning requires resolution.

Method: DP-EMAR employs an error model to detect and repair transmission distortions while integrating Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation to maintain privacy.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that DP-EMAR achieves stable convergence and near-baseline performance despite communication corruption while ensuring privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: DP-EMAR enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of privacy-preserving Federated IoT learning systems by effectively addressing transmission distortions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, but model weight distortion remains a major challenge in resource constrained IoT networks. In multi tier Federated IoT (Fed-IoT) systems, unstable connectivity and adversarial interference can silently alter transmitted parameters, degrading convergence. We propose DP-EMAR, a differentially private, error model based autonomous repair framework that detects and reconstructs transmission induced distortions during FL aggregation. DP-EMAR estimates corruption patterns and applies adaptive correction before privacy noise is added, enabling reliable in network repair without violating confidentiality. By integrating Differential Privacy (DP) with Secure Aggregation (SA), the framework distinguishes DP noise from genuine transmission errors. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT sensor and graph datasets show that DP-EMAR preserves convergence stability and maintains near baseline performance under communication corruption while ensuring strict (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantees. The framework enhances robustness, communication efficiency, and trust in privacy preserving Federated IoT learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully connected layers are resource-intensive due to redundant parameterization, and existing compression methods often result in trade-offs or performance loss.

Abstract: Fully connected layers are a primary source of memory and computational overhead in deep neural networks due to their dense, often redundant parameterization. While various compression techniques exist, they frequently introduce complex engineering trade-offs or degrade model performance. We propose the Parametrized Random Projection (PRP) layer, a novel approach that decouples feature mixing from adaptation by utilizing a fixed random matrix modulated by lightweight, learnable element-wise parameters. This architecture drastically reduces the trainable parameter count to a linear scale while retaining reliable accuracy across various benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight, on-device unsupervised method for Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) in dynamic manufacturing scenarios, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, memory efficiency, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic and flexible manufacturing requires efficient and adaptive VAD methods suitable for frequent product changes, constrained edge hardware, and limited training data availability.

Method: The researchers extended the PatchCore model by implementing an on-device continual learning framework using a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection.

Result: The method shows a 12% AUROC improvement, an 80% reduction in memory usage, and faster training compared to batch retraining on an industrial use case.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates effective, resource-efficient, and adaptive VAD capable of handling the dynamic nature of modern manufacturing environments.

Abstract: In modern manufacturing, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for automated inspection and consistent product quality. Yet, increasingly dynamic and flexible production environments introduce key challenges: First, frequent product changes in small-batch and on-demand manufacturing require rapid model updates. Second, legacy edge hardware lacks the resources to train and run large AI models. Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios. The proposed method leverages a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection, enabling rapid, memory-efficient adaptation from limited data while eliminating costly cloud retraining. Evaluations on an industrial use case are conducted using a testbed designed to emulate flexible production with frequent variant changes in a controlled environment. Our method achieves a 12% AUROC improvement over the baseline, an 80% reduction in memory usage, and faster training compared to batch retraining. These results confirm that our method delivers accurate, resource-efficient, and adaptive VAD suitable for dynamic and smart manufacturing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates asynchronous monitoring systems for LLM-based software engineering agents to minimize sabotage risks while avoiding runtime delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to protect sensitive or security-critical codebases from potential sabotage by misaligned LLM-based agents, ensuring safe deployment in real-world software engineering environments.

Method: The authors treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue (monitor development) and red (sabotage creation) team. They test this approach in five diverse software engineering environments and design a monitoring system to assess potential sabotage risk.

Result: The developed ensemble monitor achieves a 6% false negative rate with a 1% false positive rate on a held-out test environment. Risk estimation in deployment includes extrapolation and a sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: Asynchronous monitoring provides a viable method to mitigate risks from misaligned LLM agents, with realistic performance measures and considerations for future refinements. A code repository is provided for public access.

Abstract: LLM-based software engineering agents are increasingly used in real-world development tasks, often with access to sensitive data or security-critical codebases. Such agents could intentionally sabotage these codebases if they were misaligned. We investigate asynchronous monitoring, in which a monitoring system reviews agent actions after the fact. Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

### [510] [Superposition as Lossy Compression: Measure with Sparse Autoencoders and Connect to Adversarial Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13568)
*Leonard Bereska,Zoe Tzifa-Kratira,Reza Samavi,Efstratios Gavves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a metric to measure neural networks' superposition – their ability to encode overlapping features through activation space – using an information-theoretic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how neural networks encode overlapping features, known as superposition, is fundamental for improving interpretability and robustness, especially without good methods to measure it.

Method: The authors employ Shannon entropy applied to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the effective number of features (or simulated 'virtual neurons') and examine interference and compression trade-offs.

Result: The metric effectively quantifies superposition, correlates with ground truth in simulations, detects patterns during tasks like grokking, and shows changes under conditions like dropout and adversarial training.

Conclusion: Defining superposition as lossy compression enables systematic measurement, revealing connections to intrinsic dimensionality, developmental dynamics, and robustness affected by task complexity and capacity.

Abstract: Neural networks achieve remarkable performance through superposition: encoding multiple features as overlapping directions in activation space rather than dedicating individual neurons to each feature. This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many "virtual neurons" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized learning methods struggle to simultaneously ensure rigorous differential privacy, high model utility, and efficient communication, especially in directed graph settings.

Method: The authors propose DP-CSGP, an algorithm combining differential privacy, stochastic gradient push, and compressed communication. It establishes a utility bound for non-convex and smooth functions while ensuring (ε, δ)-DP guarantees for each node.

Result: DP-CSGP achieves a tight utility bound comparable to algorithms with exact communication. Experiments on benchmark tasks show high model accuracy with significantly reduced communication costs under the same privacy budget.

Conclusion: DP-CSGP improves decentralized learning by maintaining model accuracy while significantly reducing communication costs and ensuring privacy through differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Push with Compressed communication (termed DP-CSGP) for decentralized learning over directed graphs. Different from existing works, the proposed algorithm is designed to maintain high model utility while ensuring both rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees and efficient communication. For general non-convex and smooth objective functions, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves a tight utility bound of $\mathcal{O}\left( \sqrt{d\log \left( \frac{1}δ \right)}/(\sqrt{n}Jε) \right)$ ($J$ and $d$ are the number of local samples and the dimension of decision variables, respectively) with $\left(ε, δ\right)$-DP guarantee for each node, matching that of decentralized counterparts with exact communication. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks show that, under the same privacy budget, DP-CSGP achieves comparable model accuracy with significantly lower communication cost than existing decentralized counterparts with exact communication.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'Diffusion Preview,' leveraging a new method, ConsistencySolver, to accelerate image diffusion model inference by improving preview quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow inference process of image diffusion models affects user interaction, necessitating faster methods that maintain output quality and consistency.

Method: Introduced ConsistencySolver, a high-order lightweight solver derived from general linear multistep methods, optimized using Reinforcement Learning, for fast previews and better consistency.

Result: ConsistencySolver improves preview quality and reduces steps by 47%, achieving FID scores on par with state-of-the-art alternatives and reducing user interaction times by 50%.

Conclusion: Diffusion Preview with ConsistencySolver enables efficient preview-and-refine workflows, enhancing user interaction efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: The slow inference process of image diffusion models significantly degrades interactive user experiences. To address this, we introduce Diffusion Preview, a novel paradigm employing rapid, low-step sampling to generate preliminary outputs for user evaluation, deferring full-step refinement until the preview is deemed satisfactory. Existing acceleration methods, including training-free solvers and post-training distillation, struggle to deliver high-quality previews or ensure consistency between previews and final outputs. We propose ConsistencySolver derived from general linear multistep methods, a lightweight, trainable high-order solver optimized via Reinforcement Learning, that enhances preview quality and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ConsistencySolver significantly improves generation quality and consistency in low-step scenarios, making it ideal for efficient preview-and-refine workflows. Notably, it achieves FID scores on-par with Multistep DPM-Solver using 47% fewer steps, while outperforming distillation baselines. Furthermore, user studies indicate our approach reduces overall user interaction time by nearly 50% while maintaining generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/consolver.

*Robert Reed,Morteza Lahijanian,Luca Laurenti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a formal dimensionality reduction method combining convex autoencoders and kernel-based learning to enable finite abstraction for high-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability challenges in finite abstraction methods for high-dimensional systems caused by state-space discretization.

Method: Uses convex autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, learns dynamics in the latent space via a kernel-based method, and constructs finite abstractions while preserving system behaviors.

Result: The proposed method ensures that verification results in the latent space are valid for the original system and demonstrates scalability improvements on systems up to 26 dimensions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively scales finite abstraction methods for high-dimensional systems while maintaining verification rigor.

Abstract: Finite Abstraction methods provide a powerful formal framework for proving that systems satisfy their specifications. However, these techniques face scalability challenges for high-dimensional systems, as they rely on state-space discretization which grows exponentially with dimension. Learning-based approaches to dimensionality reduction, utilizing neural networks and autoencoders, have shown great potential to alleviate this problem. However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple systems, including a 26D system controlled by a neural network, showing significant scalability improvements without loss of rigor.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of computational inefficiency and limited ability to capture global graph properties in existing graph neural networks.

Method: LightTopoGAT enhances graph representation by augmenting node features with topological properties like node degree and local clustering coefficient, using streamlined attention mechanisms.

Result: LightTopoGAT outperformed baselines such as GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT on benchmarks like MUTAG (6.6% improvement in accuracy) and PROTEINS (2.2% improvement).

Conclusion: The inclusion of topological features offers a simple yet effective means to improve graph neural network performance without added complexity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated significant success in graph classification tasks, yet they often require substantial computational resources and struggle to capture global graph properties effectively. We introduce LightTopoGAT, a lightweight graph attention network that enhances node features through topological augmentation by incorporating node degree and local clustering coefficient to improve graph representation learning. The proposed approach maintains parameter efficiency through streamlined attention mechanisms while integrating structural information that is typically overlooked by local message passing schemes. Through comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, MUTAG, ENZYMES, and PROTEINS, we show that LightTopoGAT achieves superior performance compared to established baselines including GCN, GraphSAGE, and standard GAT, with a 6.6 percent improvement in accuracy on MUTAG and a 2.2 percent improvement on PROTEINS. Ablation studies further confirm that these performance gains arise directly from the inclusion of topological features, demonstrating a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing graph neural network performance without increasing architectural complexity.

*Guransh Singh,Md Shah Fahad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StutterFuse, a new Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC), improves multi-label stuttering detection by leveraging external clinical examples and solving precision-related issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric models fail to handle overlapping disfluencies in stuttering due to a lack of specific combinations in training data. Pathological speech processing has not explored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods.

Method: The paper introduces StutterFuse, which uses a Conformer encoder conditioned on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples. It incorporates SetCon for optimizing multi-label set similarity and a Gated Mixture-of-Experts strategy for balancing acoustic evidence and retrieved context.

Result: StutterFuse achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.65 on the SEP-28k dataset, surpassing baseline models and showing strong zero-shot cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: StutterFuse bridges the gap in pathological speech processing by effectively classifying stuttering patterns through external knowledge, demonstrating improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: Stuttering detection breaks down when disfluencies overlap. Existing parametric models struggle to distinguish complex, simultaneous disfluencies (e.g., a 'block' with a 'prolongation') due to the scarcity of these specific combinations in training data. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized NLP by grounding models in external knowledge, this paradigm remains unexplored in pathological speech processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce StutterFuse, the first Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC) for multi-label stuttering detection. By conditioning a Conformer encoder on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples, we allow the model to classify by reference rather than memorization. We further identify and solve "Modality Collapse", an "Echo Chamber" effect where naive retrieval boosts recall but degrades precision. We mitigate this using: (1) SetCon, a Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning objective that optimizes for multi-label set similarity, and (2) a Gated Mixture-of-Experts fusion strategy that dynamically arbitrates between acoustic evidence and retrieved context. On the SEP-28k dataset, StutterFuse achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.65, outperforming strong baselines and demonstrating remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for diagnosing mango leaf diseases under various artificial image corruptions and suggests the importance of lightweight models in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of studies on robustness assessment of AI models diagnosing diseases in mango leaves and ensure reliable performance under real-world challenges.

Method: A methodology was proposed to test CNNs with a new dataset (MangoLeafDB-C), containing 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. Five architectures, including LCNN, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, and Xception, were benchmarked using various metrics (F1 score, CE, relative mCE).

Result: LCNN performed better under real-world corruption scenarios like Defocus Blur and Motion Blur, achieving the lowest relative mCE. Complex models (e.g., ResNet-101) showed significant robustness issues despite their accuracy under ideal conditions.

Conclusion: Lightweight and specialized models, like LCNN, are more suitable for real-world agricultural applications, especially in edge devices, highlighting the necessity of robustness assessments in AI model development for agriculture.

Abstract: The validation and verification of artificial intelligence (AI) models through robustness assessment are essential to guarantee the reliable performance of intelligent systems facing real-world challenges, such as image corruptions including noise, blurring, and weather variations. Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical. The study highlights the need to incorporate robustness assessments in the development of intelligent systems for agriculture, particularly in regions with technological limitations.

Motivation: Bridging the gap between computational synthesis planning and practical lab execution is crucial for enabling automation in drug discovery and synthesis workflows.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 905,990 chemical reactions from patent literature, implemented a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning framework with explicit chain-of-thought data, fine-tuned the model, and utilized Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards for better performance.

Result: QFANG surpasses state-of-the-art models in generating accurate synthesis procedures, generalizes to out-of-domain reactions, and adapts to lab constraints, verified by chemical-aware evaluation.

Conclusion: QFANG represents a significant advancement in integrating computational synthesis planning with automated laboratory execution, paving the way for efficient, precise, and practical workflows.

Abstract: Solving computer-aided synthesis planning is essential for enabling fully automated, robot-assisted synthesis workflows and improving the efficiency of drug discovery. A key challenge, however, is bridging the gap between computational route design and practical laboratory execution, particularly the accurate prediction of viable experimental procedures for each synthesis step. In this work, we present QFANG, a scientific reasoning language model capable of generating precise, structured experimental procedures directly from reaction equations, with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. To develop QFANG, we curated a high-quality dataset comprising 905,990 chemical reactions paired with structured action sequences, extracted and processed from patent literature using large language models. We introduce a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning (CGR) framework that produces chain-of-thought data grounded in chemical knowledge at scale. The model subsequently undergoes supervised fine-tuning to elicit complex chemistry reasoning. Finally, we apply Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further enhance procedural accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that QFANG outperforms advanced general-purpose reasoning models and nearest-neighbor retrieval baselines, measured by traditional NLP similarity metrics and a chemically aware evaluator using an LLM-as-a-judge. Moreover, QFANG generalizes to certain out-of-domain reaction classes and adapts to variations in laboratory conditions and user-specific constraints. We believe that QFANG's ability to generate high-quality synthesis procedures represents an important step toward bridging the gap between computational synthesis planning and fully automated laboratory synthesis.

*Kunhee Kim,NaHyeon Park,Kibeom Hong,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), a method to improve on traditional Textual Inversion (TI) for text-to-image personalization by focusing on embedding direction rather than inflated norm magnitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the failures of Textual Inversion (TI) on complex prompts due to embedding norm inflation, which harms prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers.

Method: The authors propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the magnitude of embeddings to in-distribution scales and optimizes their direction using Riemannian SGD and a von Mises-Fisher prior for direction learning.

Result: DTI significantly improves text fidelity over TI and its variants while preserving subject similarity. It also facilitates smooth and semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts, a feature absent in standard TI.

Conclusion: Directional optimization via DTI is a robust, scalable method for achieving prompt-faithful personalization in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Textual Inversion (TI) is an efficient approach to text-to-image personalization but often fails on complex prompts. We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI. Our findings suggest that direction-only optimization is a robust and scalable path for prompt-faithful personalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to translate artificial neural networks (ANNs) into spiking neural networks (SNNs), potentially improving efficiency by a thousandfold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models based on ANNs are significantly less energy-efficient compared to the human brain, necessitating a more efficient alternative inspired by biological systems.

Method: The paper proposes reinterpreting AI models using spiking networks and polychronization, comparing brain processes to look-up table implementations.

Result: The framework shows promise in converting AI models into architectures that achieve substantial efficiency gains, with code provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Adopting spiking neural networks offers an innovative way to replicate AI tasks while drastically reducing energy consumption, moving closer to the brain's efficiency.

Abstract: Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator crunches numbers more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and require GPUs for the multiplication of huge matrices. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) of the brain have no matrix multiplication and much smaller energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a framework for thinking about popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables.

*Mitchell Marfinetz*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a genetic algorithm to discover optimization algorithms for deep learning, resulting in a new optimizer outperforming Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deep learning optimizer performance by automating the discovery of optimization algorithms using genetic algorithm techniques.

Method: The approach uses genetic algorithms to encode and evolve combinations of gradient update terms, hyperparameters, and scheduling. Evaluations are conducted over 50 generations and 50 individuals across various computer vision tasks.

Result: The evolved optimizer outperformed Adam by 2.6% in aggregate fitness and achieved a 7.7% improvement on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Conclusion: Evolutionary methods can successfully discover high-performing optimization algorithms, challenging hand-crafted optimizer designs and providing new insights into optimizer construction.

Abstract: We present a genetic algorithm framework for automatically discovering deep learning optimization algorithms. Our approach encodes optimizers as genomes that specify combinations of primitive update terms (gradient, momentum, RMS normalization, Adam-style adaptive terms, and sign-based updates) along with hyperparameters and scheduling options. Through evolutionary search over 50 generations with a population of 50 individuals, evaluated across multiple vision tasks, we discover an evolved optimizer that outperforms Adam by 2.6% in aggregate fitness and achieves a 7.7% relative improvement on CIFAR-10. The evolved optimizer combines sign-based gradient terms with adaptive moment estimation, uses lower momentum coefficients than Adam ($β_1$=0.86, $β_2$=0.94), and notably disables bias correction while enabling learning rate warmup and cosine decay. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary search can discover competitive optimization algorithms and reveal design principles that differ from hand-crafted optimizers.

### [521] [Self-Motivated Growing Neural Network for Adaptive Architecture via Local Structural Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12713)
*Yiyang Jia,Chengxu Zhou*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Self-Motivated Growing Neural Network (SMGrNN), a model featuring an evolving network topology for better performance in learning control policies, evaluated to deliver better or comparable performance to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep reinforcement learning controllers are limited by fixed network architectures and reliance on global error signals, necessitating a novel approach for adaptive topologies.

Method: The SMGrNN introduces a Structural Plasticity Module (SPM) that uses local neuron activations and weight updates to trigger neuron addition or removal dynamically, paired with standard gradient optimization.

Result: SMGrNN delivers similar or higher returns compared to standard networks, reduces variance, adjusts network size for tasks, and demonstrates role of topology in improved stability through ablation studies.

Conclusion: SMGrNN effectively leverages structural plasticity for adaptive learning, showcasing potential for integration with advanced plasticity modules in both artificial and spiking neural contexts.

Abstract: Control policies in deep reinforcement learning are often implemented with fixed-capacity multilayer perceptrons trained by backpropagation, which lack structural plasticity and depend on global error signals. This paper introduces the Self-Motivated Growing Neural Network (SMGrNN), a controller whose topology evolves online through a local Structural Plasticity Module (SPM). The SPM monitors neuron activations and edge-wise weight update statistics over short temporal windows and uses these signals to trigger neuron insertion and pruning, while synaptic weights are updated by a standard gradient-based optimizer. This allows network capacity to be regulated during learning without manual architectural tuning.
  SMGrNN is evaluated on control benchmarks via policy distillation. Compared with multilayer perceptron baselines, it achieves similar or higher returns, lower variance, and task-appropriate network sizes. Ablation studies with growth disabled and growth-only variants isolate the role of structural plasticity, showing that adaptive topology improves reward stability. The local and modular design of SPM enables future integration of a Hebbian plasticity module and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, so that SMGrNN can support both artificial and spiking neural implementations driven by local rules.

### [522] [OPAL: Operator-Programmed Algorithms for Landscape-Aware Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12809)
*Junbo Jacob Lian,Mingyang Yu,Kaichen Ouyang,Shengwei Fu,Rui Zhong,Yujun Zhang,Jun Zhang,Huiling Chen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: OPAL is introduced as a new black-box optimization framework that uses landscape-aware, per-instance design for operator programming to achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of performance dependency in black-box optimization algorithms by creating a framework that adapts per problem instance rather than relying on fixed, metaphor-based algorithms.

Method: OPAL uses differential evolution to sample problem landscapes, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph from this data, encodes the graph into representations with a graph neural network, and employs meta-learned schedules for operator selection.

Result: OPAL is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art differential evolution variants and outperforms simpler baselines on the CEC 2017 benchmark, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Operator-programmed, landscape-aware approaches like OPAL present a practical path forward for improving black-box optimization performance without relying on ad hoc algorithm designs.

Abstract: Black-box optimization often relies on evolutionary and swarm algorithms whose performance is highly problem dependent. We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.

### [523] [Reproducing and Dissecting Denoising Language Models for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13576)
*Dorian Koch,Albert Zeyer,Nick Rossenbach,Ralf Schlüter,Hermann Ney*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A large-scale empirical study on denoising language models (DLMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), introducing a reproducible pipeline to analyze design factors. Concludes that DLMs outperform traditional language models given sufficient computational resources and presents DLM-sum as a better decoding method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional language models in ASR by using denoising language models capable of utilizing bidirectional context and adapting to ASR-specific error patterns.

Method: Developed and released a reproducible pipeline to test various DLM configurations across data augmentation methods, text-to-speech systems, and decoding strategies. Also introduced a new decoding method (DLM-sum).

Result: DLMs show superior performance over traditional LMs in a shared vocabulary setting above a certain compute threshold but require longer training to scale effectively. Performance gains depend on conditioning on richer hypothesis information and vocabulary choices.

Conclusion: DLMs present significant potential in ASR, especially with adequate computational resources. The novel DLM-sum decoding method enhances their effectiveness. Findings and pipeline aim to drive future research in this area.

Abstract: Denoising language models (DLMs) have been proposed as a powerful alternative to traditional language models (LMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), motivated by their ability to use bidirectional context and adapt to a specific ASR model's error patterns. However, the complexity of the DLM training pipeline has hindered wider investigation. This paper presents the first independent, large-scale empirical study of DLMs. We build and release a complete, reproducible pipeline to systematically investigate the impact of key design choices. We evaluate dozens of configurations across multiple axes, including various data augmentation techniques (e.g., SpecAugment, dropout, mixup), different text-to-speech systems, and multiple decoding strategies. Our comparative analysis in a common subword vocabulary setting demonstrates that DLMs outperform traditional LMs, but only after a distinct compute tipping point. While LMs are more efficient at lower budgets, DLMs scale better with longer training, mirroring behaviors observed in diffusion language models. However, we observe smaller improvements than those reported in prior character-based work, which indicates that the DLM's performance is conditional on factors such as the vocabulary. Our analysis reveals that a key factor for improving performance is to condition the DLM on richer information from the ASR's hypothesis space, rather than just a single best guess. To this end, we introduce DLM-sum, a novel method for decoding from multiple ASR hypotheses, which consistently outperforms the previously proposed DSR decoding method. We believe our findings and public pipeline provide a crucial foundation for the community to better understand, improve, and build upon this promising class of models.

*Siyuan Shen,Mikhail Khalilov,Lukas Gianinazzi,Timo Schneider,Marcin Chrapek,Jai Dayal,Manisha Gajbe,Robert Wisniewski,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDAN, a tool to analyze memory latency sensitivity using execution DAGs, addressing the inefficiencies of custom hardware and simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies caused by increased memory access latency in resource disaggregation and the limitations of existing latency sensitivity measurement tools.

Method: EDAN generates execution DAGs from runtime instruction traces to estimate memory latency sensitivity and investigate hardware impacts.

Result: EDAN reveals memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity in benchmarks like PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH.

Conclusion: EDAN provides insights into memory-level parallelism and theoretical performance bounds, aiding optimization in HPC applications.

Abstract: Resource disaggregation is a promising technique for improving the efficiency of large-scale computing systems. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications. We apply EDAN to applications and benchmarks such as PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH to unveil the characteristics of their intrinsic memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity.

*Zheng Li,Peng Zhang,Shixiao Liang,Hang Zhou,Chengyuan Ma,Handong Yao,Qianwen Li,Xiaopeng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC) system by collecting vehicle data and analyzing its interaction with traffic control devices. It develops behavioral models and provides empirical insights on ADAS performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of empirical studies on the interaction between ADAS systems and traffic control devices, which is critical for understanding and improving traffic operations.

Method: Experiments were conducted in a variety of conditions to collect synchronized vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. Behavioral modes were analyzed, and a taxonomy was developed. The Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) was calibrated to characterize these behaviors.

Result: The study identified behavioral patterns such as stopping and accelerating, with key insights on car-following behavior thresholds (~90m) and smoother dynamics when following in intersections.

Conclusion: The findings establish a strong foundation for future advancements in ADAS design, simulation, and safety evaluations. The dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Understanding how Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) interact with Traffic Control Devices (TCDs) is critical for assessing their influence on traffic operations, yet this interaction has received little focused empirical study. This paper presents a field dataset and behavioral analysis of Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC), a mature ADAS that perceives traffic lights and stop signs. We design and execute experiments across varied speed limits and TCD types, collecting synchronized high-resolution vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. From these data, we develop a taxonomy of TLSSC-TCD interaction behaviors (i.e., stopping, accelerating, and car following) and calibrate the Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) to quantitatively characterize each behavior mode. A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative. Intersection car-following behavior exhibits smoother dynamics and tighter headways compared to standard car-following behaviors. The established dataset, behavior definitions, and model characterizations together provide a foundation for future simulation, safety evaluation, and design of ADAS-TCD interaction logic. Our dataset is available at GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WAM-Diff, a novel framework using masked diffusion for autonomous driving, refining ego-trajectories through discrete sequences. It outperforms existing models on NAVSIM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation in autonomous driving, addressing the limitations of autoregressive and traditional diffusion-based methods.

Method: The framework employs masked diffusion with non-causal decoding orders, sparse MoE architecture for scalability, and reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to improve trajectory generation.

Result: WAM-Diff achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating its efficacy and improvement over other policies.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion represents a viable and effective alternative for trajectory generation in autonomous driving, supporting better decoding strategies and providing promising outcomes in simulation environments.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

Method: The researchers used microphones on a robot's body to record sound generated by different touch interactions. They trained a convolutional neural network on 336 pre-processed samples to classify touch types.

Result: The neural network achieved high accuracy in classifying various touch types (e.g., tapping, rubbing) based on sound frequency distinctions.

Conclusion: Sound-based tactile detection using microphones is a viable method for identifying touch types, offering an effective alternative to force or torque sensor-based approaches.

Abstract: This study explores the use of microphones placed on a robot's body to detect tactile interactions via sounds produced when the hard shell of the robot is touched. This approach is proposed as an alternative to traditional methods using joint torque sensors or 6-axis force/torque sensors. Two Adafruit I2S MEMS microphones integrated with a Raspberry Pi 4 were positioned on the torso of a Pollen Robotics Reachy robot to capture audio signals from various touch types on the robot arms (tapping, knocking, rubbing, stroking, scratching, and pressing). A convolutional neural network was trained for touch classification on a dataset of 336 pre-processed samples (48 samples per touch type).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for intelligent navigation in unstructured terrains, focusing on energy-efficient path planning using learned terrain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of autonomous navigation in unstructured environments, balancing efficiency and safety when planning paths.

Method: The framework involves using LiDAR-based localization (FAST-LIO) to generate elevation maps, estimating traversability scores through a CNN model, and employing a custom traversability-aware A* planner to generate optimal paths.

Result: Experimental results showed successful navigation avoiding difficult terrain while reducing terrain cost, even with slightly longer paths.

Conclusion: The work provides a solid foundation for terrain-aware navigation in robotic platforms, combining localization, mapping, and path-planning techniques.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments requires robots to assess terrain difficulty in real-time and plan paths that balance efficiency with safety. This thesis presents a traversability-aware navigation framework for the M4 robot platform that uses learned terrain analysis to generate energy-efficient paths avoiding difficult terrain.Our approach uses FAST-LIO for real-time localization, generating 2.5D elevation maps from LiDAR point clouds. A CNN-based model processes these elevation maps to estimate traversability scores, which are converted into navigation costs for path planning. A custom A* planner incorporates these costs alongside geometric distance and energy consumption to find paths that trade modest distance increases for substantial terrain quality improvements. Before system development, a platform-agnostic study compared LiDAR-based and camera-based SLAM using OptiTrack ground truth. Point cloud comparison through ICP alignment and cloud-to-mesh distance analysis demonstrated that LiDAR-based mapping achieves centimeter-level precision essential for elevation mapping, while camera-based approaches exhibited significantly higher geometric error. These findings directly resulted in the selection of LiDAR as the primary sensor to generate elevation maps. The complete pipeline integrates FAST-LIO localization, GPU-accelerated elevation mapping, CNN-based traversability estimation, and Nav2 navigation with a custom traversability-aware planner. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids low traversability regions and accepts a few longer paths to achieve a reduction in terrain cost. This work establishes a foundation for intelligent terrain-aware navigation applicable to multi-modal robotic platforms.

Motivation: To overcome challenges in autonomous navigation for snake robots in extreme terrains without external tracking infrastructure.

Method: The approach combines onboard visual-inertial SLAM, reduced-order state estimation, and closed-loop trajectory tracking, with depth camera-based real-time localization and reduced-order controllers for gait modulation.

Result: The physical experiments validate the pipeline, demonstrating robust waypoint tracking and improved autonomy in snake robot locomotion.

Conclusion: The research paves the way for autonomous navigation in snake robots, enhancing their capability for planetary exploration and dynamic terrain navigation.

Abstract: Snake robots offer exceptional mobility across extreme terrain inaccessible to conventional rovers, yet their highly articulated bodies present fundamental challenges for autonomous navigation in environments lacking external tracking infrastructure. This thesis develops a complete autonomy pipeline for COBRA, an 11 degree-of-freedom modular snake robot designed for planetary exploration. While the robot's biologically inspired serpentine gaits achieve impressive mobility, prior work has relied entirely on open-loop teleoperation. This approach integrates onboard visual-inertial SLAM, reduced-order state estimation, and closed-loop trajectory tracking to enable autonomous waypoint navigation. A depth camera paired with edge computing performs real-time localization during dynamic locomotion, validated against motion-capture ground truth to characterize drift behavior and failure modes unique to snake robot platforms. A reduced-order framework estimates Center-of-Mass pose, driving a closed-loop controller that modulates CPG gait parameters through distance-dependent yaw error blending. Physical experiments validate the complete system, demonstrating accurate multi-waypoint tracking and establishing foundations for autonomous snake robot navigation.

Result: AEGIS showed 59.16% improvement in obstacle avoidance and a 17.25% increase in success rate of task execution within a safety-critical benchmark, SafeLIBERO.

Conclusion: AEGIS effectively enhances the safety and task success rate for robotic manipulation while retaining instruction-following capabilities, contributing to real-world applicability. All resources are publicly accessible for continued research.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generalizing across diverse robotic manipulation tasks. However, deploying these models in unstructured environments remains challenging due to the critical need for simultaneous task compliance and safety assurance, particularly in preventing potential collisions during physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a Vision-Language-Safe Action (VLSA) architecture, named AEGIS, which contains a plug-and-play safety constraint (SC) layer formulated via control barrier functions. AEGIS integrates directly with existing VLA models to improve safety with theoretical guarantees, while maintaining their original instruction-following performance. To evaluate the efficacy of our architecture, we construct a comprehensive safety-critical benchmark SafeLIBERO, spanning distinct manipulation scenarios characterized by varying degrees of spatial complexity and obstacle intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, AEGIS achieves a 59.16% improvement in obstacle avoidance rate while substantially increasing the task execution success rate by 17.25%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to identify hybrid robot dynamics using a combination of analytical models and learned residual torques, achieving superior accuracy and generalization compared to black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop interpretable and accurate models for robot dynamics by combining analytical rigid-body dynamics with learned components, addressing overfitting and transparency issues in black-box models.

Method: The authors propose combining symbolic regression and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to extract compact closed-form expressions for residual dynamics from joint-space data.

Result: Simulation data shows that the proposed models outperform neural networks in accuracy and generalization for torque prediction. On real robot data, symbolic regression generalizes better than SINDy and neural networks, providing new insights into dynamics.

Conclusion: The study confirms that interpretable residual dynamics models are effective alternatives to black-box models, offering accuracy, generalization, and physically meaningful insights for robot torque prediction.

Abstract: We study data-driven identification of interpretable hybrid robot dynamics, where an analytical rigid-body dynamics model is complemented by a learned residual torque term. Using symbolic regression and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), we recover compact closed-form expressions for this residual from joint-space data. In simulation on a 7-DoF Franka arm with known dynamics, these interpretable models accurately recover inertial, Coriolis, gravity, and viscous effects with very small relative error and outperform neural-network baselines in both accuracy and generalization. On real data from a 7-DoF WAM arm, symbolic-regression residuals generalize substantially better than SINDy and neural networks, which tend to overfit, and suggest candidate new closed-form formulations that extend the nominal dynamics model for this robot. Overall, the results indicate that interpretable residual dynamics models provide compact, accurate, and physically meaningful alternatives to black-box function approximators for torque prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Aion, a framework integrating temporal dynamics into 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) to improve navigation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of semantic and temporal representations in navigation, as existing approaches either lack comprehensive dynamic encoding or semantic awareness.

Method: Aion embeds temporal flow dynamics within a hierarchical 3DSG using a graph-based sparse MoD representation, linking motion patterns to navigational nodes.

Result: The proposed method allows interpretable and scalable predictions, enhancing planning and interaction in complex and dynamic settings.

Conclusion: Aion effectively integrates temporal and semantic aspects into 3DSGs, improving navigational efficiency in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments requires spatial representations that capture both semantic structure and temporal evolution. 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) provide hierarchical multi-resolution abstractions that encode geometry and semantics, but existing extensions toward dynamics largely focus on individual objects or agents. In parallel, Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) model typical motion patterns and temporal regularities, yet are usually tied to grid-based discretizations that lack semantic awareness and do not scale well to large environments. In this paper we introduce Aion, a framework that embeds temporal flow dynamics directly within a hierarchical 3DSG, effectively incorporating the temporal dimension. Aion employs a graph-based sparse MoD representation to capture motion flows over arbitrary time intervals and attaches them to navigational nodes in the scene graph, yielding more interpretable and scalable predictions that improve planning and interaction in complex dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation in contact-rich environments faces challenges like uncertainty, complex dynamics, and risks of damage, necessitating safe, learning-based methods for broader real-world deployment.

Method: The paper categorizes existing methods into safe exploration and safe execution. Techniques reviewed include constrained reinforcement learning, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and interactions with vision-language models.

Result: It identifies safety opportunities enabled by unifying perception, language, and control while also discussing amplified risks and challenges from new robotic foundation models.

Conclusion: Safe learning principles combined with robotic foundation models present promising opportunities for deploying reliable robots in contact-rich tasks but require addressing significant challenges and limitations.

Abstract: Contact-rich tasks pose significant challenges for robotic systems due to inherent uncertainty, complex dynamics, and the high risk of damage during interaction. Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation,enabling robots to execute natural language commands through end-to-end learning from visual observations.However, deploying large-scale VLA models on affordable robotic platforms remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for efficient adaptation to new robot embodiments. This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapting VLA models to low-cost robotic manipulation systems.We propose a resource-efficient fine-tuning strategy using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and quantization techniques that enable multi-billion parameter VLA models ( 3.1B parameters) to run on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLA models to new robot embodiments with limited demonstration data, focusing on the trade-offs between frozen and unfrozen vision encoders. Through real-world deployment on the SO101 robotic arm for a button-pressing manipulation task, we demonstrate that our approach achieves effective manipulation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide detailed analysis of deployment challenges, failure modes, and the relationship between training data quantity and real-world performance,trained on 200 demonstration episodes. Our results show that with proper fine-tuning methodology, VLA models can be successfully deployed on affordable robotic platforms,making advanced manipulation capabilities accessible beyond expensive research robots.

### [536] [A Review of Learning-Based Motion Planning: Toward a Data-Driven Optimal Control Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11944)
*Jia Hu,Yang Chang,Haoran Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge in autonomous driving motion planning between transparent pipeline methods and adaptive black-box models. It proposes a data-driven optimal control framework integrating classical control and machine learning for enhanced real-world autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to resolve the trade-off between brittle, transparent pipeline methods and adaptive, opaque learning-based systems in autonomous driving motion planning.

Method: The authors conduct a review of learning-based motion planning methods and propose a unifying data-driven optimal control framework leveraging real-world data to refine system dynamics, safety constraints, and cost functions.

Result: The proposed framework aims to achieve human-centric customization, platform-adaptive dynamics, and system self-optimization, addressing fundamental limitations in current methods.

Conclusion: The study outlines future research directions to develop safer, interpretable, and human-like intelligent transportation systems using the proposed paradigm.

Abstract: Motion planning for high-level autonomous driving is constrained by a fundamental trade-off between the transparent, yet brittle, nature of pipeline methods and the adaptive, yet opaque, "black-box" characteristics of modern learning-based systems. This paper critically synthesizes the evolution of the field -- from pipeline methods through imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI -- to demonstrate how this persistent dilemma has hindered the development of truly trustworthy systems. To resolve this impasse, we conduct a comprehensive review of learning-based motion planning methods. Based on this review, we outline a data-driven optimal control paradigm as a unifying framework that synergistically integrates the verifiable structure of classical control with the adaptive capacity of machine learning, leveraging real-world data to continuously refine key components such as system dynamics, cost functions, and safety constraints. We explore this framework's potential to enable three critical next-generation capabilities: "Human-Centric" customization, "Platform-Adaptive" dynamics adaptation, and "System Self-Optimization" via self-tuning. We conclude by proposing future research directions based on this paradigm, aimed at developing intelligent transportation systems that are simultaneously safe, interpretable, and capable of human-like autonomy.

*Xincheng Cao,Haochong Chen,Bilin Aksun-Guvenc,Levent Guvenc*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modified Hybrid-A* algorithm for parking vehicles in tight spaces, ensuring feasible and collision-free paths through a kinematic single-track model and occupancy map.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parking vehicles in confined spaces poses challenges due to limited collision-free paths, necessitating advanced path-planning solutions.

Method: The authors modify the Hybrid-A* path-planning algorithm by integrating a kinematic single-track model for low-speed vehicle motion and using occupancy maps to avoid collisions with static obstacles.

Result: Simulations and animations validate the algorithm's effectiveness, demonstrating consistent generation of kinematically feasible and collision-free trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy successfully merges feasibility and obstacle avoidance, providing efficient solutions for challenging parking scenarios.

Abstract: Parking a vehicle in tight spaces is a challenging task to perform due to the scarcity of feasible paths that are also collision-free. This paper presents a strategy to tackle this kind of maneuver with a modified Hybrid-A* path-planning algorithm that combines the feasibility guarantee inherent in the standard Hybrid A* algorithm with the addition of static obstacle collision avoidance. A kinematic single-track model is derived to describe the low-speed motion of the vehicle, which is subsequently used as the motion model in the Hybrid A* path-planning algorithm to generate feasible motion primitive branches. The model states are also used to reconstruct the vehicle centerline, which, in conjunction with an inflated binary occupancy map, facilitates static obstacle collision avoidance functions. Simulation study and animation are set up to test the efficacy of the approach, and the proposed algorithm proves to consistently provide kinematically feasible trajectories that are also collision-free.

### [538] [A Stochastic Approach to Terrain Maps for Safe Lunar Landing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12058)
*Anja Sheppard,Chris Reale,Katherine A. Skinner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method using Gaussian processes to generate accurate lunar terrain uncertainty maps for safe landing in risky regions like the South Pole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relying on traditional vision-based and LiDAR methods for hazard detection on the lunar South Pole is unreliable due to the environment's unique challenges. Accurate terrain uncertainty mapping is essential for safe landing.

Method: The study utilizes LRO data and introduces a two-stage Gaussian Process (GP) model. The secondary GP learns noise characteristics from confidence data to improve heteroscedastic modeling, while the primary GP maps terrain using these noise parameters. Scalable training is achieved through stochastic variational GPs.

Result: The proposed method produces detailed terrain uncertainty maps that better account for sensor noise, aiding in safer lunar landing site selection.

Conclusion: Using this advanced GP-based approach enhances hazard detection and safe landing site identification by leveraging improved uncertainty estimations for lunar terrain.

Abstract: Safely landing on the lunar surface is a challenging task, especially in the heavily-shadowed South Pole region where traditional vision-based hazard detection methods are not reliable. The potential existence of valuable resources at the lunar South Pole has made landing in that region a high priority for many space agencies and commercial companies. However, relying on a LiDAR for hazard detection during descent is risky, as this technology is fairly untested in the lunar environment.
  There exists a rich log of lunar surface data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which could be used to create informative prior maps of the surface before descent. In this work, we propose a method for generating stochastic elevation maps from LRO data using Gaussian processes (GPs), which are a powerful Bayesian framework for non-parametric modeling that produce accompanying uncertainty estimates. In high-risk environments such as autonomous spaceflight, interpretable estimates of terrain uncertainty are critical. However, no previous approaches to stochastic elevation mapping have taken LRO Digital Elevation Model (DEM) confidence maps into account, despite this data containing key information about the quality of the DEM in different areas.
  To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage GP model in which a secondary GP learns spatially varying noise characteristics from DEM confidence data. This heteroscedastic information is then used to inform the noise parameters for the primary GP, which models the lunar terrain. Additionally, we use stochastic variational GPs to enable scalable training. By leveraging GPs, we are able to more accurately model the impact of heteroscedastic sensor noise on the resulting elevation map. As a result, our method produces more informative terrain uncertainty, which can be used for downstream tasks such as hazard detection and safe landing site selection.

*Min-Won Seo,Aamodh Suresh,Carlos Nieto-Granda,Solmaz S. Kia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces B-ActiveSEAL, a framework for scalable robot exploration, balancing map and localization uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational difficulty in managing interdependent uncertainties during long-term robotic operations in large-scale environments.

Method: Proposes an active exploration framework (B-ActiveSEAL) using behavioral entropy and uncertainty-aware entropy formulations for decision-making.

Result: The framework is validated theoretically and experimentally, showing improved exploration-exploitation trade-offs and adaptive behaviors compared to baselines.

Conclusion: B-ActiveSEAL provides a novel approach to handle coupled uncertainties, establishing advantages in adaptive exploration for diverse, real-world environments.

Abstract: Active robot exploration requires decision-making processes that integrate localization and mapping under tightly coupled uncertainty. However, managing these interdependent uncertainties over long-term operations in large-scale environments rapidly becomes computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we propose B-ActiveSEAL, a scalable information-theoretic active exploration framework that explicitly accounts for coupled uncertainties-from perception through mapping-into the decision-making process. Our framework (i) adaptively balances map uncertainty (exploration) and localization uncertainty (exploitation), (ii) accommodates a broad class of generalized entropy measures, enabling flexible and uncertainty-aware active exploration, and (iii) establishes Behavioral entropy (BE) as an effective information measure for active exploration by enabling intuitive and adaptive decision-making under coupled uncertainties. We establish a theoretical foundation for propagating coupled uncertainties and integrating them into general entropy formulations, enabling uncertainty-aware active exploration under tightly coupled localization-mapping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on open-source maps and ROS-Unity simulations across diverse and complex environments. The results demonstrate that B-ActiveSEAL achieves a well-balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off and produces diverse, adaptive exploration behaviors across environments, highlighting clear advantages over representative baselines.

### [540] [Navigation Around Unknown Space Objects Using Visible-Thermal Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12203)
*Eric J. Elias,Michael Esswein,Jonathan P. How,David W. Miller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of visible/thermal-infrared image fusion for SLAM-based navigation around resident space objects, showing that fused imagery improves performance under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in precise on-orbit navigation around unknown RSOs caused by limitations of conventional cameras and lidar under varying lighting conditions, by investigating thermal-infrared imaging and fusion techniques.

Method: The study utilizes photo-realistic visible and thermal-infrared satellite image simulations along with pixel-level image fusion methods. It then compares navigation errors using monocular SLAM for different image types in varying conditions.

Result: Fused imagery between visible and thermal-infrared cameras significantly improves navigation accuracy compared to using either visible or thermal-only images.

Conclusion: Image fusion of thermal-infrared and visible bands enhances SLAM navigation for space applications, overcoming limitations of individual imaging modalities in challenging illumination conditions.

Abstract: As the popularity of on-orbit operations grows, so does the need for precise navigation around unknown resident space objects (RSOs) such as other spacecraft, orbital debris, and asteroids. The use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms is often studied as a method to map out the surface of an RSO and find the inspector's relative pose using a lidar or conventional camera. However, conventional cameras struggle during eclipse or shadowed periods, and lidar, though robust to lighting conditions, tends to be heavier, bulkier, and more power-intensive. Thermal-infrared cameras can track the target RSO throughout difficult illumination conditions without these limitations. While useful, thermal-infrared imagery lacks the resolution and feature-richness of visible cameras. In this work, images of a target satellite in low Earth orbit are photo-realistically simulated in both visible and thermal-infrared bands. Pixel-level fusion methods are used to create visible/thermal-infrared composites that leverage the best aspects of each camera. Navigation errors from a monocular SLAM algorithm are compared between visible, thermal-infrared, and fused imagery in various lighting and trajectories. Fused imagery yields substantially improved navigation performance over visible-only and thermal-only methods.

### [541] [Measuring What Matters: Scenario-Driven Evaluation for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12211)
*Longchao Da,David Isele,Hua Wei,Manish Saroya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation pipeline for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, focusing on both accuracy and diversity, to better reflect the impact on driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction metrics like ADE and FDE focus only on accuracy but neglect the predictor’s impact on self-driving vehicles' decision-making in complex scenarios.

Method: A novel evaluation pipeline is introduced, which dynamically combines accuracy and diversity metrics based on the driving scenario's criticality to score predictors' performance.

Result: Experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed pipeline correlates better with autonomous vehicles' driving performance than traditional metrics.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a robust evaluation framework for selecting trajectory predictors that enhance safe and efficient autonomous driving.

Abstract: Being able to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents is essential for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems in dynamic situations. While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.

### [542] [Semantic Zone based 3D Map Management for Mobile Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12228)
*Huichang Yun,Seungho Yoo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semantic zone-based 3D map management method for mobile robots to enhance memory efficiency and navigation stability in large-scale indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM frameworks face challenges managing 3D maps efficiently within limited computational resources, especially in environments with spatial compartments such as hospitals and logistics centers.

Method: The paper introduces a semantic zone-based approach where indoor environments are divided into meaningful spatial units (e.g., lobbies, hallways), enabling dynamic loading of relevant zones into Working Memory (WM) while offloading inactive zones to Long-Term Memory (LTM), adhering to user-defined thresholds.

Result: Semantic zone-based management implemented in RTAB-Map led to reduced memory utilization, fewer redundant operations, and ensured stable and predictable memory usage while maintaining map accessibility for navigation.

Conclusion: Shifting from geometry-centric to semantics-centric memory control improves memory efficiency and navigation reliability for mobile robots in complex indoor spaces. Code is publicly shared for replication and further exploration.

Abstract: Mobile robots in large-scale indoor environments, such as hospitals and logistics centers, require accurate 3D spatial representations. However, 3D maps consume substantial memory, making it difficult to maintain complete map data within limited computational resources. Existing SLAM frameworks typically rely on geometric distance or temporal metrics for memory management, often resulting in inefficient data retrieval in spatially compartmentalized environments. To address this, we propose a semantic zone-based 3D map management method that shifts the paradigm from geometry-centric to semantics-centric control. Our approach partitions the environment into meaningful spatial units (e.g., lobbies, hallways) and designates these zones as the primary unit for memory management. By dynamically loading only task-relevant zones into Working Memory (WM) and offloading inactive zones to Long-Term Memory (LTM), the system strictly enforces user-defined memory thresholds. Implemented within the RTAB-Map framework, our method demonstrates substantial reductions in unnecessary signature load/unload cycles and cumulative memory utilization compared to standard approaches. The results confirm that semantic zone-based management ensures stable, predictable memory usage while preserving map availability for navigation.

### [543] [Learning to Get Up Across Morphologies: Zero-Shot Recovery with a Unified Humanoid Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12230)
*Jonathan Spraggett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a single deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that enables multiple humanoid robots with different morphologies to recover from falls without requiring separate training for each robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robot fall recovery require separate training policies for each robot morphology, which is inefficient for diverse robot designs.

Method: The authors designed a unified DRL policy trained using CrossQ. They conducted experiments on seven humanoid robots with varying physical characteristics to test the policy's ability to generalize across morphologies.

Result: The unified policy successfully achieved a zero-shot transfer rate of up to 86% on unseen robot morphologies and sometimes outperformed specialized baselines.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of morphology-agnostic control for humanoid robots, offering an efficient and generalized solution for fall recovery across different robotic designs.

Abstract: Fall recovery is a critical skill for humanoid robots in dynamic environments such as RoboCup, where prolonged downtime often decides the match. Recent techniques using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have produced robust get-up behaviors, yet existing methods require training of separate policies for each robot morphology. This paper presents a single DRL policy capable of recovering from falls across seven humanoid robots with diverse heights (0.48 - 0.81 m), weights (2.8 - 7.9 kg), and dynamics. Trained with CrossQ, the unified policy transfers zero-shot up to 86 +/- 7% (95% CI [81, 89]) on unseen morphologies, eliminating the need for robot-specific training. Comprehensive leave-one-out experiments, morph scaling analysis, and diversity ablations show that targeted morphological coverage improves zero-shot generalization. In some cases, the shared policy even surpasses the specialist baselines. These findings illustrate the practicality of morphology-agnostic control for fall recovery, laying the foundation for generalist humanoid control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a low-cost and efficient underwater localization pipeline for microFloats, addressing challenges in high-frequency position updates through a bidirectional acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF) framework and robust filtering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide an accurate, cost-effective underwater localization system for autonomous platforms, which is critical for operations in coastal waters, and improve on current methods that struggle with robustness and frequency.

Method: The method involves a bidirectional acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF) framework, integrating nonlinear trilateration and a filtering process based on geometric cost and Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds to remove outlier data caused by multipath effects and acoustic errors.

Result: The proposed approach achieved median positioning errors below 4 m and reduced mean errors from 139.29 m to 12.07 m. The method also improved the alignment of trajectories relative to GPS data and demonstrated feasibility with unrecovered floats.

Conclusion: This work enhances the utility of range-based acoustic localization techniques by improving positioning frequency, robustness, and accuracy through novel algorithmic designs. It validates the effectiveness of the approach in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Accurate underwater localization remains a challenge for inexpensive autonomous platforms that require highfrequency position updates. In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost localization pipeline for buoyancy-driven microFloats operating in coastal waters. We build upon previous work by introducing a bidirectional acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF) localization framework, which incorporates both float-to-buoy and buoy-to-float transmissions, thereby increasing the number of usable measurements. The method integrates nonlinear trilateration with a filtering of computed position estimates based on geometric cost and Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB). This approach removes outliers caused by multipath effects and other acoustic errors from the ToF estimation and improves localization robustness without relying on heavy smoothing. We validate the framework in two field deployments in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. The localization pipeline achieves median positioning errors below 4 m relative to GPS positions. The filtering technique shows a reduction in mean error from 139.29 m to 12.07 m, and improved alignment of trajectories with GPS paths. Additionally, we demonstrate a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) localization for unrecovered floats that were transmitting during the experiment. Range-based acoustic localization techniques are widely used and generally agnostic to hardware-this work aims to maximize their utility by improving positioning frequency and robustness through careful algorithmic design.

### [545] [CAR-CHASE: Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12243)
*HT To,S Nguyen,NH Pham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAR-CHASE, a method to improve Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for car-like robots by using conflict-aware caching and adaptive heuristic strategies, achieving significant computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic caching in MAPF for car-like robots fails to address the context-dependent constraints introduced by CBS algorithms, resulting in high computational costs.

Method: CAR-CHASE combines conflict-aware heuristic caching with an adaptive hybrid heuristic approach, introducing (1) compact conflict fingerprints, (2) a relevance filter for heuristic computations, and (3) adaptive switching strategies with quality bounds.

Result: CAR-CHASE achieved a 2.46× speedup on average over CL-CBS by enhancing success rates, reducing runtimes by 70.1%, and solving previously unsolvable instances in problem scenarios involving 10-30 agents and varying obstacle densities.

Conclusion: The proposed CAR-CHASE technique significantly improves computational efficiency in MAPF for car-like robots while preserving solution optimality, and it can be generalized to other CBS variants.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for car-like robots, addressed by algorithms such as Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CL-CBS), faces significant computational challenges due to expensive kinematic heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in CBS where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement), a novel approach that combines \textbf{conflict-aware heuristic caching} -- which caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context -- with an \textbf{adaptive hybrid heuristic} that intelligently switches between fast approximate and exact computations. Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) an adaptive switching strategy with theoretical quality bounds. Experimental evaluation on 480 benchmark instances with varying agent counts (10 to 30) and obstacle densities (0\% and 50\%) demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ over the baseline CL-CBS implementation while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances that previously timed out. Performance gains scale with problem complexity, reaching up to 4.06$\times$ speedup for challenging 30-agent obstacle scenarios. Our techniques are general and applicable to other CBS variants.

*Canqi Meng,Weibang Bai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new design method for soft pneumatic actuators using incised porous foam patterns to achieve programmable deformation modes like bending, tilting, and twisting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soft pneumatic actuators lack structural support and need costly, specific redesigns for different functionalities. This work explores an efficient approach by modifying porous foam bodies directly.

Method: The method involves incising specific patterns into porous foam, creating localized structural anisotropy to guide deformation under vacuum input. A computational model using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to verify the approach.

Result: The designed actuators can achieve bending up to 80°, tilting of 18°, and twisting of 115°, with experimental validation and adaptation for scalable designs.

Conclusion: This work offers a scalable, efficient, and versatile method for creating multi-functional soft porous robots, demonstrated in applications like a bio-inspired robotic hand.

Abstract: Conventional soft pneumatic actuators, typically based on hollow elastomeric chambers, often suffer from small structural support and require costly geometry-specific redesigns for multimodal functionality. Porous materials such as foam, filled into chambers, can provide structural stability for the actuators. However, methods to achieve programmable deformation by tailoring the porous body itself remain underexplored. In this paper, a novel design method is presented to realize soft porous actuators with programmable deformation by incising specific patterns into the porous foam body. This approach introduces localized structural anisotropy of the foam guiding the material's deformation under a global vacuum input. Furthermore, three fundamental patterns on a cylindrical foam substrate are discussed: transverse for bending, longitudinal for tilting, and diagonal for twisting. A computational model is built with Finite Element Analysis (FEA), to investigate the mechanism of the incision-patterning method. Experiments demonstrate that with a potential optimal design of the pattern array number N, actuators can achieve bending up to $80^{\circ}$ (N=2), tilting of $18^{\circ}$ (N=1), and twisting of $115^{\circ}$ (N=8). The versatility of our approach is demonstrated via pattern transferability, scalability, and mold-less rapid prototyping of complex designs. As a comprehensive application, we translate the human hand crease map into a functional incision pattern, creating a bio-inspired soft robot hand capable of human-like adaptive grasping. Our work provides a new, efficient, and scalable paradigm for the design of multi-functional soft porous robots.

Conclusion: INDOOR-LIDAR bridges the synthetic-real gap, offering a reliable benchmark for advancing perception in indoor robotic systems.

Abstract: We present INDOOR-LIDAR, a comprehensive hybrid dataset of indoor 3D LiDAR point clouds designed to advance research in robot perception. Existing indoor LiDAR datasets often suffer from limited scale, inconsistent annotation formats, and human-induced variability during data collection. INDOOR-LIDAR addresses these limitations by integrating simulated environments with real-world scans acquired using autonomous ground robots, providing consistent coverage and realistic sensor behavior under controlled variations. Each sample consists of dense point cloud data enriched with intensity measurements and KITTI-style annotations. The annotation schema encompasses common indoor object categories within various scenes. The simulated subset enables flexible configuration of layouts, point densities, and occlusions, while the real-world subset captures authentic sensor noise, clutter, and domain-specific artifacts characteristic of real indoor settings. INDOOR-LIDAR supports a wide range of applications including 3D object detection, bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception, SLAM, semantic scene understanding, and domain adaptation between simulated and real indoor domains. By bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data, INDOOR-LIDAR establishes a scalable, realistic, and reproducible benchmark for advancing robotic perception in complex indoor environments.

*Rudolf Reiter,Chao Qin,Leonard Bauersfeld,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Unique', a unified MPC that integrates models of different fidelity for quadrotor tasks, balancing precision and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap between precise control via high-fidelity models (inefficient for long horizons) and scalable low-fidelity planners (with performance degradation).

Method: Unique combines a high-fidelity short-horizon model for control with a low-fidelity long-horizon model for planning in a unified optimization setup. It aligns costs, enforces transition constraints, utilizes progressive smoothing for obstacles, and employs parallel MPC solvers to escape local minima.

Result: Unique improves quadrotor closed-loop performance by up to 75% in simulations and real-world tests compared to standard methods under the same computational limits.

Conclusion: Unique demonstrates robust performance improvements, confirming its effectiveness in combining high-fidelity control and efficient long-term planning.

Abstract: Many aerial tasks involving quadrotors demand both instant reactivity and long-horizon planning. High-fidelity models enable accurate control but are too slow for long horizons; low-fidelity planners scale but degrade closed-loop performance. We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines. Ablations and Pareto analyses confirm robust gains across horizon variations, constraint approximations, and smoothing schedules.

Abstract: This thesis work presents a more efficient and effective approach to training control-related tasks for humanoid robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The traditional RL methods are limited in adapting to real-world environments, complexity, and natural motions, but the proposed approach overcomes these limitations by using curriculum training and Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) technique. The results show that the developed RL policies for kicking, walking, and jumping are more dynamic, and adaptive, and outperformed previous methods. However, the transfer of the learned policy from simulation to the real world was unsuccessful, highlighting the limitations of current RL methods in fully adapting to real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses automating multi-cable unweaving, presenting a method using visual feedback and graph-based state representation, achieving successful unweaving with an 84% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automation in cable management tasks by addressing the unique challenge of multi-cable unweaving, which involves disentangling interwoven cables.

Method: They use visual feedback, a graph-based cable state representation, and a novel state transition model that predicts cable straightening and bending to plan and execute pick-and-place actions.

Result: Their method achieved an 84% success rate in unweaving cables such as electric cables and shoelaces.

Conclusion: The proposed perception-planning-action approach demonstrates effective separation of interwoven cables, paving the way for further advancements in automated cable management.

Abstract: Many cable management tasks involve separating out the different cables and removing tangles. Automating this task is challenging because cables are deformable and can have combinations of knots and multiple interwoven segments. Prior works have focused on untying knots in one cable, which is one subtask of cable management. However, in this paper, we focus on a different subtask called multi-cable unweaving, which refers to removing the intersections among multiple interwoven cables to separate them and facilitate further manipulation. We propose a method that utilizes visual feedback to unweave a bundle of loosely entangled cables. We formulate cable unweaving as a pick-and-place problem, where the grasp position is selected from discrete nodes in a graph-based cable state representation. Our cable state representation encodes both topological and geometric information about the cables from the visual image. To predict future cable states and identify valid actions, we present a novel state transition model that takes into account the straightening and bending of cables during manipulation. Using this state transition model, we select between two high-level action primitives and calculate predicted immediate costs to optimize the lower-level actions. We experimentally demonstrate that iterating the above perception-planning-action process enables unweaving electric cables and shoelaces with an 84% success rate on average.

*Zhewen Zheng,Wenjing Cao,Hongkang Yu,Mo Chen,Takashi Suzuki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework to improve tuning efficiency of nonlinear controllers in real-world experiments with limited evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interdependence of multiple gains in nonlinear geometric controllers makes manual tuning inefficient, particularly when constrained by practical evaluations.

Method: A Bayesian optimization framework using Gaussian-process surrogate is employed to optimize controller gains in a model-free and data-efficient manner.

Result: The method, tested on Honda's AI-Formula robot, improved controller performance significantly within 32 trials on a test track.

Conclusion: Bayesian optimization is demonstrated as a practical and efficient tuning approach for nonlinear path-following controllers in real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Parameter tuning in real-world experiments is constrained by the limited evaluation budget available on hardware. The path-following controller studied in this paper reflects a typical situation in nonlinear geometric controller, where multiple gains influence the dynamics through coupled nonlinear terms. Such interdependence makes manual tuning inefficient and unlikely to yield satisfactory performance within a practical number of trials. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that treats the closed-loop system as a black box and selects controller gains using a Gaussian-process surrogate. BO offers model-free exploration, quantified uncertainty, and data-efficient search, making it well suited for tuning tasks where each evaluation is costly. The framework is implemented on Honda's AI-Formula three-wheeled robot and assessed through repeated full-lap experiments on a fixed test track. The results show that BO improves controller performance within 32 trials, including 15 warm-start initial evaluations, indicating that it can efficiently locate high-performing regions of the parameter space under real-world conditions. These findings demonstrate that BO provides a practical, reliable, and data-efficient tuning approach for nonlinear path-following controllers on real robotic platforms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a coordination framework for robotic teams using MPC to improve efficiency and safety in environments involving humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in traditional coverage strategies, which fail in dynamic, real-world scenarios, and to improve robot interaction with humans and adaptability in complex environments.

Method: The proposed method, HMPCC, integrates human motion predictions into an MPC-based planning approach. It uses a Gaussian Mixture Model for environment representation, allowing decentralized operation without explicit communication.

Result: Human trajectory forecasting in the framework enables efficient, adaptive robot coverage and improves coordination between humans and robots.

Conclusion: Integrating human-aware planning into robot coordination enhances safety, adaptability, and interaction in dynamic, communication-restricted environments.

Abstract: We address the problem of coordinating a team of robots to cover an unknown environment while ensuring safe operation and avoiding collisions with non-cooperative agents. Traditional coverage strategies often rely on simplified assumptions, such as known or convex environments and static density functions, and struggle to adapt to real-world scenarios, especially when humans are involved. In this work, we propose a human-aware coverage framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), namely HMPCC, where human motion predictions are integrated into the planning process. By anticipating human trajectories within the MPC horizon, robots can proactively coordinate their actions %avoid redundant exploration, and adapt to dynamic conditions. The environment is modeled as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), representing regions of interest. Team members operate in a fully decentralized manner, without relying on explicit communication, an essential feature in hostile or communication-limited scenarios. Our results show that human trajectory forecasting enables more efficient and adaptive coverage, improving coordination between human and robotic agents.

*Mizuho Aoki,Kohei Honda,Yasuhiro Yoshimura,Takeshi Ishita,Ryo Yonetani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vision-Language Global Localization (VLG-Loc), a method using vision-language models and human-readable footprint maps to enhance robotic global localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of enabling robots to localize themselves using human-readable maps without requiring geometric and appearance details.

Method: The method uses vision-language models to match multi-directional image observations with labeled footprint maps and evaluates robot pose hypotheses within a Monte Carlo localization framework.

Result: Experimental evaluations in retail environments showed that VLG-Loc is more robust to environmental changes compared to scan-based methods and performs even better when combining visual and scan-based localization techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed VLG-Loc method effectively leverages vision-language models and human-readable maps for robust robotic localization, surpassing baseline methods, and offering potential for more adaptable navigation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents Vision-Language Global Localization (VLG-Loc), a novel global localization method that uses human-readable labeled footprint maps containing only names and areas of distinctive visual landmarks in an environment. While humans naturally localize themselves using such maps, translating this capability to robotic systems remains highly challenging due to the difficulty of establishing correspondences between observed landmarks and those in the map without geometric and appearance details. To address this challenge, VLG-Loc leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to search the robot's multi-directional image observations for the landmarks noted in the map. The method then identifies robot poses within a Monte Carlo localization framework, where the found landmarks are used to evaluate the likelihood of each pose hypothesis. Experimental validation in simulated and real-world retail environments demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing scan-based methods, particularly under environmental changes. Further improvements are achieved through the probabilistic fusion of visual and scan-based localization.

TL;DR: SAGA introduces a framework for adaptive visuomotor control, generalizing across tasks, environments, and user specifications using affordance-based task representation grounded via multimodal foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable robots to perform diverse tasks efficiently by disentangling high-level task semantics from low-level control, ensuring generalization across various contexts and environments.

Method: The paper uses affordance-based task representation and multimodal foundation models to abstract task objectives as 3D affordance heatmaps. Conditional policies are trained on these grounded representations for versatile task execution.

Result: SAGA significantly outperforms modular and end-to-end baselines in experiments across eleven real-world tasks using a quadruped manipulator.

Conclusion: Affordance grounding is an effective approach for scalable and generalist mobile manipulation, demonstrated by SAGA's superior adaptability and performance.

Abstract: We present SAGA, a versatile and adaptive framework for visuomotor control that can generalize across various environments, task objectives, and user specifications. To efficiently learn such capability, our key idea is to disentangle high-level semantic intent from low-level visuomotor control by explicitly grounding task objectives in the observed environment. Using an affordance-based task representation, we express diverse and complex behaviors in a unified, structured form. By leveraging multimodal foundation models, SAGA grounds the proposed task representation to the robot's visual observation as 3D affordance heatmaps, highlighting task-relevant entities while abstracting away spurious appearance variations that would hinder generalization. These grounded affordances enable us to effectively train a conditional policy on multi-task demonstration data for whole-body control. In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation. We instantiate SAGA on a quadrupedal manipulator and conduct extensive experiments across eleven real-world tasks. SAGA consistently outperforms end-to-end and modular baselines by substantial margins. Together, these results demonstrate that structured affordance grounding offers a scalable and effective pathway toward generalist mobile manipulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid MPC-RL framework to integrate the adaptability of RL with the stability and safety guarantees of MPC for safe and efficient control in complex engineering systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern systems like autonomous vehicles require controllers that are robust, adaptive, and safety-aware under real-time conditions. RL handles adaptability but lacks constraint satisfaction, while MPC ensures safety but is computationally demanding and model-reliant. Combining these approaches addresses these limitations.

Method: The framework uses MPC to guide RL training by defining safe control bounds for constraint-aware policy learning. During deployment, it employs a lightweight safety filter based on Lipschitz continuity to uphold constraints without heavy online optimization.

Result: When applied to a nonlinear aeroelastic wing system, this framework showed improved disturbance rejection, reduced actuator effort, and robust performance under turbulence, validating its efficacy.

Conclusion: By integrating MPC and RL, the proposed framework achieves scalable, safe, and adaptive control suitable for real-time applications, making it versatile for various engineering domains with nonlinearities and bounded disturbances.

Abstract: Modern engineering systems, such as autonomous vehicles, flexible robotics, and intelligent aerospace platforms, require controllers that are robust to uncertainties, adaptive to environmental changes, and safety-aware under real-time constraints. RL offers powerful data-driven adaptability for systems with nonlinear dynamics that interact with uncertain environments. RL, however, lacks built-in mechanisms for dynamic constraint satisfaction during exploration. MPC offers structured constraint handling and robustness, but its reliance on accurate models and computationally demanding online optimization may pose significant challenges. This paper proposes an integrated MPC-RL framework that combines stability and safety guarantees of MPC with the adaptability of RL. During training, MPC defines safe control bounds that guide the RL component and that enable constraint-aware policy learning. At deployment, the learned policy operates in real time with a lightweight safety filter based on Lipschitz continuity to ensure constraint satisfaction without heavy online optimizations. The approach, which is validated on a nonlinear aeroelastic wing system, demonstrates improved disturbance rejection, reduced actuator effort, and robust performance under turbulence. The architecture generalizes to other domains with structured nonlinearities and bounded disturbances, offering a scalable solution for safe artificial-intelligence-driven control in engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integration between fixed-category and open-language semantic predictions in current mapping systems, and to utilize advanced data structures for efficient volumetric representation.

Method: The system combines OpenVDB-based data structures with a unified Bayesian update framework for closed- and open-set semantic fusion.

Result: SLIM-VDB reduced memory usage and integration times while maintaining mapping accuracy, improving upon existing systems.

Conclusion: SLIM-VDB offers a substantial improvement in efficiency for semantic mappings with dual prediction support and public implementation for further research.

Abstract: This paper introduces SLIM-VDB, a new lightweight semantic mapping system with probabilistic semantic fusion for closed-set or open-set dictionaries. Advances in data structures from the computer graphics community, such as OpenVDB, have demonstrated significantly improved computational and memory efficiency in volumetric scene representation. Although OpenVDB has been used for geometric mapping in robotics applications, semantic mapping for scene understanding with OpenVDB remains unexplored. In addition, existing semantic mapping systems lack support for integrating both fixed-category and open-language label predictions within a single framework. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D semantic mapping system that leverages the OpenVDB data structure and integrates a unified Bayesian update framework for both closed- and open-set semantic fusion. Our proposed framework, SLIM-VDB, achieves significant reduction in both memory and integration times compared to current state-of-the-art semantic mapping approaches, while maintaining comparable mapping accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve lane-keeping systems for AVs, addressing the challenges of snowy road conditions, including uncertainties and slippage, through robust decision-making algorithms.

Method: Two DRL-based algorithms were developed: AR-RDPG, which combines multi-scale neural networks for image denoising and a DCNN for feature extraction, and AR-CADPG, an end-to-end system integrating CNN and attention mechanisms.

Result: Both methods were successfully trained in simulations and validated in real-world scenarios, confirming their feasibility. AR-CADPG outperformed AR-RDPG in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: By integrating robust temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms, AR-CADPG proves more effective for snowy conditions, setting a benchmark for autonomous vehicle lane-keeping systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes two new algorithms for the lane keeping system (LKS) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating under snowy road conditions. These algorithms use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle uncertainties and slippage. They include Action-Robust Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-RDPG) and end-to-end Action-Robust convolutional neural network Attention Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-CADPG), two action-robust approaches for decision-making. In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios. Real-world experiments on a Jetson Nano-based autonomous vehicle confirm the feasibility and stability of the learned policies. Among the two models, the AR-CADPG approach demonstrates superior path-tracking accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of combining temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms in AVs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve real-time gait generation in bipedal locomotion by leveraging compact state representations and terrain encodings to enhance efficiency and robustness.

Method: The proposed method uses a CNN-VAE to extract latent terrain encodings, integrates reduced-order robot models, incorporates history-aware latent representations, and introduces direct learning from depth camera images for real-world applications. Validation is conducted in simulation with realistic hardware conditions.

Result: The framework has demonstrated robustness and adaptability in a high-fidelity simulator, confirmed through preliminary hardware validation comparing simulated and real depth sensing data.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach showcases potential for efficient and robust terrain-aware bipedal locomotion, paving the way for practical hardware deployment.

Abstract: This work introduces a hierarchical strategy for terrain-aware bipedal locomotion that integrates reduced-dimensional perceptual representations to enhance reinforcement learning (RL)-based high-level (HL) policies for real-time gait generation. Unlike end-to-end approaches, our framework leverages latent terrain encodings via a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE) alongside reduced-order robot dynamics, optimizing the locomotion decision process with a compact state. We systematically analyze the impact of latent space dimensionality on learning efficiency and policy robustness. Additionally, we extend our method to be history-aware, incorporating sequences of recent terrain observations into the latent representation to improve robustness. To address real-world feasibility, we introduce a distillation method to learn the latent representation directly from depth camera images and provide preliminary hardware validation by comparing simulated and real sensor data. We further validate our framework using the high-fidelity Agility Robotics (AR) simulator, incorporating realistic sensor noise, state estimation, and actuator dynamics. The results confirm the robustness and adaptability of our method, underscoring its potential for hardware deployment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces K-VARK, an innovative approach combining probabilistic modeling and adaptive filtering to improve sensorless force estimation in robots, showing over 20% improvement in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensorless force estimation is critical for robot interaction with unstructured environments, but modeling errors and complex dynamics hinder accuracy.

Method: K-VARK integrates a kernelized probabilistic model of residual torques with an adaptive Kalman filter, using variances and Bayesian optimization to inform measurements and adapt noise covariances.

Result: Experimental results on a 6-DoF robot demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE and enhanced external force estimation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: K-VARK successfully provides robust sensorless external force estimation, making it applicable for precision-demanding robotic tasks like polishing and assembly.

Abstract: Reliable estimation of contact forces is crucial for ensuring safe and precise interaction of robots with unstructured environments. However, accurate sensorless force estimation remains challenging due to inherent modeling errors and complex residual dynamics and friction. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose K-VARK (Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman filter), a novel approach that integrates a kernelized, probabilistic model of joint residual torques into an adaptive Kalman filter framework. Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances. Experimental validation on a 6-DoF collaborative manipulator demonstrates that K-VARK achieves over 20% reduction in RMSE compared to state-of-the-art sensorless force estimation methods, yielding robust and accurate external force/torque estimation suitable for advanced tasks such as polishing and assembly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LCHD, a language-conditioned robot motion planning framework, that uses diffusion models with semantic priors and collision-avoidance to generate collision-free trajectories efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based motion planners struggle with high computational costs, limited generalization capabilities, and inability to handle language-conditioned multi-robot planning without explicit environment data.

Method: LCHD integrates language understanding (via CLIP semantic priors) with a physics-inspired collision-avoiding diffusion kernel to generate efficient, collision-free trajectories. It works end-to-end based on vision inputs and avoids explicit obstacle representation.

Result: LCHD outperformed existing diffusion-based planners in terms of success rate and planning latency across simulated and real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: LCHD demonstrates an efficient and reliable approach for language-conditioned motion planning in robots, improving practicality by handling challenging scenarios without detailed obstacle information.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for robot motion planning by capturing the multi-modal distribution of feasible trajectories. However, their extension to multi-robot settings with flexible, language-conditioned task specifications remains limited. Furthermore, current diffusion-based approaches incur high computational cost during inference and struggle with generalization because they require explicit construction of environment representations and lack mechanisms for reasoning about geometric reachability. To address these limitations, we present Language-Conditioned Heat-Inspired Diffusion (LCHD), an end-to-end vision-based framework that generates language-conditioned, collision-free trajectories. LCHD integrates CLIP-based semantic priors with a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel serving as a physical inductive bias that enables the planner to interpret language commands strictly within the reachable workspace. This naturally handles out-of-distribution scenarios -- in terms of reachability -- by guiding robots toward accessible alternatives that match the semantic intent, while eliminating the need for explicit obstacle information at inference time. Extensive evaluations on diverse real-world-inspired maps, along with real-robot experiments, show that LCHD consistently outperforms prior diffusion-based planners in success rate, while reducing planning latency.

Motivation: To address the sample inefficiency in reinforcement learning for humanoid robots, caused by the complex dynamics and partial observability of these systems.

Method: The authors propose PvP, a contrastive learning framework leveraging proprioceptive and privileged states to learn compact latent representations, improving policy learning without manual data augmentation. They also introduce SRL4Humanoid for evaluation.

Result: Experiments with the LimX Oli robot demonstrate that PvP improves sample efficiency and final performance in velocity tracking and motion imitation tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of PvP and SRL integration for efficient humanoid robot learning, providing insights for future applications in whole-body control.

Abstract: Achieving efficient and robust whole-body control (WBC) is essential for enabling humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in this domain, its sample inefficiency remains a significant challenge due to the intricate dynamics and partial observability of humanoid robots. To address this limitation, we propose PvP, a Proprioceptive-Privileged contrastive learning framework that leverages the intrinsic complementarity between proprioceptive and privileged states. PvP learns compact and task-relevant latent representations without requiring hand-crafted data augmentations, enabling faster and more stable policy learning. To support systematic evaluation, we develop SRL4Humanoid, the first unified and modular framework that provides high-quality implementations of representative state representation learning (SRL) methods for humanoid robot learning. Extensive experiments on the LimX Oli robot across velocity tracking and motion imitation tasks demonstrate that PvP significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance compared to baseline SRL methods. Our study further provides practical insights into integrating SRL with RL for humanoid WBC, offering valuable guidance for data-efficient humanoid robot learning.

TL;DR: The paper discusses Sequence of Experts (SoE), a novel method to address error accumulation in imitation learning (IL) for autonomous driving, enhancing robustness without increasing model complexity or data needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gradual accumulation of errors in IL during closed-loop settings often leads to severe failures. Current research focuses on enhancing robustness at single time points, overlooking the temporal nature of autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose SoE, a temporal alternation policy that leverages the continuous nature of autonomous driving processes to improve closed-loop robustness without additional model complexity or data.

Result: SoE improves the performance of autonomous driving models in closed-loop settings, demonstrated through extensive experiments on the nuPlan benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SoE presents a significant advancement in IL for autonomous driving by addressing robustness through temporal strategies, potentially enhancing training efficiency and applicability to various driving models.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has emerged as a central paradigm in autonomous driving. While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in training generalist robot policies that can effectively work on diverse robot embodiments without re-collecting data or retraining for every new setup.

Method: Introduces AugE-Toolkit, an augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, an expanded dataset with over 4.4 million trajectories, leveraging diverse robot embodiments for enhancing cross-embodiment learning.

Result: Improved policy performance on both augmented and unseen robots, achieving significant performance gains (24-45%) in real-world manipulation tasks using state-of-the-art generalist policies after fine-tuning on OXE-AugE.

Conclusion: Augmenting datasets with diverse robot embodiments aids in generalist policy development, supporting better transfer learning and robustness in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Large and diverse datasets are needed for training generalist robot policies that have potential to control a variety of robot embodiments -- robot arm and gripper combinations -- across diverse tasks and environments. As re-collecting demonstrations and retraining for each new hardware platform are prohibitively costly, we show that existing robot data can be augmented for transfer and generalization. The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations. We present AugE-Toolkit, a scalable robot augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, a high-quality open-source dataset that augments OXE with 9 different robot embodiments. OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $π_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

### [566] [START: Traversing Sparse Footholds with Terrain Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13153)
*Ruiqi Yu,Qianshi Wang,Hongyi Li,Zheng Jun,Zhicheng Wang,Jun Wu,Qiuguo Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: START introduces a learning framework for quadruped robots to achieve agile and stable locomotion on terrains with sparse footholds using low-cost onboard vision and proprioception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for quadruped robots struggle with flexibility, adaptability, and inefficiencies related to either model-based hierarchical controllers or end-to-end learning methods.

Method: START uses a single-stage learning framework to reconstruct local terrain heightmaps, integrating vision and proprioception for better environmental understanding and precision.

Result: Experimental tests confirm START's ability to transfer zero-shot to a range of real-world scenarios, demonstrating adaptability, accurate foothold placement, and robustness.

Conclusion: START addresses the shortcomings of previous methods and significantly enhances quadruped robot performance in challenging and diverse terrain scenarios.

Abstract: Traversing terrains with sparse footholds like legged animals presents a promising yet challenging task for quadruped robots, as it requires precise environmental perception and agile control to secure safe foot placement while maintaining dynamic stability. Model-based hierarchical controllers excel in laboratory settings, but suffer from limited generalization and overly conservative behaviors. End-to-end learning-based approaches unlock greater flexibility and adaptability, but existing state-of-the-art methods either rely on heightmaps that introduce noise and complex, costly pipelines, or implicitly infer terrain features from egocentric depth images, often missing accurate critical geometric cues and leading to inefficient learning and rigid gaits. To overcome these limitations, we propose START, a single-stage learning framework that enables agile, stable locomotion on highly sparse and randomized footholds. START leverages only low-cost onboard vision and proprioception to accurately reconstruct local terrain heightmap, providing an explicit intermediate representation to convey essential features relevant to sparse foothold regions. This supports comprehensive environmental understanding and precise terrain assessment, reducing exploration cost and accelerating skill acquisition. Experimental results demonstrate that START achieves zero-shot transfer across diverse real-world scenarios, showcasing superior adaptability, precise foothold placement, and robust locomotion.

*Deepak Ingole,Valentin Bhend,Shiva Ganesh Murali,Oliver Dobrich,Alisa Rupenayan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative learning framework for automating the tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) based on task-level feedback, validated through a robotic simulation achieving efficient results with minimal repetitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of control retuning in manufacturing processes caused by environmental drifts and system wear, aiming to improve efficiency and adaptability during repetitive operations.

Method: The authors designed a framework inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC) to adjust NMPC weighting matrices (Q and R) iteratively, based on performance feedback. An empirical sensitivity matrix enables updates without requiring analytic derivatives.

Result: The approach was validated via simulation on a UR10e robot tasked with carbon fiber winding. It achieved near-optimal tracking performance within 4 task repetitions, significantly outperforming traditional methods like Bayesian Optimization in terms of required iterations.

Conclusion: This adaptive tuning method demonstrates high efficiency and practicality for NMPC in robotics and manufacturing, merging optimal control precision with real-time adaptability.

Abstract: Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.

### [568] [Efficient Generation of Smooth Paths with Curvature Guarantees by Mollification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13183)
*Alfredo González-Calvin,Juan F. Jiménez,Héctor García de Marina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study proposes a computationally efficient method to convert non-differentiable paths into differentiable ones using mollification, ensuring the feasibility of these paths for real-time robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing trajectory tracking algorithms which exclude non-differentiable paths, despite their practicality in describing robot missions.

Method: The authors employ mollification to approximate non-differentiable paths with differentiable ones and introduce a systematic method to bound the curvature of these paths.

Result: The method proved capable of approximating paths with arbitrary precision, resulting in paths compatible with standard algorithms, all while allowing real-time implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach brings computational efficiency, enabling its use in real-time systems and ensuring compatibility with existing path following and trajectory tracking methods for robotics.

Abstract: Most path following and trajectory tracking algorithms in mobile robotics require the desired path or trajectory to be defined by at least twice continuously differentiable functions to guarantee key properties such as global convergence, especially for nonholonomic robots like unicycles with speed constraints. Consequently, these algorithms typically exclude continuous but non-differentiable paths, such as piecewise functions. Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on microcontrollers and compatibility with standard trajectory tracking and path following algorithms.

*Yinsong Qu,Yunxiang Li,Shanlin Zhong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) framework for navigating autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in complex environments, achieving enhanced obstacle avoidance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating AMRs in cluttered and semi-structured environments is challenging due to vehicle dynamics, interaction with obstacles, and non-convexity in operational spaces.

Method: The proposed ISMPC framework includes: 1) a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm for collision avoidance using convex regions, and 2) a sequential MPC navigation framework integrating corridor and barrier function constraints.

Result: Experiments show that ISMPC improves free-space utilization by 41.05% and achieves efficient real-time performance with a corridor generation latency of 3 ms.

Conclusion: ISMPC enhances AMRs navigation by streamlining velocity generation, improving obstacle avoidance, and maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for dense operational environments.

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have become indispensable in industrial applications due to their operational flexibility and efficiency. Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms).

Result: PyCAALP computes feasible production sequences efficiently, reduces computational time for MIP formulations, and balances engineering constraints while offering flexibility and customization.

Conclusion: PyCAALP provides an impactful, open-source solution for advancing engineering research and facilitating efficient, automated planning in industrial applications.

Abstract: This paper presents PyCAALP (Python-based Computer-Aided Assembly Line Planning), a framework for automated Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) and Production Line Planning (PLP), employing a graph-based approach to model components and joints within production modules. The framework integrates kinematic boundary conditions, such as potential part collisions, to guarantee the feasibility of automated assembly planning. The developed algorithm computes all feasible production sequences, integrating modules for detecting spatial relationships and formulating geometric constraints. The algorithm incorporates additional attributes, including handling feasibility, tolerance matching, and joint compatibility, to manage the high combinatorial complexity inherent in assembly sequence generation. Heuristics, such as Single-Piece Flow assembly and geometrical constraint enforcement, are utilized to further refine the solution space, facilitating more efficient planning for complex assemblies. The PLP stage is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), balancing the total times of a fixed number of manufacturing stations. While some complexity reduction techniques may sacrifice optimality, they significantly reduce the MIPs computational time. Furthermore, the framework enables customization of engineering constraints and supports a flexible trade-off between ASP and PLP. The open-source nature of the framework, available at https://github.com/TUM-utg/PyCAALP, promotes further collaboration and adoption in both industrial and production research applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve safety and realism in multi-agent interactive motion behavior modeling for autonomous driving, overcoming dataset biases and compounding errors.

Method: Develop GRBO for reinforcement learning-based post-training and Warm-K for test-time motion selection strategies.

Result: GRBO enhances safety performance by over 40% using minimal data while maintaining realism, and Warm-K improves test-time behavioral consistency and reactivity.

Conclusion: The proposed methods resolve key challenges in interactive behavior learning, striking a balance between realism, safety, and consistency in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Learning interactive motion behaviors among multiple agents is a core challenge in autonomous driving. While imitation learning models generate realistic trajectories, they often inherit biases from datasets dominated by safe demonstrations, limiting robustness in safety-critical cases. Moreover, most studies rely on open-loop evaluation, overlooking compounding errors in closed-loop execution. We address these limitations with two complementary strategies. First, we propose Group Relative Behavior Optimization (GRBO), a reinforcement learning post-training method that fine-tunes pretrained behavior models via group relative advantage maximization with human regularization. Using only 10% of the training dataset, GRBO improves safety performance by over 40% while preserving behavioral realism. Second, we introduce Warm-K, a warm-started Top-K sampling strategy that balances consistency and diversity in motion selection. Our Warm-K method-based test-time scaling enhances behavioral consistency and reactivity at test time without retraining, mitigating covariate shift and reducing performance discrepancies. Demo videos are available in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There’s a need for accurate and real-time dynamic models for CDCRs to enhance high-speed dynamics prediction and enable model-based control.

Method: The LASEM framework formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space, employs a unified variational derivation, reduces governing dynamics to a single PDE, and avoids explicit cable-backbone contact force computation. It supports both force-input and displacement-input actuation modes.

Result: The framework achieves a 62.3% computational speedup over existing state-of-the-art real-time dynamic modeling methods.

Conclusion: LASEM simplifies dynamic modeling for CDCRs, ensuring physical consistency and geometric accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) require accurate, real-time dynamic models for high-speed dynamics prediction or model-based control, making such capability an urgent need. In this paper, we propose the Lightweight Actuation-Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for CDCRs, which formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space to enable lightweight yet accurate dynamic modeling. Through a unified variational derivation, the governing dynamics reduce to a single partial differential equation (PDE), requiring only the Euler moment balance while implicitly incorporating the Newton force balance. By also avoiding explicit computation of cable-backbone contact forces, the formulation simplifies the model structure and improves computational efficiency while preserving geometric accuracy and physical consistency. Importantly, the proposed framework for dynamic modeling natively supports both force-input and displacement-input actuation modes, a capability seldom achieved in existing dynamic formulations. Leveraging this lightweight structure, a Galerkin space-time modal discretization with analytical time-domain derivatives of the reduced state further enables an average 62.3% computational speedup over state-of-the-art real-time dynamic modeling approaches.

Motivation: To enhance multi-robot social formation navigation in environments with unpredictable pedestrian behaviors and challenges in coordinated exploration.

Method: The authors developed a novel RL algorithm introducing intrinsic motivation exploration with a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism. It operates within a dual-sampling, centralized training, and decentralized execution framework, utilizing a two-time-scale update rule.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks for social formation navigation.

Conclusion: Using intrinsic motivation and advanced coordination strategies in RL enables superior navigation performance for multi-robot systems in social environments.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to multi-robot social formation navigation, a critical capability for enabling seamless human-robot coexistence. While RL offers a promising paradigm, the inherent unpredictability and often uncooperative dynamics of pedestrian behavior pose substantial challenges, particularly concerning the efficiency of coordinated exploration among robots. To address this, we propose a novel coordinated-exploration multi-robot RL algorithm introducing an intrinsic motivation exploration. Its core component is a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism designed to collectively alleviate policy conservatism. Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates. Empirical results on social formation navigation benchmarks demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across crucial metrics.

Motivation: To achieve robust and agile running behavior in humanoid robots that can adapt to various challenges such as uneven stepping stones, obstacles, and disturbances.

Method: The paper develops a framework with automated spring-mass trajectory and deadbeat control gain library generation, trajectory selection policies, and whole-body control methods for humanoid modeling.

Result: The proposed framework successfully handles challenging behaviors including running through random stepping stones, obstacle jumping, and rejecting disturbances, demonstrated in simulations with noise and uncertainties.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and effective across a range of tasks without manual tuning, proving its real-world applicability with automatic library computation for different trajectories.

Abstract: This study proposes a step adaptation framework for running through spring-mass trajectories and deadbeat control gain libraries. It includes four main parts: (1) Automatic spring-mass trajectory library generation; (2) Deadbeat control gain library generation through an actively controlled template model that resembles the whole-body dynamics well; (3) Trajectory selection policy development for step adaptation; (4) Mapping spring-mass trajectories to a humanoid model through a whole-body control (WBC) framework also accounting for closed-kinematic chain systems, self collisions, and reactive limb swinging. We show the inclusiveness and the robustness of the proposed framework through various challenging and agile behaviors such as running through randomly generated stepping stones, jumping over random obstacles, performing slalom motions, changing the running direction suddenly with a random leg, and rejecting significant disturbances and uncertainties through the MuJoCo physics simulator. We also perform additional simulations under a comprehensive set of uncertainties and noise to better justify the proposed method's robustness to real-world challenges, including signal noise, imprecision, modeling errors, and delays. All the aforementioned behaviors are performed with a single library and the same set of WBC control parameters without additional tuning. The spring-mass and the deadbeat control gain library are automatically computed in 4.5 seconds in total for 315 different trajectories.

The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of RL-based 6-DOF AUV position control in real-world settings, showcasing its robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) require reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) position control to operate effectively in complex and dynamic marine environments. Traditional controllers are effective under nominal conditions but exhibit degraded performance when faced with unmodeled dynamics or environmental disturbances. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful alternative but training is typically slow and sim-to-real transfer remains challenging. This work introduces a GPU-accelerated RL training pipeline built in JAX and MuJoCo-XLA (MJX). By jointly JIT-compiling large-scale parallel physics simulation and learning updates, we achieve training times of under two minutes.Through systematic evaluation of multiple RL algorithms, we show robust 6-DOF trajectory tracking and effective disturbance rejection in real underwater experiments, with policies transferred zero-shot from simulation. Our results provide the first explicit real-world demonstration of RL-based AUV position control across all six degrees of freedom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in functional grasping for manipulation tasks, such as goal/reward specification, multi-task exploration, and sim-to-real transfer.

Method: The method uses a factorized RL framework combining grasping style and affordance, reformulates RL as demonstration editing, and incorporates a vision-language model for autonomous instructions.

Result: DemoFunGrasp successfully generalizes to unseen object-affordance-style combinations, improving success rates and accuracy, validated through simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed DemoFunGrasp method advances functional grasping capabilities, achieving better generalization, sim-to-real transfer, and instruction-following abilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in dexterous grasping, significantly improving grasp performance and generalization from simulation to the real world. However, fine-grained functional grasping, which is essential for downstream manipulation tasks, remains underexplored and faces several challenges: the complexity of specifying goals and reward functions for functional grasps across diverse objects, the difficulty of multi-task RL exploration, and the challenge of sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose DemoFunGrasp for universal dexterous functional grasping. We factorize functional grasping conditions into two complementary components - grasping style and affordance - and integrate them into an RL framework that can learn to grasp any object with any functional grasping condition. To address the multi-task optimization challenge, we leverage a single grasping demonstration and reformulate the RL problem as one-step demonstration editing, substantially enhancing sample efficiency and performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world show that DemoFunGrasp generalizes to unseen combinations of objects, affordances, and grasping styles, outperforming baselines in both success rate and functional grasping accuracy. In addition to strong sim-to-real capability, by incorporating a vision-language model (VLM) for planning, our system achieves autonomous instruction-following grasp execution.

Result: The proposed RL framework achieves reliable and stable docking performance for the Int-Ball2 robot under varying microgravity conditions and constraints.

Conclusion: The research establishes a foundation for extending the application of the Int-Ball2 robot in areas like collision-aware navigation, safe RL, physics-accurate sim-to-real transfer, and vision-based docking in space environments.

Abstract: Autonomous free-flyers play a critical role in intravehicular tasks aboard the International Space Station (ISS), where their precise docking under sensing noise, small actuation mismatches, and environmental variability remains a nontrivial challenge. This work presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) docking of JAXA's Int-Ball2 robot inside a high-fidelity Isaac Sim model of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we train and evaluate controllers under domain-randomized dynamics and bounded observation noise, while explicitly modeling propeller drag-torque effects and polarity structure. This enables a controlled study of how Int-Ball2's propulsion physics influence RL-based docking performance in constrained microgravity interiors. The learned policy achieves stable and reliable docking across varied conditions and lays the groundwork for future extensions pertaining to Int-Ball2 in collision-aware navigation, safe RL, propulsion-accurate sim-to-real transfer, and vision-based end-to-end docking.

*Li-Wei Shih,Ruo-Syuan Mei,Jesse Heidrich,Hui-Ping Wang,Joel Hooton,Joshua Solomon,Jorge Arinez,Guangze Li,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a near-field perception framework for AMRs using three methods—light-discontinuity detection, light-displacement measurement, and AI-based object detection. It achieves accurate and real-time performance using a Raspberry Pi 5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ranging sensors often fail to detect small objects in the near-field region, posing safety challenges for autonomous mobile robots in manufacturing environments.

Method: The framework comprises three tiers: light-discontinuity detection for binary obstacle sensing, light-displacement measurement for object height estimation, and computer vision-based object classification using AI hardware, implemented on Raspberry Pi 5.

Result: The system achieves real-time performance (25/50 FPS) with high precision, balancing computational and cost efficiency. It was experimentally validated and compared with other methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates an effective, scalable solution for improving safety and operation of AMRs in manufacturing environments through a novel, hierarchical sensing framework.

Abstract: Near-field perception is essential for the safe operation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in manufacturing environments. Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexWM is a new world model for dexterous manipulation that predicts future states conditioned on past states and actions, achieving superior performance and zero-shot generalization in manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving precise dexterous manipulation which requires detailed understanding of how hand motion impacts object interaction, and overcome the lack of large datasets for dexterous tasks.

Method: The DexWM model predicts the next latent state of the environment using past states and actions. It utilizes videos from human and non-dexterous robots (900+ hours) and introduces an auxiliary hand consistency loss to ensure finer detail in hand configurations.

Result: DexWM surpasses existing world models in accuracy for future state prediction and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization abilities. It achieves 50% better performance on average in manipulation tasks than Diffusion Policy when tested with a robotic arm.

Conclusion: DexWM is a robust and effective model for dexterous manipulation, showcasing its capability in handling unseen tasks and advancing the field of robotic manipulation through enhanced predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is challenging because it requires understanding how subtle hand motion influences the environment through contact with objects. We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.

TL;DR: RoboTracer introduces a novel 3D-aware model capable of spatial referring and measuring, supported by a new large-scale dataset and benchmark, achieving superior performance in spatial tracing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robotic spatial tracing, which requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning and handling complex real-world spatial measurements.

Method: RoboTracer uses a universal spatial encoder and regression-supervised decoder for scale awareness, with SFT training and RFT leveraging metric-sensitive rewards for improved reasoning. A new dataset and benchmark were developed to support training and evaluation.

Result: RoboTracer outperformed baselines with a success rate of 79.1% and achieving SOTA on TraceSpatial-Bench, surpassing existing models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: RoboTracer is highly effective for spatial tracing and can be applied to dynamic robotic tasks in diverse environments, showcasing its versatility and superior capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

### [585] [NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670)
*Licheng Luo,Yu Xia,Kaier Liang,Mingyu Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpaTiaL, a framework for expressing geometric spatial requirements in robotic manipulation through spatio-temporal logic and proposes the NL2SpaTiaL dataset and a translation-verification framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation tasks heavily rely on spatial requirements, and existing works only address trajectory-level concerns using standard temporal logic, neglecting detailed object-level relations.

Method: The authors developed a dataset generation framework creating SpaTiaL specifications and natural language descriptions, coupled with a semantics-preserving checker to ensure translation accuracy.

Result: Experiments confirm SpaTiaL improved interpretability, verification, and compositional task representation, showcasing superior grounding compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: SpaTiaL formalism better represents the complex spatial and temporal aspects of robotic manipulation, improving instruction-following capabilities and grounding.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

TL;DR: This paper examines the tradeoffs in Vibe Coding (VC), where generative AI assists in software development, specifically rapid prototyping, and identifies risks such as technical debt and architectural inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address risks associated with VC, particularly focusing on the trade-offs between fast code generation and sustainable software development practices.

Method: The authors base their analysis on internally developed MVPs, industry reports, and identify specific risks and limitations in VC processes.

Result: VC introduces risks such as architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance due to biases, process weaknesses, and prioritization of rapid results.

Conclusion: The paper proposes countermeasures to tackle risks in VC, aiming for sustainable development practices and informing future research and industry practices.

Abstract: Vibe Coding (VC) is a form of software development assisted by generative AI, in which developers describe the intended functionality or logic via natural language prompts, and the AI system generates the corresponding source code. VC can be leveraged for rapid prototyping or developing the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs); however, it may introduce several risks throughout the software development life cycle. Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development. Based on our experiences, we identify and explain how current model, platform, and hardware limitations contribute to these issues, and propose countermeasures to address them, informing research and practice towards more sustainable VC approaches.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for further SE research into strengthening and systematically addressing container system risks, proposing future work on mitigation strategies and security-enhancing solutions.

Abstract: Software containers are widely adopted for developing and deploying software applications. Despite their popularity, major security concerns arise during container development and deployment. Software Engineering (SE) research literature reveals a lack of reviewed, aggregated, and organized knowledge of risks, vulnerabilities, security practices, and tools in container-based systems development and deployment. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on 129 selected primary studies to explore and organize existing knowledge on security issues in software container systems. Data from the primary studies enabled us to identify critical risks and vulnerabilities across the container life-cycle and categorize them using a novel taxonomy. Additionally, the findings highlight the causes and implications and provide a list of mitigation techniques to overcome these risks and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we provide an aggregation of security practices and tools that can help support and improve the overall security of container systems. This study offers critical insights into the current landscape of security issues within software container systems. Our analysis highlights the need for future SE research to focus on security enhancement practices that strengthen container systems and develop effective mitigation strategies to comprehensively address existing risks and vulnerabilities.

### [588] [Evaluating Asynchronous Semantics in Trace-Discovered Resilience Models: A Case Study on the OpenTelemetry Demo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12314)
*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses a resilience model for microservices using trace-derived service graphs and Monte Carlo simulations. It demonstrates its effectiveness and evaluates the effect of asynchronous dependencies with negligible impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and automate resilience modeling for microservices, which is largely manual and customized in practice.

Method: They derive a service dependency graph from raw OpenTelemetry traces, attach endpoint-specific attributes, and simulate availability using Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, they assess asynchronous dependencies using Kafka semantics.

Result: The model effectively reproduces availability degradation curves during chaos experiments. The impact of asynchronous modeling on availability predictions was found to be negligible.

Conclusion: A simpler connectivity-only model suffices for immediate HTTP availability in microservices, negating the necessity to model asynchronous dependencies explicitly in the studied case.

Abstract: While distributed tracing and chaos engineering are becoming standard for microservices, resilience models remain largely manual and bespoke. We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo ("Astronomy Shop") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ModelSelect, an evidence-based framework that uses Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) principles for reliable and reproducible AI model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI model selection is often ad hoc and lacks reproducibility and transparency, challenging research software quality.

Method: The framework integrates automated data pipelines, a knowledge graph, and MCDM principles. Validation was done using 50 case studies and comparative experiments.

Result: ModelSelect provides reliable, interpretable, and reproducible recommendations, achieving high alignment with expert reasoning and superior traceability compared to generative AI systems.

Conclusion: ModelSelect enhances research software engineering by offering a scalable, evidence-driven approach to AI model selection, improving decision-making quality and reproducibility.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) models and methods presents growing challenges for research software engineers and researchers who must select, integrate, and maintain appropriate models within complex research workflows. Model selection is often performed in an ad hoc manner, relying on fragmented metadata and individual expertise, which can undermine reproducibility, transparency, and overall research software quality.
  This work proposes a structured and evidence-driven approach to support AI model selection that aligns with both technical and contextual requirements. We conceptualize AI model selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem and introduce an evidence-based decision-support framework that integrates automated data collection pipelines, a structured knowledge graph, and MCDM principles. Following the Design Science Research methodology, the proposed framework (ModelSelect) is empirically validated through 50 real-world case studies and comparative experiments against leading generative AI systems.
  The evaluation results show that ModelSelect produces reliable, interpretable, and reproducible recommendations that closely align with expert reasoning. Across the case studies, the framework achieved high coverage and strong rationale alignment in both model and library recommendation tasks, performing comparably to generative AI assistants while offering superior traceability and consistency.
  By framing AI model selection as an MCDM problem, this work establishes a rigorous foundation for transparent and reproducible decision support in research software engineering. The proposed framework provides a scalable and explainable pathway for integrating empirical evidence into AI model recommendation processes, ultimately improving the quality and robustness of research software decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable enterprise systems to benefit from the performance boosts of quantum computing by addressing software architectural challenges.

Method: Proposes a loosely coupled, distributed service-based architecture and demonstrates it using BPMN models and two case studies in operations research.

Result: Developed a stable and reusable quantum software pipeline integrated into enterprise systems, validated by two combinatorial problem-solving case studies.

Conclusion: The architecture facilitates the integration of quantum computing in enterprise systems, proving its stability and reusability across different tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises a remarkable performance boost for certain applications, including computational intensive problems addressed by enterprise systems. However, software architectures of enterprise systems must consider specific characteristics and quality attributes when collaborating with quantum computing services. Hence, this paper presents a modular reference architecture for embedding quantum software into enterprise systems. Its building blocks consist of loosely coupled and distributed services that implement both quantum-independent and quantum-specific tasks. Although these services either depend on the business domain or the selected quantum algorithm, their orchestration forms a stable and reusable pipeline, specified as an executable BPMN model. For demonstration and evaluation purposes, the proposed reference architecture is utilized in two case studies addressing combinatorial challenges from the field of operations research.

### [592] [Hyper model checking for high-level relational models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12024)
*Nuno Macedo,Hugo Pacheco*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperPardinus, an extension of Alloy's Pardinus backend, to verify hyperproperties automatically using low-level model checkers, addressing design models early in development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of high-level specification languages for verifying hyperproperties at early system design stages, despite advances in model checking.

Method: The authors developed HyperPardinus, which extends Pardinus in Alloy to encode and automatically verify hyperproperties through low-level model checkers and enable visualization of counterexamples.

Result: The solution allows modeling and verification of complex hyperproperties, including those with alternating quantifiers, proving effective for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: HyperPardinus effectively bridges the gap in verifying hyperproperties during early design stages, simplifying modeling, verification, and example visualization.

Abstract: Many properties related to security or concurrency must be encoded as so-called hyperproperties, temporal properties that allow reasoning about multiple traces of a system. However, despite recent advances on model checking hyperproperties, there is still a lack of higher-level specification languages that can effectively support software engineering practitioners in verifying properties of this class at early stages of system design.
  Alloy is a lightweight formal method with a high-level specification language that is supported by automated analysis procedures, making it particularly well-suited for the verification of design models at early development stages. It does not natively support, however, the verification of hyperproperties.
  This work proposes HyperPardinus, a new model finding procedure that extends Pardinus -- the temporal logic backend of the Alloy language -- to automatically verify hyperproperties over relational models by relying on existing low-level model checkers for hyperproperties. It then conservatively extends Alloy to support the specification and automatic verification of hyperproperties over design models, as well as the visualization of (counter-)examples at a higher-level of abstraction. Evaluation shows that our approach enables modeling and finding (counter-)examples for complex hyperproperties with alternating quantifiers, making it feasible to address relevant scenarios from the state of the art.

*Gökberk Çelikmasat,Atay Özgövde,Fatma Başak Aydemir*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents 'InstruBPM', a method for adapting open-weight large language models to generate high-quality BPMN process models from natural language descriptions, tackling the expert and time-intensive barrier of standard modeling practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to tackle the challenges practitioners face with domain modeling, which is often skipped due to being time-intensive and requiring rare expertise. The authors aim to leverage open-weight large language models, adapted through instruction tuning, to simplify and improve the modeling process.

Method: The authors developed 'InstruBPM', a pipeline that includes preparing paired text-diagram data, applying instruction-tuned fine-tuning with parameter-efficient methods, and deploying a quantized model for on-prem use. They validate the approach using multiple evaluation criteria including BLEU, ROUGE-L, structural fidelity, guidelines adherence, and expert review.

Result: 'InstruBPM' outperformed untuned baseline models in sequence and structure metrics, with additional guideline analyses and expert feedback affirming BPMN best practices adherence and usefulness for modeling. It also required fewer computational resources and showed improved robustness and accuracy without relying heavily on prompt scaffolding.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning is a cost-effective method to enhance structural accuracy and robustness in generating BPMN process models, offering professionals a simpler and resource-friendly approach to domain modeling. The trained models and scripts have been publicly shared to encourage further replication and research.

Abstract: Domain models are central to software engineering, as they enable a shared understanding, guide implementation, and support automated analyses and model-driven development. Yet, despite these benefits, practitioners often skip modeling because it is time-consuming and demands scarce expertise. We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding. We publicly share the trained models and scripts to support reproducibility and further research.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the problem of hallucinations in LLMs when comprehending codebases, emphasizing citation accuracy through hybrid retrieval and structural reasoning, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and no hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address hallucinations in LLMs for code comprehension to improve citation reliability and developer assistance where incorrect references hinder usability.

Method: The study employs a hybrid retrieval system integrating BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion to enhance evidence discovery beyond textual similarity.

Result: Achieved 92% citation accuracy with zero hallucinations and improved performance by 14-18 percentage points over baselines. Discovered cross-file evidence in 62% of architectural queries.

Conclusion: Citation grounded generation is crucial for code comprehension systems, showcasing better accuracy and reliability, especially in cross-file evidence discovery.

Abstract: Large language models have become essential tools for code comprehension, enabling developers to query unfamiliar codebases through natural language interfaces. However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries.

TL;DR: SWE-Playground introduces a new pipeline to generate synthetic coding tasks and projects for training versatile coding agents, overcoming limitations of reliance on pre-existing GitHub issues and narrow task dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to training software engineering agents relied heavily on existing GitHub repositories and were constrained to issue resolution tasks, hindering broader task diversity and adaptability.

Method: SWE-Playground generates synthetic projects and tasks from scratch using advanced language models and agents, removing the dependence on external data sources and enabling a wider variety of coding tasks.

Result: SWE-Playground outperforms previous methods by producing high-density training signals, requiring fewer trajectories to achieve comparable performance.

Conclusion: SWE-Playground expands the scope of training tasks for coding agents with a synthetic approach and demonstrates improved efficiency and adaptability in training.

Abstract: Prior works on training software engineering agents have explored utilizing existing resources such as issues on GitHub repositories to construct software engineering tasks and corresponding test suites. These approaches face two key limitations: (1) their reliance on pre-existing GitHub repositories offers limited flexibility, and (2) their primary focus on issue resolution tasks restricts their applicability to the much wider variety of tasks a software engineer must handle. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SWE-Playground, a novel pipeline for generating environments and trajectories which supports the training of versatile coding agents. Unlike prior efforts, SWE-Playground synthetically generates projects and tasks from scratch with strong language models and agents, eliminating reliance on external data sources. This allows us to tackle a much wider variety of coding tasks, such as reproducing issues by generating unit tests and implementing libraries from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three distinct benchmarks, and results indicate that SWE-Playground produces trajectories with dense training signal, enabling agents to reach comparable performance with significantly fewer trajectories than previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in software analytics data used for JIT defect prediction, where existing anonymization methods fail to preserve contextual dependencies within software metrics.

Method: The method involves grouping software metrics-based commits into clusters and leveraging LLMs to create context-specific anonymization parameters, enhancing privacy without hindering predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective adaptive anonymization tools, retaining both privacy and predictive utility in software analytics by considering contextual statistical relationships among data points.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning (ML) for Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction raises concerns about privacy leakage from software analytics data. Existing anonymization methods, such as tabular transformations and graph perturbations, often overlook contextual dependencies among software metrics, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual and statistical relationships within JIT datasets. Our method groups commits into feature-based clusters and employs an LLM to generate context-aware parameter configurations for each commit cluster, defining alpha-beta ratios and churn mixture distributions used for anonymization. Our evaluation on six projects (Cassandra, Flink, Groovy, Ignite, OpenStack, and Qt) shows that our LLM-based approach achieves privacy level 2 (IPR >= 80 percent), improving privacy by 18 to 25 percent over four state-of-the-art graph-based anonymization baselines while maintaining comparable F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can act as adaptive anonymization engines when provided with cluster-specific statistical information about similar data points, enabling context-sensitive and privacy-preserving software analytics without compromising predictive accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing complexity of systems and the limitations of manual penetration testing methodologies by exploring AI-driven enhancements.

Method: A systematic literature review analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major databases on AI's role in penetration testing.

Result: AI shows promise in automating repetitive tasks and optimizing attack strategies, with real-world tools like PenBox suggesting potential. However, gaps exist in flexibility, the reconnaissance phase, and LLM applications.

Conclusion: Despite its early stage, AI-assisted penetration testing offers significant potential for automation and efficiency. Future research should address current challenges and explore less-developed areas like LLM applications.

Abstract: Penetration testing is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, traditionally driven by manual, time-intensive processes. As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration. This paper offers a critical overview of AI's current and potential role in penetration testing, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and organizations aiming to enhance security assessments through advanced automation or looking for gaps in existing research.

*Jaid Monwar Chowdhury,Ahmad Farhan Shahriar Chowdhury,Humayra Binte Monwar,Mahmuda Naznin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based tool for enhanced code analysis, addressing limitations of traditional methods and Large Language Models in understanding complex structural relationships in code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of software systems reveals the inefficiency of traditional programming analysis and challenges in understanding structural relationships in code, especially for C and C++.

Method: ATLAS generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG), type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG), and unified multi-view code representations using AST, CFG, and DFG.

Result: ATLAS facilitates analysis of entire C/C++ projects, including non-compilable code, while maintaining structural and semantic information crucial for SE and machine-learning applications.

Conclusion: ATLAS enhances program understanding by enabling an effective multi-layered representation of code, overcoming key challenges in static analysis for complex software systems.

Abstract: The growing complexity of modern software systems has highlighted the shortcomings of traditional programming analysis techniques, particularly for Software Engineering (SE) tasks. While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data. Unlike natural language, source code meaning is defined less by token adjacency and more by complex, long-range, and structural relationships and dependencies. This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG. By preserving essential structural and semantic information, ATLAS provides a practical foundation for improving downstream SE and machine-learning-based program understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying how aggregating outputs from diverse LLMs can overcome individual model shortcomings in Software Vulnerability Detection and Repair.

Method: DVDR-LLM uses an ensemble framework by combining outputs from multiple LLMs, evaluating accuracy improvements based on code complexity and multi-file vulnerabilities.

Result: 10-12% improved detection accuracy, +18% recall, +11.8% F1 score in multi-file vulnerabilities; trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

Conclusion: An ensemble approach helps balance detection accuracy and challenges in complex vulnerabilities, while requiring adjustment of the threshold levels for varied security contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being studied for Software Vulnerability Detection (SVD) and Repair (SVR). Individual LLMs have demonstrated code understanding abilities, but they frequently struggle when identifying complex vulnerabilities and generating fixes.
  This study presents DVDR-LLM, an ensemble framework that combines outputs from diverse LLMs to determine whether aggregating multiple models reduces error rates. Our evaluation reveals that DVDR-LLM achieves 10-12% higher detection accuracy compared to the average performance of individual models, with benefits increasing as code complexity grows. For multi-file vulnerabilities, the ensemble approach demonstrates significant improvements in recall (+18%) and F1 score (+11.8%) over individual models. However, the approach raises measurable trade-offs: reducing false positives in verification tasks while simultaneously increasing false negatives in detection tasks, requiring careful decision on the required level of agreement among the LLMs (threshold) for increased performance across different security contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve software vulnerability detection due to limitations in traditional techniques like static and dynamic analysis, which are ineffective at detecting multiple vulnerabilities.

Method: A CNN-based deep learning approach was utilized, with a 5-split cross-validation strategy for training and evaluating the model. The model uses tokenized source code as input.

Result: Sherlock demonstrated high accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, especially for CWE-199, CWE-120, and CWE-Other. However, performance issues were noted due to the lack of a standardized dataset for some vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN approach outperforms traditional techniques, offering significant advancements in software vulnerability detection, and highlights the need for standardized datasets for future improvement.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on software in various applications has made the problem of software vulnerability detection more critical. Software vulnerabilities can lead to security breaches, data theft, and other negative outcomes. Traditional software vulnerability detection techniques, such as static and dynamic analysis, have been shown to be ineffective at detecting multiple vulnerabilities.
  To address this issue, this study employed a deep learning approach, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to solve the software vulnerability detection problem. A 5-split cross-validation approach was used to train and evaluate the CNN model, which takes tokenized source code as input.
  The findings indicated that Sherlock successfully detected multiple vulnerabilities at the function level, and its performance was particularly strong for CWE-199, CWE-120, and CWE-Other, with an overall high accuracy rate and significant true positive and true negative values. However, the performance was less reliable for some vulnerabilities due to the lack of a standardized dataset which will be a future research direction. The results suggest that compared to current techniques, the proposed deep learning approach has the potential to substantially enhance the accuracy of software vulnerability detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empower educators to assess and refine their courses by understanding the current state of software engineering higher education.

Method: A crowd-sourced analysis of 207 university courses from 10 Dutch universities, using SWEBOK knowledge areas as a framework, refined through consistency improvement phases.

Result: A mapping of knowledge area coverage, clusters identified in course topics, and recognition of underrepresented areas like software engineering economics.

Conclusion: Dutch universities provide consistent coverage of knowledge areas, highlighting correlations for integrated learning while identifying gaps for potential curriculum enhancement.

Abstract: Software engineering educators strive to continuously improve their courses and programs. Understanding the current state of practice of software engineering higher education can empower educators to critically assess their courses, fine-tune them by benchmarking against observed practices, and ultimately enhance their curricula. In this study, we aim to provide an encompassing analysis of higher education on software engineering by considering the higher educational offering of an entire European country, namely the Netherlands. We leverage a crowd-sourced analysis process by considering 10 Dutch universities and 207 university courses. The courses are analysed via knowledge areas adopted from the SWEBOK. The mapping process is refined via homogenisation and internal consistency improvement phases, and is followed by a data analysis phase. Given its fundamental nature, Construction and Programming is the most covered knowledge area at Bachelor level. Other knowledge areas are equally covered at Bachelor and Master level (e.g., software engineering models), while more advanced ones are almost exclusively covered at Master level. We identify three clusters of tightly coupled knowledge areas: (i) requirements, architecture, and design, (ii) testing, verification, and security, and (iii) process-oriented and DevOps topics. Dutch universities generally cover all knowledge areas uniformly, with minor deviations reflecting institutional research strengths. Our results highlight correlations among key knowledge areas and their potential for enhancing integrated learning. We also identify underrepresented areas, such as software engineering economics, which educators may consider including in curricula. We invite researchers to use our research method in their own geographical region, in order to contrast software engineering education programs across the globe.

Result: The seven attributes were deemed important for industry-oriented research. Practical feedback suggested refinements like considering financial criteria (ROI) and addressing feasibility under evidence.

Conclusion: The seven attributes support effective problem formulation by aligning academic research with industry needs, but their application should be tailored to specific research contexts.

Abstract: [Background] A well-formulated research problem is essential for achieving practical relevance in Software Engineering (SE), yet there is a lack of structured guidance in this early phase. [Aims] Our goal is to introduce and evaluate seven attributes identified in the SE literature as relevant for formulating research problems (practical problem, context, implications/impacts, practitioners, evidence, objective, and research questions) in terms of their perceived importance and completeness, and learn how they can be applied. [Method] We conducted a workshop with 42 senior SE researchers during the ISERN 2024 meeting. The seven attributes were presented using a Problem Vision board filled with a research example. Participants discussed attributes in groups, shared written feedback, and individually completed a survey assessing their importance, completeness, and suggestions for improvement. [Results] The findings confirm the importance of the seven attributes in the formulation of industry-oriented research problems. Qualitative feedback illustrated how they can be applied in practice and revealed suggestions to refine them, such as incorporating financial criteria (e.g., ROI) into implications/impacts and addressing feasibility and constraints under evidence. [Conclusion] The results reaffirm the importance of the seven attributes in supporting a reflective and context-aware problem formulation. Adapting their use to specific research contexts can help to improve the alignment between academic research and industry needs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research problems in software engineering often fail to capture the complexity of real-world practice, reducing their practical impact. The paper seeks to address this gap by exploring AI-assisted approaches to improve problem formulation.

Method: The authors use the Lean Research Inception framework and a published study on machine learning maintainability to evaluate an AI-based approach. They propose scenarios where AI agents help by aligning stakeholder views, refining questions, and simulating assessments.

Result: The descriptive evaluation suggests that AI agents can enrich collaboration, critical reflection, and decision-making in the research problem formulation process by enhancing context-aware and practice-oriented methods.

Conclusion: The integration of AI agents into problem formulation appears promising for improving relevance and feasibility in SE studies. However, further empirical validation is necessary to fine-tune this integration.

Abstract: Poorly formulated research problems can compromise the practical relevance of Software Engineering studies by not reflecting the complexities of industrial practice. This vision paper explores the use of artificial intelligence agents to support SE researchers during the early stage of a research project, the formulation of the research problem. Based on the Lean Research Inception framework and using a published study on code maintainability in machine learning as a reference, we developed a descriptive evaluation of a scenario illustrating how AI agents, integrated into LRI, can support SE researchers by pre filling problem attributes, aligning stakeholder perspectives, refining research questions, simulating multiperspective assessments, and supporting decision making. The descriptive evaluation of the scenario suggests that AI agent support can enrich collaborative discussions and enhance critical reflection on the value, feasibility, and applicability of the research problem. Although the vision of integrating AI agents into LRI was perceived as promising to support the context aware and practice oriented formulation of research problems, empirical validation is needed to confirm and refine the integration of AI agents into problem formulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient middle-ground method for verifying correctness properties in embedded software, balancing low-cost methods like static analysis and complex formal methods.

Method: Introduction of Temporal HAL-API Dependencies (THADs) using program annotations for specification and software model checking for verification.

Result: THADs may simplify and encourage the adoption of formal methods in industrial embedded software development by offering an economic and practical solution.

Conclusion: THADs present a promising approach for balancing effort, cost, and reliability in verifying embedded software correctness, potentially increasing formal method usage in the industry.

Abstract: Temporal HAL-API Dependencies (THADs) can be useful to capture an interesting class of correctness properties in embedded software development. They demand a moderate effort for specification (which can be done via program annotations) and verification (which can be done automatically via software model checking). In this sense, they have the potential to form an interesting sweet spot between generic properties (that demand virtually no specification effort, and that are typically addressed by static analysis) and application-specific properties as addressed by full-fledged formal methods. Thus, they may form a gateway to wider and more economic use of formal methods in industrial embedded software development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the shift to remote and hybrid work environments in the technology sector, presenting unique opportunities and challenges for the inclusion of people with disabilities in software development teams.

Method: The study used a mixed-methods approach, including an online survey with PWD, leaders, and teammates, along with 14 structured interviews of disabled software developers (autistic, physically disabled, and d/Deaf individuals). Quantitative data and qualitative coding were analyzed.

Result: Findings reveal that while PWD encounter barriers in remote collaboration, their teammates and leaders are often unaware of the daily challenges, indicating a gap in understanding and inclusivity.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for improved accessibility tools, communication strategies, and better management approaches to enhance collaboration for PWD in remote software development teams.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of remote and hybrid work modalities in the technology sector has brought new opportunities and challenges for the inclusion of people with disabilities (PWD) in software development teams (SDT). This study investigates how remote work affects PWDs' experience in mixed-ability SDT, focusing on the unique challenges and strategies that emerge in remote environments. We conducted an online survey with \totalSurveyResponses valid responses, encompassing PWD, their leaders, and teammates, to capture sociotechnical aspects of their experiences with remote collaboration. To deepen our understanding, we carried out 14 structured interviews with software developers who self-identified as having disabilities (six autistic individuals, six with physical disabilities, and two who are d/Deaf). Our analysis combines quantitative data with qualitative coding of open-ended survey responses and interview transcripts. The results reveal that, despite the barriers faced by team members with disabilities, their teammates and leaders have a limited perception of the daily challenges involved in sustaining collaborative remote work. These findings highlight opportunities for improvement in accessibility tools, communication strategies, and adaptive management approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of selecting blockchain patterns due to their diversity and the absence of standardized frameworks linking business goals to technical design decisions.

Method: Proposed the BC-TEAEM framework that uses ontologies of blockchain patterns and soft goals combined with a multi-criteria decision-making approach. Developed a prototype decision support tool and validated it with a pharmaceutical supply chain case study.

Result: The framework enabled systematic selection of blockchain patterns, ensuring alignment between domain experts and technical experts, demonstrated in a pharmaceutical company's supply chain scenario.

Conclusion: BC-TEAEM facilitates robust decision-making by aligning business and technical aspects, supporting traceable and systematic blockchain pattern selection.

Abstract: Blockchain technology is gaining momentum across many sectors. Whereas blockchain solutions have important positive effects on the business domain, they also introduce constraints and may cause delayed or unforeseen negative effects, undermining business strategies. The diversity of blockchain patterns and lack of standardized frameworks linking business goals to technical design decisions make pattern selection a complex task for system architects. To address this challenge, we propose Blockchain--Technology-Aware Enterprise Modeling (BC-TEAEM), a decision support framework that combines ontologies of blockchain patterns and domain-independent soft goals with a multi-criteria decision-making approach. The framework focuses on the interplay between a domain expert and a technical expert to ensure alignment and traceability. By iteratively capturing and refining preferences, BC-TEAEM supports systematic selection of blockchain patterns. We develop a prototype decision support tool implementing our method and validate it through a case study of a pharmaceutical company's supply chain traceability system, demonstrating the framework's applicability. %a supply chain traceability case study.

*Shuyuan Xiao,Yiran Zhang,Weisong Sun,Xiaohong Chen,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces code-aligned use case benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in generating use cases from source code and reveals key limitations in LLM reverse engineering capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of benchmarks for functional requirements (use cases) specification that align with real system behavior, which limits accurate evaluation of LLMs in reverse engineering use cases from code.

Method: The authors constructed benchmarks manually validated across nine software projects and conducted systematic studies of LLMs using a hierarchical evaluation protocol assessing various aspects such as actor correctness and behavioral coverage.

Result: The study found that LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionalities but exhibit high variation in performance, with major challenges in domain-specific and multi-module systems, as well as issues with omissions and abstraction consistency.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate potential for use case reverse engineering, yet face significant challenges in fidelity, coverage, and handling complex systems effectively.

Abstract: Use cases are widely employed to specify functional requirements, yet existing benchmarks are scarce and face the risk of being misaligned with actual system behavior, similarly limiting the rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in generating use cases from source code. We address this gap by introducing code-aligned use case benchmarks, constructed through manual validation of both user-goal and subfunction use cases across nine real-world software projects. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first systematic study of LLMs and propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that assesses actor correctness, name accuracy, path fidelity, and behavioral coverage. The results show that while LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionality, their performance varies significantly across projects, with particularly noticeable shortcomings in domain-specific and multi-module systems. The models also exhibit high omission rates and struggle to maintain consistent abstraction when aggregating subfunctions into user-goal use cases, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of LLM-based use case reverse engineering.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSALM, an adaptation of the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) for metamorphic testing (MT), offering improvements in source test case and metamorphic group (MG) selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection in MT, which are critical for fault detection, complementing the focus on designing and validating metamorphic relations (MRs).

Method: The authors adapted PSS to MT, accounting for test case and MG selection specifics. They theoretically analyzed PSALM's effectiveness compared to random selection and explored conditions where PSALM excels.

Result: Theoretical proofs and empirical studies on 8 programs and 184 mutants confirmed PSALM's superior effectiveness over random selection and techniques like ART and MT-ART.

Conclusion: PSALM provides a robust, theoretically grounded, and effective strategy for test case and MG selection, enhancing MT's efficacy.

Abstract: Metamorphic testing (MT) alleviates the oracle problem by checking metamorphic relations (MRs) across multiple test executions. The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.

*Ning Ma,Jianjun Zhao,Foutse Khomh,Shaukat Ali,Heng Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: QMON is a methodology for monitoring quantum circuits using mid-circuit measurements and resets without disrupting their functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuits are challenging to monitor due to properties like no-cloning and measurement-induced collapse, making debugging and runtime monitoring difficult.

Method: QMON uses mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to instrument monitoring operators at specified locations without disrupting runtime behavior.

Result: QMON successfully detects and localizes programming errors with negligible disturbance to quantum states, evaluated on 154 circuits.

Conclusion: QMON enhances debugging and monitoring of quantum circuits, aiding the development of reliable quantum software.

Abstract: Unlike classical software, where logging and runtime tracing can effectively reveal internal execution status, quantum circuits possess unique properties, such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement-induced collapse, that prevent direct observation or duplication of their states. These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.

TL;DR: UIFormer optimizes UI representation in LLM agents to overcome efficiency bottlenecks, achieving significant token reduction and maintaining or improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face performance bottlenecks due to inefficient UI representation, limiting their potential in areas like automated UI testing and AI assistants.

Method: UIFormer uses a domain-specific language to restrict program space and applies LLM-based iterative refinement guided by correctness and efficiency rewards for synthesis optimization.

Result: Testing on Android and Web UI navigation benchmarks with multiple LLMs showed token reduction between 48.7% and 55.8% without runtime overhead, and industry deployment further confirmed practical benefits.

Conclusion: UIFormer enhances efficiency and usability in UI navigation tasks, validating its contributions in both academic benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic.

*Yi Peng,Hina Saeeda,Hans-Martin Heyn,Jennifer Horkoff,Eric Knauss,Fredrick Warg*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DARS framework to address challenges in data annotation requirements for AI-enabled systems, showing its effectiveness in mitigating annotation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distinct challenges in data annotation requirements for AI-based systems, which current RE methods do not adequately capture.

Method: Development of the DARS framework, featuring an Annotation Negotiation Card and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification, which were evaluated using an automotive perception case and 18 real-world annotation error types.

Result: DARS successfully mitigated the root causes of incompleteness, inaccuracy, and inconsistency in data annotations, proving its benefit in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: Integrating DARS improves the reliability of AI systems by addressing critical data annotation challenges, highlighting the need for refined engineering frameworks for data-reliant systems.

Abstract: With the rise of AI-enabled cyber-physical systems, data annotation has become a critical yet often overlooked process in the development of these intelligent information systems. Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.

Motivation: The ICT sector has a growing impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, which needs to be addressed to meet climate goals such as those set by the Paris Agreement.

Method: The study employs system mapping to identify sources of carbon emissions, energy consumption, and stakeholder responsibilities within the software lifecycle.

Result: The mapping successfully highlights primary emission sources and energy consumption areas tied to the ICT sector, pinpointing stakeholder duties in mitigating environmental impact.

Conclusion: Addressing ICT-related emissions through comprehensive mapping reinforces the urgency for targeted interventions, aiding progress toward climate goals and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: The global climate is experiencing a rapid and unprecedented warming trend. The ICT sector is a notable contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, with its environmental impact continuing to expand. Addressing this issue is vital for achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, particularly the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for automated SQL-based system migration using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, validated through experimental outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, while optimizing database transformation processes.

Method: The framework combines fine-tuning of Large Language Models, prompt engineering, and innovations like automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis, and Subject Matter Experts feedback.

Result: The study achieves reductions in Syntax Error Rates, improved feature alignment during migration, and enhanced database transformations through precise mapping and data-driven loops.

Conclusion: The integration of fine-tuned Large Language Models and iterative methodologies significantly improves automated codebase migration workflow efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.

*Kishan Kumar Ganguly,Tim Menzies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that extensive datasets and powerful optimizers are needed for software engineering tasks. It shows that lightweight methods can achieve nearly the same results as state-of-the-art techniques with fewer labels and lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption in software engineering research that massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers are crucial for progress and explore alternatives that may be faster and more cost-effective.

Method: Counter-evidence from dozens of software engineering optimization problems using lightweight methods like diversity sampling, minimal Bayesian learners, or random probes. Formalized labeling, baseline algorithms, and studies on public data are presented.

Result: Lightweight methods with minimal labeling achieve near 90% of the best-reported results across various SE tasks, performing comparable to state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: Lightweight approaches may suffice for numerous engineering needs, providing rapid and cost-efficient outcomes. Researchers are encouraged to investigate when fewer labels and less computation are adequate for SE tasks.

Abstract: Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested?
  The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization).
  Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

*Bichan Wu,Jonathan Pillow*

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) and its applications in neuroscience to study neural communication subspaces, providing a tutorial-like overview of its methods, extensions, and practical metrics for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a comprehensive and foundational understanding of Reduced Rank Regression (RRR), particularly emphasizing its role in analyzing neural communication and bridging it to other dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: The paper introduces RRR, explaining its mathematical foundation, its relation to other techniques like PCA, SVD, PCR, and CCA, and provides extensions such as ridge regularization and handling non-spherical noise. It also suggests new metrics to evaluate neural communication.

Result: The tutorial offers both theoretical insights and practical extensions, introducing novel metrics that allow for quantifying neural communication and its alignment with principal activity modes.

Conclusion: By the end of the paper, readers are equipped with a clear understanding of RRR, its applications in neuroscience, and practical considerations for implementing it in their own datasets.

Abstract: Reduced rank regression (RRR) is a statistical method for finding a low-dimensional linear mapping between a set of high-dimensional inputs and outputs. In recent years, RRR has found numerous applications in neuroscience, in particular for identifying "communication subspaces" governing the interactions between brain regions. This tutorial article seeks to provide an introduction to RRR and its mathematical foundations, with a particular emphasis on neural communication. We discuss RRR's relationship to alternate dimensionality reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), principal components analysis (PCA), principal components regression (PCR), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We also derive important extensions to RRR, including ridge regularization and non-spherical noise. Finally, we introduce new metrics for quantifying communication strength as well as the alignment between communication axes and the principal modes of neural activity. By the end of this article, readers should have a clear understanding of RRR and the practical considerations involved in applying it to their own data.

*Thiparat Chotibut,Oleg Evnin,Weerawit Horinouchi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the matrix characteristics and dynamics near equilibria in trained recurrent neuron networks and develops a theoretical framework to relate statistical properties to robust memory computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how characteristics of trained recurrent neuron networks contribute to shaping dynamical properties beneficial for tasks like working memory.

Method: Analyzed Jacobian matrices near equilibria, proposed a random matrix ensemble capturing their spectra, and developed an analytic theory using statistical field theory and supersymmetry-based approaches.

Result: Found that Jacobian matrices are sparse, modified by variable synaptic timescales and gains, and derived an analytic description connecting these features to the stability of near-critical equilibria.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the link between synaptic properties and network dynamics, enhancing understanding of memory computation in trained neuronal networks.

Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.

### [618] [A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness: The Necessity of Continual Learning for Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12802)
*Erik Hoel*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper uses formal arguments to critically assess the consciousness of Large Language Models (LLMs), concluding that contemporary LLMs cannot be considered conscious due to their lack of continual learning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore requirements and constraints for a falsifiable, non-trivial theory of consciousness, particularly in relation to modern Large Language Models.

Method: The study employs formal analytical tools like the Unfolding, Substitution, and a new Proximity Argument to systematically evaluate the consciousness of LLMs. It also compares theories requiring continual learning to the constraints for consciousness in humans.

Result: The result establishes that contemporary Large Language Models cannot satisfy the criteria for consciousness due to their functional equivalence to input/output systems where no non-trivial consciousness theories apply.

Conclusion: The analysis suggests continual learning is a key factor for consciousness, thereby highlighting why LLMs without such capability likely lack conscious phenomena.

Abstract: The requirements for a falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness significantly constrain such theories. Specifically, recent research on the Unfolding Argument and the Substitution Argument has given us formal tools to analyze requirements for a theory of consciousness. I show via a new Proximity Argument that these requirements especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.

TL;DR: Macular is a simulation platform for building and testing retina and primary visual system models with a user-friendly graphical interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a tool for neurobiologists and modelers to simulate and test hypotheses about the retina and visual system without requiring programming expertise.

Method: The platform allows users to design three-dimensional structures representing retinal cells and layers, customize equations for cellular behavior, and simulate input video data with a graphical interface. It generates C++ code automatically for simulations.

Result: Macular successfully enables users to simulate various scenarios, including published retino-cortical models, without needing advanced programming skills.

Conclusion: Macular is a beneficial tool for visual system researchers, offering a straightforward way to perform in silico experiments under both normal and altered conditions.

Abstract: We developed Macular, a simulation platform with a graphical interface, designed to produce in silico experiment scenarios for the retina and the primary visual system. A scenario consists of generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of 'cell' in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). The inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software, or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows natural or altered conditions (pharmacology, pathology, development) to be simulated.

*Raymond Khazoum,Daniela Fernandes,Aleksandr Krylov,Qin Li,Stephane Deny*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computational model for human mental rotation using deep learning, equivariant methods, and neuro-symbolic techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and modeling the cognitive process of human mental rotation, a vital element of spatial reasoning.

Method: The model uses three components: an equivariant neural encoder, a neuro-symbolic object encoder, and a neural decision agent. It incorporates insights from VR experiments and human cognitive studies.

Result: The model accurately reproduces human performance, response times, and behavior in mental rotation tasks, validated through systematic ablations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the effectiveness of merging deep learning, equivariant representations, and neuro-symbolic approaches to simulate human spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Mental rotation -- the ability to compare objects seen from different viewpoints -- is a fundamental example of mental simulation and spatial world modelling in humans. Here we propose a mechanistic model of human mental rotation, leveraging advances in deep, equivariant, and neuro-symbolic learning. Our model consists of three stacked components: (1) an equivariant neural encoder, taking images as input and producing 3D spatial representations of objects, (2) a neuro-symbolic object encoder, deriving symbolic descriptions of objects from these spatial representations, and (3) a neural decision agent, comparing these symbolic descriptions to prescribe rotation simulations in 3D latent space via a recurrent pathway. Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation. Our model captures well the performance, response times and behavior of participants in our and others' experiments. The necessity of each model component is shown through systematic ablations. Our work adds to a recent collection of deep neural models of human spatial reasoning, further demonstrating the potency of integrating deep, equivariant, and symbolic representations to model the human mind.

*Saghar Vosough,Gian Candrian,Johannes Kasper,Hossam Abdel Rehim,Dominique Eich,Andreas Mueller,Lutz Jäncke*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores ADHD-related impairments in executive functions and emotion processing through network-based EEG analysis, finding subtle differences in brain network activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the large-scale neural dynamics underlying executive dysfunction and emotional facial processing difficulties in ADHD, which remain poorly understood.

Method: Analyzed EEG data from 272 participants using source-based methods (e.g., eLORETA and ICA) during Go/NoGo cognitive and emotional tasks, with statistical analyses examining task and group differences.

Result: Found minor but significant increases in network activation in ADHD participants, notably in gamma and delta frequency components, with established behavioral differences in inhibitory control repeated in tasks.

Conclusion: ADHD involves subtle neural network alterations with limited EEG-based diagnostic potential, supporting the idea of ADHD as a spectrum disorder with high within-group variability.

Abstract: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by executive dysfunction and difficulties in processing emotional facial expressions, yet the large-scale neural dynamics underlying these impairments remain insufficiently understood. This study applied network-based EEG source analysis to examine oscillatory cortical activity during cognitive and emotional Go/NoGo tasks in individuals with ADHD. EEG data from 272 participants (ADHD n equals 102, controls n equals 170, age range 6 to 60 years) were analyzed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography combined with functional independent component analysis, yielding ten frequency-resolved cortical networks. Mixed-effects ANCOVAs were conducted on independent component loadings with Group, Task, and Condition as factors and age and sex as covariates. ADHD participants showed statistically significant but small increases in activation across several networks, including a gamma-dominant inferior temporal component showing a Group effect and a Group by Condition interaction with stronger NoGo-related activation in ADHD. Two additional components showed similar but weaker NoGo-selective patterns. A main effect of Task emerged only for one temporal delta component, with higher activation during the VCPT than the ECPT. No Group by Task interactions were observed. Behavioral results replicated the established ADHD performance profile, with slower responses, greater variability, and higher error rates, particularly during the emotional ECPT. Overall, the findings reveal subtle alterations in oscillatory brain networks during inhibitory processing in ADHD, with modest effect sizes embedded within substantial within-group variability. These results support a dimensional view of ADHD neurobiology and highlight the limited discriminative power of network-level EEG markers.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends the framework of Fisher's Discriminant Analysis to interval-valued data, using interval arithmetic and advanced distance measures. It introduces visualization tools to assess classifier performance in this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard data analysis methods often fail to capture internal variability within entities. This paper seeks to address this limitation by extending classification methods to interval-valued data.

Method: The authors propose a generalisation of Fisher's Discriminant Analysis for interval-valued data, employing Moore's interval arithmetic and Mallows' distance. They develop new graphical tools such as an adapted class map and silhouette plot for visual evaluation.

Result: The extended Fisher's Discriminant Analysis effectively classifies interval-valued data, supported by visualization tools that aid in assessing classifier performance and interpreting class membership.

Conclusion: The paper's methodology successfully enhances classification and visualization for interval-valued data, proving useful in applications to real datasets.

Abstract: In Data Science, entities are typically represented by single valued measurements. Symbolic Data Analysis extends this framework to more complex structures, such as intervals and histograms, that express internal variability. We propose an extension of multiclass Fisher's Discriminant Analysis to interval-valued data, using Moore's interval arithmetic and the Mallows' distance. Fisher's objective function is generalised to consider simultaneously the contributions of the centres and the ranges of intervals and is numerically maximised. The resulting discriminant directions are then used to classify interval-valued observations.To support visual assessment, we adapt the class map, originally introduced for conventional data, to classifiers that assign labels through minimum distance rules. We also extend the silhouette plot to this setting and use stacked mosaic plots to complement the visual display of class assignments. Together, these graphical tools provide insight into classifier performance and the strength of class membership. Applications to real datasets illustrate the proposed methodology and demonstrate its value in interpreting classification results for interval-valued data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hellinger-type loss functions for GAN training, emphasizing properties like boundedness and robustness. It explores statistical properties and demonstrates improved performance over classic GAN losses in handling data contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve estimation accuracy and robustness in training GANs, especially under data contamination, by leveraging the advantages of the Hellinger distance.

Method: The authors define an adversarial objective based on the Hellinger distance, analyze its statistical properties, and evaluate two implementations through simulations comparing with classic GAN losses.

Result: The proposed loss functions demonstrate improved estimation accuracy and robustness compared to classic GAN loss, particularly when data contamination increases.

Conclusion: Hellinger-type loss functions offer a statistically sound and empirically robust alternative for GAN training, addressing limitations of traditional losses.

Abstract: We propose Hellinger-type loss functions for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), motivated by the boundedness, symmetry, and robustness properties of the Hellinger distance. We define an adversarial objective based on this divergence and study its statistical properties within a general parametric framework. We establish the existence, uniqueness, consistency, and joint asymptotic normality of the estimators obtained from the adversarial training procedure. In particular, we analyze the joint estimation of both generator and discriminator parameters, offering a comprehensive asymptotic characterization of the resulting estimators. We introduce two implementations of the Hellinger-type loss and we evaluate their empirical behavior in comparison with the classic (Maximum Likelihood-type) GAN loss. Through a controlled simulation study, we demonstrate that both proposed losses yield improved estimation accuracy and robustness under increasing levels of data contamination.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating mutual information for continuous random variables is challenging and existing methods have limitations in bias and variance.

Method: The authors use a supervised deep-learning model, trained with ground truth labels for mutual information derived from Gaussian and Clayton copulas.

Result: The proposed method achieves lower bias and variance compared to kernel density estimators, k-nearest neighbor estimators, and other neural estimators.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for estimating mutual information, and future research could extend it by incorporating diverse examples from other copula families.

Abstract: We develop a supervised deep-learning approach to estimate mutual information between two continuous random variables. As labels, we use the Linfoot informational correlation, a transformation of mutual information that has many important properties. Our method is based on ground truth labels for Gaussian and Clayton copulas. We compare our method with estimators based on kernel density, k-nearest neighbours and neural estimators. We show generally lower bias and lower variance.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying multiple closely related multiview graphs with shared structures using a co-hub node model and structured sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that assume data is uniform and focus on single graph structures, despite the heterogeneity in real-world datasets often including related multiview graphs.

Method: A co-hub node model is introduced, enforcing structured sparsity on shared hub nodes across views. Theoretical analysis on identifiability and estimation bounds is presented, with validations conducted using synthetic and fMRI data.

Result: The method successfully identifies shared hub nodes and closely related graphs in synthetic and fMRI data, showing improved precision and interpretability.

Conclusion: The co-hub node model enhances multiview graph learning by leveraging shared hub structures, providing theoretical insights and practical validation for improved graph analysis.

Abstract: Identifying the graphical structure underlying the observed multivariate data is essential in numerous applications. Current methodologies are predominantly confined to deducing a singular graph under the presumption that the observed data are uniform. However, many contexts involve heterogeneous datasets that feature multiple closely related graphs, typically referred to as multiview graphs. Previous research on multiview graph learning promotes edge-based similarity across layers using pairwise or consensus-based regularizers. However, multiview graphs frequently exhibit a shared node-based architecture across different views, such as common hub nodes. Such commonalities can enhance the precision of learning and provide interpretive insight. In this paper, we propose a co-hub node model, positing that different views share a common group of hub nodes. The associated optimization framework is developed by enforcing structured sparsity on the connections of these co-hub nodes. Moreover, we present a theoretical examination of layer identifiability and determine bounds on estimation error. The proposed methodology is validated using both synthetic graph data and fMRI time series data from multiple subjects to discern several closely related graphs.

### [626] [Efficient Level-Crossing Probability Calculation for Gaussian Process Modeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12442)
*Haoyu Li,Isaac J Michaud,Ayan Biswas,Han-Wei Shen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance the efficiency of level-crossing probability calculations in Gaussian process regression (GPR) models by using hierarchical data structures and novel bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPR models are ideal for Gaussian-distributed uncertainty data and reduce I/O bandwidth but have high computational demands, particularly for visualization techniques like probabilistic marching cubes on high-resolution data.

Method: The method involves spatial subdivision of data into a hierarchical structure and adaptive reconstruction in regions with non-zero probability, coupled with novel upper-bound calculations for level-crossing probabilities using known GPR kernels.

Result: The proposed method proves to be computationally efficient and accurate in estimating level-crossing probability fields, as evidenced by experiments on various datasets.

Conclusion: This approach successfully addresses the computational inefficiencies in conventional methods, enabling faster and accurate calculations of probability fields for GPR models, even with high-resolution data.

Abstract: Almost all scientific data have uncertainties originating from different sources. Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are a natural way to model data with Gaussian-distributed uncertainties. GPR also has the benefit of reducing I/O bandwidth and storage requirements for large scientific simulations. However, the reconstruction from the GPR models suffers from high computation complexity. To make the situation worse, classic approaches for visualizing the data uncertainties, like probabilistic marching cubes, are also computationally very expensive, especially for data of high resolutions. In this paper, we accelerate the level-crossing probability calculation efficiency on GPR models by subdividing the data spatially into a hierarchical data structure and only reconstructing values adaptively in the regions that have a non-zero probability. For each region, leveraging the known GPR kernel and the saved data observations, we propose a novel approach to efficiently calculate an upper bound for the level-crossing probability inside the region and use this upper bound to make the subdivision and reconstruction decisions. We demonstrate that our value occurrence probability estimation is accurate with a low computation cost by experiments that calculate the level-crossing probability fields on different datasets.

TL;DR: This paper explores the manifestation of double-descent in survival analysis using four survival models, and highlights differences in generalization through theoretical proofs and numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double-descent behavior has been studied extensively in regression and classification tasks but not yet in survival analysis. Understanding this phenomenon in survival models is crucial for model optimization and identifying overfitting risks.

Method: The study rigorously defines interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, applies these to four survival models (DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR), and examines their loss behaviors both theoretically and numerically.

Result: The paper demonstrates the (in)existence of interpolation and finite-norm interpolation in survival models, emphasizing how likelihood-based losses and implementations impact generalization behaviors.

Conclusion: Double-descent exists in survival models under specific conditions, but overfitting should not be considered benign. These insights can aid in better survival model design and understanding generalization nuances.

Abstract: Classical statistical learning theory predicts a U-shaped relationship between test loss and model capacity, driven by the bias-variance trade-off. Recent advances in modern machine learning have revealed a more complex pattern, double-descent, in which test loss, after peaking near the interpolation threshold, decreases again as model capacity continues to grow. While this behavior has been extensively analyzed in regression and classification, its manifestation in survival analysis remains unexplored. This study investigates double-descent in four representative survival models: DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR. We rigorously define interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, two key characteristics of loss-based models to understand double-descent. We then show the existence (or absence) of (finite-norm) interpolation of all four models. Our findings clarify how likelihood-based losses and model implementation jointly determine the feasibility of interpolation and show that overfitting should not be regarded as benign for survival models. All theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments that highlight the distinct generalization behaviors of survival models.

*Jie Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops primal-focused algorithms for solving Sinkhorn DRO, enhancing decision-making under uncertainty by simultaneously obtaining robust decisions and worst-case distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in theoretical analyses of dual-based stochastic methods for Sinkhorn DRO and address the gap in obtaining worst-case distributions.

Method: Sinkhorn DRO is reformulated as a bilevel optimization problem, which is solved using double-loop and single-loop sampling-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees.

Result: The paper provides algorithms capable of both robust decision-making and identifying worst-case distributions, applied successfully to adversarial classification.

Conclusion: The primal approach enhances practical applicability of Sinkhorn DRO by improving robust learning and enabling stress-testing scenarios through worst-case distribution analysis.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reliable decision-making under uncertainty. This paper focuses on DRO with ambiguity sets defined via the Sinkhorn discrepancy: an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, referred to as Sinkhorn DRO. Existing work primarily addresses Sinkhorn DRO from a dual perspective, leveraging its formulation as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, for which many stochastic gradient methods are applicable. However, the theoretical analyses of such methods often rely on the boundedness of the loss function, and it is indirect to obtain the worst-case distribution associated with Sinkhorn DRO. In contrast, we study Sinkhorn DRO from the primal perspective, by reformulating it as a bilevel program with several infinite-dimensional lower-level subproblems over probability space. This formulation enables us to simultaneously obtain the optimal robust decision and the worst-case distribution, which is valuable in practical settings, such as generating stress-test scenarios or designing robust learning algorithms. We propose both double-loop and single-loop sampling-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve this bilevel program. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a numerical study on adversarial classification.

### [629] [Mind the Jumps: A Scalable Robust Local Gaussian Process for Multidimensional Response Surfaces with Discontinuities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12574)
*Isaac Adjetey,Yiyuan She*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Robust Local Gaussian Process (RLGP) model for handling abrupt jumps and discontinuities in modeling response surfaces. RLGP addresses limitations in existing methods like boundary inconsistencies and outlier sensitivity while boosting predictive accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian process models struggle with abrupt variations and nonstationary features. Current nonstationary extensions face issues like boundary inconsistencies, sensitivity to outliers, and limited scalability in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The RLGP model utilizes adaptive nearest-neighbor selection, sparsity-driven robustification, optimization-based mean-shift adjustment, and local neighborhood modeling, designed to manage outliers and improve predictions near discontinuities.

Result: RLGP shows superior predictive accuracy on real-world datasets, especially in transitioning or discontinuous data. The model is computationally competitive and stable in high-dimensional scenarios where other methods fail.

Conclusion: RLGP is a robust and effective tool for nonstationary and discontinuous response surface modeling, addressing critical challenges in predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency across diverse applications.

Abstract: Modeling response surfaces with abrupt jumps and discontinuities remains a major challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Although Gaussian process models excel at capturing smooth nonlinear relationships, their stationarity assumptions limit their ability to adapt to sudden input-output variations. Existing nonstationary extensions, particularly those based on domain partitioning, often struggle with boundary inconsistencies, sensitivity to outliers, and scalability issues in higher-dimensional settings, leading to reduced predictive accuracy and unreliable parameter estimation.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Robust Local Gaussian Process (RLGP) model, a framework that integrates adaptive nearest-neighbor selection with a sparsity-driven robustification mechanism. Unlike existing methods, RLGP leverages an optimization-based mean-shift adjustment after a multivariate perspective transformation combined with local neighborhood modeling to mitigate the influence of outliers. This approach improves predictive accuracy near discontinuities while enhancing robustness to data heterogeneity.
  Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that RLGP consistently delivers high predictive accuracy and maintains competitive computational efficiency, especially in scenarios with sharp transitions and complex response structures. Scalability tests further confirm RLGP's stability and reliability in higher-dimensional settings, where other methods struggle. These results establish RLGP as an effective and practical solution for modeling nonstationary and discontinuous response surfaces across a wide range of applications.

*Zhimin Chen,Bryan Kelly,Semyon Malamud*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Limits-to-Learning Gap (LLG), a lower bound on the discrepancy between models' empirical performance and true population benchmarks, highlighting its implications for financial predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of finite datasets constraining the ability of machine learning models to approximate true data-generating processes.

Method: Developed the theoretical framework for the Limits-to-Learning Gap (LLG) and applied it to financial variables to evaluate its impact on predictability and other economic models.

Result: Finds that the LLG is large in financial datasets, indicating an underestimation of true predictability; provides refinements to existing bounds like Hansen and Jagannathan (1991).

Conclusion: The study highlights inherent predictability limits due to finite data and emphasizes the need to incorporate LLG corrections to achieve accurate population-level insights.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods are highly flexible, but their ability to approximate the true data-generating process is fundamentally constrained by finite samples. We characterize a universal lower bound, the Limits-to-Learning Gap (LLG), quantifying the unavoidable discrepancy between a model's empirical fit and the population benchmark. Recovering the true population $R^2$, therefore, requires correcting observed predictive performance by this bound. Using a broad set of variables, including excess returns, yields, credit spreads, and valuation ratios, we find that the implied LLGs are large. This indicates that standard ML approaches can substantially understate true predictability in financial data. We also derive LLG-based refinements to the classic Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds, analyze implications for parameter learning in general-equilibrium settings, and show that the LLG provides a natural mechanism for generating excess volatility.

*Pingping Yin,Xiyun Jiao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using variational inference with normalizing flows (VI-NFs) to optimize proposals in reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), enabling more efficient trans-dimensional Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) due to reliance on costly sampling and ineffective mixing across models, using a novel variational inference-based method.

Method: The proposed framework employs variational inference with RealNVP-based normalizing flows to optimize model-specific transport maps, avoiding pilot sampling by minimizing reverse KL divergence. This facilitates efficient proposal generation both within and between models.

Result: Experiments on example tasks, including factor analysis and variable selection, show the method achieves faster mixing rates and improves model space exploration, outperforming current baselines.

Conclusion: The VI-NFs framework significantly enhances RJMCMC efficiency for trans-dimensional inference by improving model comparison and proposal adaptation, with potential for further extension into conditional flows for variational inference across models.

Abstract: We present a framework using variational inference with normalizing flows (VI-NFs) to generate proposals of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) for efficient trans-dimensional Bayesian inference. Unlike transport reversible jump methods relying on forward KL minimization with pilot MCMC samples, our approach minimizes the reverse KL divergence which requires only samples from a base distribution, eliminating costly target sampling. The method employs RealNVP-based flows to learn model-specific transport maps, enabling construction of both between-model and within-model proposals. Our framework provides accurate marginal likelihood estimates from the variational approximation. This facilitates efficient model comparison and proposal adaptation in RJMCMC. Experiments on illustrative example, factor analysis and variable selection tasks in linear regression show that TRJ designed by VI-NFs achieves faster mixing and more efficient model space exploration compared to existing baselines. The proposed algorithm can be extended to conditional flows for amortized vairiational inference across models. Code is available at https://github.com/YinPingping111/TRJ_VINFs.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the generalizability of multivariate linear regression and Linear Autoencoders (LAEs), providing theoretical insights, a PAC-Bayes bound, and practical methods to evaluate its bounds. Results show tight correlation with ranking metrics like Recall@K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding behind the empirical success of Linear Autoencoders (LAEs) in recommender systems.

Method: The authors derive a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extend it to adapt LAEs under relaxed mean squared error, and develop methods for practical evaluation of bound optimization in large datasets.

Result: The derived bound is tight and demonstrates strong correlation with ranking metrics such as Recall@K and NDCG@K. Computational methods enable efficient evaluation of LAE bounds on large datasets.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights into LAEs' generalization properties are provided, demonstrating their relationship with multivariate linear regression and improving both understanding and practical evaluation.

Abstract: Linear Autoencoders (LAEs) have shown strong performance in state-of-the-art recommender systems. However, this success remains largely empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we investigate the generalizability -- a theoretical measure of model performance in statistical learning -- of multivariate linear regression and LAEs. We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to improve the computational efficiency of optimizing the LAE bound, enabling its practical evaluation on large models and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our bound is tight and correlates well with practical ranking metrics such as Recall@K and NDCG@K.

*Kohei Nishikawa,Koki Shimizu,Hashiguchi Hiroki*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of thresholds for removing singular values in low-rank approximations of deep neural network weight matrices, using a new cosine similarity-based metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve low-rank approximations of weight matrices in deep learning by effectively separating signal from noise, ensuring a more accurate representation.

Method: A low-rank approximation method is proposed where deep learning weight matrices are modeled as signal plus noise. Singular values associated with noise are removed using random matrix theory thresholds. A new cosine similarity-based metric is introduced to evaluate these thresholds.

Result: Numerical experiments were conducted with the proposed metric to compare two different threshold estimation methods.

Conclusion: The study identifies effective methods for thresholding singular values in weight matrices, contributing to better low-rank approximations in deep learning models.

Abstract: This study evaluates thresholds for removing singular values from singular value decomposition-based low-rank approximations of deep neural network weight matrices. Each weight matrix is modeled as the sum of signal and noise matrices. The low-rank approximation is obtained by removing noise-related singular values using a threshold based on random matrix theory. To assess the adequacy of this threshold, we propose an evaluation metric based on the cosine similarity between the singular vectors of the signal and original weight matrices. The proposed metric is used in numerical experiments to compare two threshold estimation methods.

### [634] [General OOD Detection via Model-aware and Subspace-aware Variable Priority](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13003)
*Min Lu,Hemant Ishwaran*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an OOD detection framework for regression and survival analysis, leveraging localized neighborhoods and variable prioritization using random forests, showing improved results in experiments and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited progress in OOD detection for regression and survival analysis, as these domains lack discrete labels and face challenges in quantifying predictive uncertainty.

Method: The framework constructs localized neighborhoods around each test case using a fitted predictor, prioritizing features driving the model's prediction while downweighting less relevant directions. It employs random forests for effective OOD scoring without requiring global distance metrics or feature density estimation.

Result: The framework demonstrated consistent improvements over existing methods in synthetic and real data benchmarks, and identified patterns relevant to surgical guidelines in a cancer survival study.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enables OOD detection across different outcome types, offering advancements in predictive insights and clinical applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for determining when a supervised model encounters inputs that differ meaningfully from its training distribution. While widely studied in classification, OOD detection for regression and survival analysis remains limited due to the absence of discrete labels and the challenge of quantifying predictive uncertainty. We introduce a framework for OOD detection that is simultaneously model aware and subspace aware, and that embeds variable prioritization directly into the detection step. The method uses the fitted predictor to construct localized neighborhoods around each test case that emphasize the features driving the model's learned relationship and downweight directions that are less relevant to prediction. It produces OOD scores without relying on global distance metrics or estimating the full feature density. The framework is applicable across outcome types, and in our implementation we use random forests, where the rule structure yields transparent neighborhoods and effective scoring. Experiments on synthetic and real data benchmarks designed to isolate functional shifts show consistent improvements over existing methods. We further demonstrate the approach in an esophageal cancer survival study, where distribution shifts related to lymphadenectomy identify patterns relevant to surgical guidelines.

### [635] [A Nonparametric Statistics Approach to Feature Selection in Deep Neural Networks with Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13565)
*Junye Du,Zhenghao Li,Zhutong Gu,Long Feng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a feature selection method using deep neural networks, achieving nonlinear selection consistency under certain sample size conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of feature selection where the target depends on an unknown, nonlinear function of relevant features.

Method: Feature selection is performed via neural networks reformulated as index models and using Stein's formula, with screening-and-selection mechanisms for high dimensions.

Result: The proposed method ensures selection consistency under specific sample size requirements (e.g., n = Ω(p^2) and n = Ω(s log p)).

Conclusion: The approach performs well in simulations and real-data analyses even with complex feature interactions, establishing strong theoretical guarantees for feature selection and prediction.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of feature selection in a highly challenging setting: $\mathbb{E}(y | \boldsymbol{x}) = G(\boldsymbol{x}_{\mathcal{S}_0})$, where $\mathcal{S}_0$ is the set of relevant features and $G$ is an unknown, potentially nonlinear function subject to mild smoothness conditions. Our approach begins with feature selection in deep neural networks, then generalizes the results to H{ö}lder smooth functions by exploiting the strong approximation capabilities of neural networks. Unlike conventional optimization-based deep learning methods, we reformulate neural networks as index models and estimate $\mathcal{S}_0$ using the second-order Stein's formula. This gradient-descent-free strategy guarantees feature selection consistency with a sample size requirement of $n = Ω(p^2)$, where $p$ is the feature dimension. To handle high-dimensional scenarios, we further introduce a screening-and-selection mechanism that achieves nonlinear selection consistency when $n = Ω(s \log p)$, with $s$ representing the sparsity level. Additionally, we refit a neural network on the selected features for prediction and establish performance guarantees under a relaxed sparsity assumption. Extensive simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate the strong performance of our method even in the presence of complex feature interactions.

### [636] [Universality of high-dimensional scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13634)
*Reza Gheissari,Aukosh Jagannath*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies high-dimensional statistical tasks, specifically loss functions dependent on data projections, and shows universality in ODE limits under certain conditions, with some non-universality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand universality in the evolution of statistical tasks under stochastic gradient descent and its dependence on data distributions and initialization conditions.

Method: Analyzes data from mixtures of product measures with matched moments for Gaussian distributions, exploring ODE and SDE limits under stochastic gradient descent.

Result: Proves ODE universality for sufficiently delocalized initialization and ground truth vectors, while demonstrating non-universality in specific cases and SDE fluctuations.

Conclusion: The universality of ODE limits provides insights into high-dimensional statistical tasks under stochastic gradient descent, but certain initialization and fluctuation cases violate universality.

Abstract: We consider statistical tasks in high dimensions whose loss depends on the data only through its projection into a fixed-dimensional subspace spanned by the parameter vectors and certain ground truth vectors. This includes classifying mixture distributions with cross-entropy loss with one and two-layer networks, and learning single and multi-index models with one and two-layer networks. When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned. We also show that the stochastic differential equation limits arising as fluctuations of the summary statistics around their ODE's fixed points are not universal.

*Robin Vassantlal,Hasan Heydari,Bernardo Ferreira,Alysson Bessani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MVP-ORAM is proposed as a wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients without trusted proxies or distributed locks, addressing issues like Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ORAM protocols face challenges in supporting concurrent clients and BFT. Additionally, mechanisms like trusted proxies and inter-client communication introduce security and performance limitations.

Method: MVP-ORAM introduces a protocol that enables clients to process concurrent requests independently, merging conflicting updates when needed. It defines a weaker notion of obliviousness to address collision and wait-freedom contradictions.

Result: MVP-ORAM demonstrates secure performance in practical scenarios while supporting concurrent client accesses and is seamlessly integrated into confidential BFT data stores. A prototype processes hundreds of 4KB blocks per second.

Conclusion: MVP-ORAM achieves a scalable, secure, and efficient ORAM protocol supporting BFT and concurrent clients, marking significant progress for modern data privacy and storage solutions.

Abstract: It is well known that encryption alone is not enough to protect data privacy. Access patterns, revealed when operations are performed, can also be leveraged in inference attacks. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides access patterns by making client requests oblivious. However, existing protocols are still limited in supporting concurrent clients and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). We present MVP-ORAM, the first wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients. In contrast to previous works, MVP-ORAM avoids using trusted proxies, which require additional security assumptions, and concurrency control mechanisms based on inter-client communication or distributed locks, which limit overall throughput and the capability of tolerating faulty clients. Instead, MVP-ORAM enables clients to perform concurrent requests and merge conflicting updates as they happen, satisfying wait-freedom, i.e., clients make progress independently of the performance or failures of other clients. Since wait and collision freedom are fundamentally contradictory goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously in an asynchronous concurrent ORAM service, we define a weaker notion of obliviousness that depends on the application workload and number of concurrent clients, and prove MVP-ORAM is secure in practical scenarios where clients perform skewed block accesses. By being wait-free, MVP-ORAM can be seamlessly integrated into existing confidential BFT data stores, creating the first BFT ORAM construction. We implement MVP-ORAM on top of a confidential BFT data store and show our prototype can process hundreds of 4KB accesses per second in modern clouds.

TL;DR: This paper highlights security enhancements in blockchain and decentralized applications, proposing a security framework, addressing vulnerabilities, introducing secure authentication and voting systems, as well as secure logging and interoperability protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for better scalability, performance, and security in blockchains and decentralized applications due to their complexity and increasing usage.

Method: The paper develops a security reference architecture, studies consensus security in various blockchain models, introduces secure wallet authentication classifications, proposes innovative voting protocols, and extends secure logging using trusted computing.

Result: Key contributions include improving transaction security in Proof-of-Work blockchains, creating a scalable secure voting system, securing cryptocurrency wallets with advanced authentication, and proposing designs for secure interoperable digital currency protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions enhance both security and scalability in blockchain ecosystems, aiming to address critical vulnerabilities and adoption challenges in decentralized systems.

Abstract: With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many new applications built on decentralized blockchains have emerged. Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems.
  In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEDULity, a Proof-of-Learning (PoL) framework that replaces traditional Proof-of-Work with efficient, distributed ML training, ensuring blockchain security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency and sustainability concerns of traditional Proof-of-Work systems motivate the need for frameworks that redirect computational resources to meaningful tasks, addressing issues in existing PoL approaches.

Method: The paper encodes blockchain templates into the ML training process, designs a verification-friendly useful function as a substitute for PoW puzzles, and incorporates incentive mechanisms for honest training and task verification.

Result: The proposed SEDULity framework ensures security, decentralization, and efficient ML training, and proves its theoretical and simulated performance through analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: SEDULity advances blockchain technology by securely integrating useful work in a distributed system, providing an environmentally sustainable and incentivized alternative to Proof-of-Work.

Abstract: The security and decentralization of Proof-of-Work (PoW) have been well-tested in existing blockchain systems. However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.

### [640] [Rethinking Jailbreak Detection of Large Vision Language Models with Representational Contrastive Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12069)
*Peichun Hua,Hao Li,Shanghao Shi,Zhiyuan Yu,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a lightweight framework for detecting jailbreak attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), leveraging internal model representations for efficient anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defenses against multimodal jailbreak attacks are needed as LVLMs face vulnerabilities. Current methods lack generalization or are computationally expensive. Addressing these gaps is crucial for safer model deployments.

Method: RCS uses internal model representations to learn projections that separate benign and malicious inputs. It introduces contrastive scoring methods, MCD and KCD, to distinguish malicious intent effectively.

Result: MCD and KCD achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting unseen attack types, outperforming existing methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that analyzing internal representations with lightweight statistical methods enables effective, generalizable jailbreak detection in LVLMs, providing practical solutions for secure deployment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to a growing array of multimodal jailbreak attacks, necessitating defenses that are both generalizable to novel threats and efficient for practical deployment. Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment. Our code is available on Github https://github.com/sarendis56/Jailbreak_Detection_RCS.

To address these gaps, we introduce the \textbf{UniMark}, an open-source, unified framework for multimodal content governance. Our system features a modular unified engine that abstracts complexities across text, image, audio, and video modalities. Crucially, we propose a novel dual-operation strategy, natively supporting both \emph{Hidden Watermarking} for copyright protection and \emph{Visible Marking} for regulatory compliance. Furthermore, we establish a standardized evaluation framework with three specialized benchmarks (Image/Video/Audio-Bench) to ensure rigorous performance assessment. This toolkit bridges the gap between advanced algorithms and engineering implementation, fostering a more transparent and secure digital ecosystem.

TL;DR: The paper examines the potential of modern language models to compromise Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) by reverse engineering public-private keypairs. It explores vulnerabilities in current cryptographic security protocols and anticipates future developments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing concern about the security of algorithms like ECC in the era of machine learning and quantum computing, emphasizing limited prior testing of their strength and the rise of exploits.

Method: The study tests if language models can reverse engineer public key-pair generation processes and also evaluate their capacity to memorize secp256r1 keypairs. It involves experimenting and analyzing these processes.

Result: The authors aim to provide proof-of-concept either proving or disproving modern ML models' effectiveness in reversing cryptographic algorithms. Results will include insights into vulnerabilities and projections for the future.

Conclusion: The paper will conclude by presenting findings on the practicality of using modern ML models in cryptographic challenges, warning about ECC's potential decline in security, and projecting trends in this domain.

Abstract: With the advent of machine learning and quantum computing, the 21st century has gone from a place of relative algorithmic security, to one of speculative unease and possibly, cyber catastrophe.
  Modern algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are the bastion of current cryptographic security protocols that form the backbone of consumer protection ranging from Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in the modern internet browser, to cryptographic financial instruments like Bitcoin.
  And there's been very little work put into testing the strength of these ciphers. Practically the only study that I could find was on side-channel recognition, a joint paper from the University of Milan, Italy and King's College, London\cite{battistello2025ecc}.
  These algorithms are already considered bulletproof by many consumers, but exploits already exist for them, and with computing power and distributed, federated compute on the rise, it's only a matter of time before these current bastions fade away into obscurity, and it's on all of us to stand up when we notice something is amiss, lest we see such passages claim victims in that process.
  In this paper, we seek to explore the use of modern language model architecture in cracking the association between a known public key, and its associated private key, by intuitively learning to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process, effectively solving the curve.
  Additonally, we attempt to ascertain modern machine learning's ability to memorize public-private secp256r1 keypairs, and to then test their ability to reverse engineer the public keypair generation process.
  It is my belief that proof-for would be equally valuable as proof-against in either of these categories.
  Finally, we'll conclude with some number crunching on where we see this particular field heading in the future.

*Jie Ma,Junqing Zhang,Guanxiong Shen,Alan Marshall,Chip-Hong Chang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the vulnerability of wireless IoT device authentication systems (RFFI) to adversarial attacks using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of adversarial attacks on wireless IoT authentication systems based on deep learning models.

Method: The study used three adversarial attack algorithms (FGSM, PGD, UAP) and tested them against RFFI systems using CNN, LSTM, and GRU.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that UAP can achieve adversarial attack success rate of 81.7% in RFFI systems without prior knowledge.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based RFFI systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks under various conditions, emphasizing security risks in IoT device authentication systems.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging technique for the lightweight authentication of wireless Internet of things (IoT) devices. RFFI exploits deep learning models to extract hardware impairments to uniquely identify wireless devices. Recent studies show deep learning-based RFFI is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective adversarial attacks against different types of RFFI classifiers have not yet been explored. In this paper, we carried out a comprehensive investigations into different adversarial attack methods on RFFI systems using various deep learning models. Three specific algorithms, fast gradient sign method (FGSM), projected gradient descent (PGD), and universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), were analyzed. The attacks were launched to LoRa-RFFI and the experimental results showed the generated perturbations were effective against convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRU). We further used UAP to launch practical attacks. Special factors were considered for the wireless context, including implementing real-time attacks, the effectiveness of the attacks over a period of time, etc. Our experimental evaluation demonstrated that UAP can successfully launch adversarial attacks against the RFFI, achieving a success rate of 81.7% when the adversary almost has no prior knowledge of the victim RFFI systems.

*Hua Ma,Ruoxi Sun,Minhui Xue,Xingliang Yuan,Carsten Rudolph,Surya Nepal,Ling Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of time-series large language models (TS-LLMs) to adversarial examples (AEs) by proposing a detection mechanism based on sampling-induced divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and security of TS-LLMs for energy forecasting, as adversarial examples threaten their real-world deployment.

Method: A plug-in detection framework assessing forecast stability under sampling-induced divergences, leveraging TS-LLMs’ variable-length input handling.

Result: The method demonstrated robust performance against adversarial attacks across multiple TS-LLMs and energy datasets, working effectively in both black-box and white-box scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the resilience of TS-LLMs, making them practical for real-world energy forecasting applications in IoE systems.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting is increasingly critical for planning and operations in low-carbon power systems. Emerging time-series large language models (TS-LLMs) now deliver this capability at scale, requiring no task-specific retraining, and are quickly becoming essential components within the Internet-of-Energy (IoE) ecosystem. However, their real-world deployment is complicated by a critical vulnerability: adversarial examples (AEs). Detecting these AEs is challenging because (i) adversarial perturbations are optimized across the entire input sequence and exploit global temporal dependencies, which renders local detection methods ineffective, and (ii) unlike traditional forecasting models with fixed input dimensions, TS-LLMs accept sequences of variable length, increasing variability that complicates detection. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-in detection framework that capitalizes on the TS-LLM's own variable-length input capability. Our method uses sampling-induced divergence as a detection signal. Given an input sequence, we generate multiple shortened variants and detect AEs by measuring the consistency of their forecasts: Benign sequences tend to produce stable predictions under sampling, whereas adversarial sequences show low forecast similarity, because perturbations optimized for a full-length sequence do not transfer reliably to shorter, differently-structured subsamples. We evaluate our approach on three representative TS-LLMs (TimeGPT, TimesFM, and TimeLLM) across three energy datasets: ETTh2 (Electricity Transformer Temperature), NI (Hourly Energy Consumption), and Consumption (Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production). Empirical results confirm strong and robust detection performance across both black-box and white-box attack scenarios, highlighting its practicality as a reliable safeguard for TS-LLM forecasting in real-world energy systems.

*Shashie Dilhara Batan Arachchige,Benjamin Zi Hao Zhao,Hassan Jameel Asghar,Dinusha Vatsalan,Dali Kaafar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTIGuardian, a framework to mitigate privacy leakage in fine-tuned LLMs leveraging few-shot learning for privacy-relevant tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned Large Language Models often risk leaking proprietary or sensitive information, such as in cyber threat intelligence (CTI), necessitating privacy-preserving solutions.

Method: CTIGuardian enforces privacy protection by employing a privacy classifier and privacy redactor using few-shot supervision inspired by safety alignment principles in LLMs.

Result: CTIGuardian achieves a superior privacy-utility trade-off when compared to a baseline NER model, demonstrated through experiments on GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct.

Conclusion: CTIGuardian is an effective and efficient privacy-preserving method for fine-tuned models in CTI, with potential applicability in other sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned to adapt their general-purpose knowledge to specific tasks and domains such as cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Fine-tuning is mostly done through proprietary datasets that may contain sensitive information. Owners expect their fine-tuned model to not inadvertently leak this information to potentially adversarial end users. Using CTI as a use case, we demonstrate that data-extraction attacks can recover sensitive information from fine-tuned models on CTI reports, underscoring the need for mitigation. Retraining the full model to eliminate this leakage is computationally expensive and impractical. We propose an alternative approach, which we call privacy alignment, inspired by safety alignment in LLMs. Just like safety alignment teaches the model to abide by safety constraints through a few examples, we enforce privacy alignment through few-shot supervision, integrating a privacy classifier and a privacy redactor, both handled by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate our system, called CTIGuardian, using GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct models, benchmarking against Presidio, a named entity recognition (NER) baseline. Results show that CTIGuardian provides a better privacy-utility trade-off than NER based models. While we demonstrate its effectiveness on a CTI use case, the framework is generic enough to be applicable to other sensitive domains.

*Amy Chang,Tiffany Saade,Sanket Mendapara,Adam Swanda,Ankit Garg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cisco's Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework to address AI risks across its lifecycle, integrating security and safety comprehensively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of AI across critical domains has created an expanded attack surface, revealing gaps in existing frameworks addressing security and safety threats.

Method: The authors propose a unified and lifecycle-aware taxonomy and operationalization framework to classify, integrate, and manage AI risks comprehensively.

Result: The paper identifies limitations in existing frameworks and demonstrates how the proposed framework provides a structured approach to understanding AI system failures and building adaptive defenses.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework effectively provides a comprehensive, extensible solution for AI risk management and threat mitigation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being readily and rapidly adopted, increasingly permeating critical domains: from consumer platforms and enterprise software to networked systems with embedded agents. While this has unlocked potential for human productivity gains, the attack surface has expanded accordingly: threats now span content safety failures (e.g., harmful or deceptive outputs), model and data integrity compromise (e.g., poisoning, supply-chain tampering), runtime manipulations (e.g., prompt injection, tool and agent misuse), and ecosystem risks (e.g., orchestration abuse, multi-agent collusion). Existing frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-2 Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) taxonomy, and OWASP Top 10s for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI Applications provide valuable viewpoints, but each covers only slices of this multi-dimensional space.
  This paper presents Cisco's Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework ("AI Security Framework"), a unified, lifecycle-aware taxonomy and operationalization framework that can be used to classify, integrate, and operationalize the full range of AI risks. It integrates AI security and AI safety across modalities, agents, pipelines, and the broader ecosystem. The AI Security Framework is designed to be practical for threat identification, red-teaming, risk prioritization, and it is comprehensive in scope and can be extensible to emerging deployments in multimodal contexts, humanoids, wearables, and sensory infrastructures. We analyze gaps in prevailing frameworks, discuss design principles for our framework, and demonstrate how the taxonomy provides structure for understanding how modern AI systems fail, how adversaries exploit these failures, and how organizations can build defenses across the AI lifecycle that evolve alongside capability advancements.

### [648] [ceLLMate: Sandboxing Browser AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12594)
*Luoxi Meng,Henry Feng,Ilia Shumailov,Earlence Fernandes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ceLLMate, a sandboxing framework for browser-using agents (BUAs) to restrict unauthorized actions and mitigate prompt injection attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of BUAs that perform human-like web interactions has introduced vulnerabilities like prompt injection attacks, which can lead to undesired actions or leaks of private information.

Method: The authors propose ceLLMate, a framework that resolves challenges with policy enforcement via an agent sitemap and adds an automated policy-prediction layer. It combines website-defined mandatory policies with task-specific dynamic policies.

Result: ceLLMate, implemented as a browser extension, successfully restricts prompt injection attacks with minimal performance overhead, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ceLLMate enhances the safety of BUAs by sandboxing their authority and reducing associated risks, providing a promising solution to prompt injection vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Browser-using agents (BUAs) are an emerging class of autonomous agents that interact with web browsers in human-like ways, including clicking, scrolling, filling forms, and navigating across pages. While these agents help automate repetitive online tasks, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can trick an agent into performing undesired actions, such as leaking private information or issuing state-changing requests. We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that restricts the agent's ambient authority and reduces the blast radius of prompt injections. We address two fundamental challenges: (1) The semantic gap challenge in policy enforcement arises because the agent operates through low-level UI observations and manipulations; however, writing and enforcing policies directly over UI-level events is brittle and error-prone. To address this challenge, we introduce an agent sitemap that maps low-level browser behaviors to high-level semantic actions. (2) Policy prediction in BUAs is the norm rather than the exception. BUAs have no app developer to pre-declare sandboxing policies, and thus, ceLLMate pairs website-authored mandatory policies with an automated policy-prediction layer that adapts and instantiates these policies from the user's natural-language task. We implement ceLLMate as an agent-agnostic browser extension and demonstrate how it enables sandboxing policies that effectively block various types of prompt injection attacks with negligible overhead.

### [649] [Security and Detectability Analysis of Unicode Text Watermarking Methods Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13325)
*Malte Hellmeier*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies the security of digital text watermarking with large language models, analyzing detection and extraction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about securing digital text, especially against misuse in machine learning model training or distinguishing human-written vs. model-generated text.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments implementing and testing ten Unicode watermarking methods on six large language models.

Result: Latest reasoning models can detect watermarked text but cannot extract the watermark without source code.

Conclusion: Digital text watermarking is detectable but not fully extractable by current models; further research is needed to strengthen security.

Abstract: Securing digital text is becoming increasingly relevant due to the widespread use of large language models. Individuals' fear of losing control over data when it is being used to train such machine learning models or when distinguishing model-generated output from text written by humans. Digital watermarking provides additional protection by embedding an invisible watermark within the data that requires protection. However, little work has been taken to analyze and verify if existing digital text watermarking methods are secure and undetectable by large language models. In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data. In a controlled testbed of three experiments, ten existing Unicode text watermarking methods were implemented and analyzed across six large language models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, Teuken 7B, Llama 3.3, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The findings of our experiments indicate that, especially the latest reasoning models, can detect a watermarked text. Nevertheless, all models fail to extract the watermark unless implementation details in the form of source code are provided. We discuss the implications for security researchers and practitioners and outline future research opportunities to address security concerns.

*Sabrine Ennaji,Elhadj Benkhelifa,Luigi Vincenzo Mancini*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a mechanism for defending intrusion detection systems from black box adversarial attacks by adding dynamic perturbations, designed to confuse attackers while maintaining system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing defenses against black box adversarial attacks on intrusion detection systems, which often fail in real-world scenarios due to their rigidity, attack type dependence, and performance degradation.

Method: The paper proposes a dynamic approach named Adaptive Feature Poisoning, which uses traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb traffic features without hindering the detection system.

Result: The proposed defense was tested against various realistic adversarial attacks and proved effective in degrading attack success while maintaining detection performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive Feature Poisoning is a proactive, lightweight, and attack-agnostic solution, making it practical for defending machine learning-based intrusion detection systems against evolving adversarial strategies.

Abstract: Machine learning based intrusion detection systems are increasingly targeted by black box adversarial attacks, where attackers craft evasive inputs using indirect feedback such as binary outputs or behavioral signals like response time and resource usage. While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on static mechanisms that fail to generalize across evolving attack strategies. Furthermore, defenses such as input transformation can degrade intrusion detection system performance, making them unsuitable for real time deployment.
  To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a lightweight and proactive defense mechanism designed specifically for realistic black box scenarios. Adaptive Feature Poisoning assumes that probing can occur silently and continuously, and introduces dynamic and context aware perturbations to selected traffic features, corrupting the attacker feedback loop without impacting detection capabilities. The method leverages traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb features that an attacker is likely exploiting, based on observed deviations.
  We evaluate Adaptive Feature Poisoning against multiple realistic adversarial attack strategies, including silent probing, transferability based attacks, and decision boundary based attacks. The results demonstrate its ability to confuse attackers, degrade attack effectiveness, and preserve detection performance. By offering a generalizable, attack agnostic, and undetectable defense, Adaptive Feature Poisoning represents a significant step toward practical and robust adversarial resilience in machine learning based intrusion detection systems.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: AutoMV is introduced as a comprehensive multi-agent system for generating full-length, coherent music videos directly from songs, addressing the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty of generating temporally consistent, full-length music videos that align with musical structures and lyrics in an automated manner.

Method: A multi-agent system, AutoMV, was developed employing music processing tools to extract attributes and guide video generation with several agents, followed by evaluation via a new benchmark.

Result: AutoMV significantly outperforms existing methods in four high-level evaluation categories and narrows the performance gap compared to professional music videos.

Conclusion: AutoMV shows promise in advancing music-to-video generation, though challenges remain in automating professional-level evaluations using multimodal models.

Abstract: Music-to-Video (M2V) generation for full-length songs faces significant challenges. Existing methods produce short, disjointed clips, failing to align visuals with musical structure, beats, or lyrics, and lack temporal consistency. We propose AutoMV, a multi-agent system that generates full music videos (MVs) directly from a song. AutoMV first applies music processing tools to extract musical attributes, such as structure, vocal tracks, and time-aligned lyrics, and constructs these features as contextual inputs for following agents. The screenwriter Agent and director Agent then use this information to design short script, define character profiles in a shared external bank, and specify camera instructions. Subsequently, these agents call the image generator for keyframes and different video generators for "story" or "singer" scenes. A Verifier Agent evaluates their output, enabling multi-agent collaboration to produce a coherent longform MV. To evaluate M2V generation, we further propose a benchmark with four high-level categories (Music Content, Technical, Post-production, Art) and twelve ine-grained criteria. This benchmark was applied to compare commercial products, AutoMV, and human-directed MVs with expert human raters: AutoMV outperforms current baselines significantly across all four categories, narrowing the gap to professional MVs. Finally, we investigate using large multimodal models as automatic MV judges; while promising, they still lag behind human expert, highlighting room for future work.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces JointAVBench, a benchmark for evaluating Omni-Large Language Models' multi-modal reasoning abilities in audio-visual contexts. It assesses cognitive dimensions, audio types, and scene spans, demonstrating current limitations in accuracy levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate multi-modal dependencies, diverse audio information, and scene spans necessary for understanding videos.

Method: The authors propose JointAVBench, featuring strict audio-video correlation across various cognitive dimensions and types of audio information. An automated pipeline is used to synthesize questions and answers that require joint audio-visual understanding.

Result: Leading Omni-LLMs tested on the dataset achieved an average accuracy of 62.6%, outperforming uni-modal baselines but revealing limitations in cross-scene reasoning.

Conclusion: Current Omni-LLMs show potential but need improvement in mastering joint audio-visual understanding and reasoning across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Understanding videos inherently requires reasoning over both visual and auditory information. To properly evaluate Omni-Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs), which are capable of processing multi-modal information including vision and audio, an effective benchmark must comprehensively cover three key aspects: (1) multi-modal dependency (i.e., questions that cannot be answered using vision or audio alone), (2) diverse audio information types (e.g., speech, sound events), and (3) varying scene spans. However, existing datasets fall short in one or more of these dimensions, limiting strict and comprehensive evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce JointAVBench, a novel benchmark with strict audio-video correlation, spanning five cognitive dimensions, four audio information types (speech, sound events, music, vocal traits), and three scene spans (single-, cross-, and full-scene). Given the high cost of manual annotation, we propose an automated pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art vision-LLMs, audio-LLMs, and general-purpose LLMs to synthesize questions and answers that strictly require joint audio-visual understanding. We evaluate leading vision-only, audio-only, and Omni-LLMs on our dataset. Results show that even the best-performing Omni-LLM achieves an average accuracy of only 62.6\%, outperforming uni-modal baselines but revealing substantial room for improvement, especially in cross-scene reasoning.

### [653] [Adaptive Sampling for Hydrodynamic Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13532)
*Anshima Singh,David J. Silvester*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive machine learning-based approach to efficiently detect bifurcation boundaries in fluid flow problems using classifier networks and generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying bifurcation boundaries in fluid flow problems require extensive computational resources, making them inefficient for high-dimensional stability analysis.

Method: A combination of classifier networks and a deep generative model (KRnet) is used to adaptively refine the sampling of parameter space by concentrating efforts on regions of high uncertainty.

Result: The method improves efficiency, requiring fewer simulations to accurately identify bifurcation boundaries in fluid flows.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive process shows promise in scalable stability analysis, reducing computational costs and improving accuracy in identifying bifurcation boundaries.

Abstract: An adaptive sampling approach for efficient detection of bifurcation boundaries in parametrized fluid flow problems is presented herein. The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis.

*Eden Gross,Ryan Kruger,Francois Toerien*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper explores dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) for estimating expected shortfall (ES) and stressed expected shortfall (SES), finding that traditional models like EGARCH and GARCH outperform DBNs in extreme tail prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The global financial crisis highlighted the importance of accurately assessing market risk measures such as ES and SES, necessitating optimization of their estimation techniques.

Method: The authors applied three DBN structure-learning algorithms to estimate ES and SES, compared against traditional market risk models using normal and skewed Student's t return distributions, and backtested their performance using S&P 500 data.

Result: All models failed to accurately forecast ES and SES, particularly under the skewed Student's t distribution, with EGARCH(1,1) (normal) excelling for ES and GARCH(1,1) (normal) for SES. DBNs showed limited contribution to tail prediction.

Conclusion: Tail risk modeling remains challenging with current methods. DBNs performed comparably to historical simulations but require better weighting schemes for their forecasts to improve tail predictions.

Abstract: In the last five years, expected shortfall (ES) and stressed ES (SES) have become key required regulatory measures of market risk in the banking sector, especially following events such as the global financial crisis. Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation.

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that invariant foliations are effective tools for data-driven modeling, capable of fitting various types of data and predicting long-term dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately and efficiently modeling physical systems through data-driven approaches using invariant foliations.

Method: Invariant foliations are extended to address forced and parameter-dependent systems by leveraging volume-preserving maps and using full trajectory data. Over/underfitting is mitigated by careful selection of representation and hyperparameters.

Result: The method predicts long-term dynamics accurately and identifies invariant manifolds through invariant foliations using fewer parameters. Mathematical models are transformed into canonical forms for analysis.

Conclusion: Invariant foliations prove to be accurate, data-efficient, and practical for long-term prediction and modeling of physical systems, extending their applicability to complex dynamics.

Abstract: The paper demonstrates that invariant foliations are accurate, data-efficient and practical tools for data-driven modelling of physical systems. Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations. To interpret the results, the identified mathematical models are transformed to a canonical form and instantaneous frequency and damping information are calculated.

*Jiawei Yan,Ju Liu,Weidong Liu,Jiyuan Tu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust Variational Bayes framework to handle contaminated datasets and outliers, using subset aggregation and a min-max median optimization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of contamination and outliers in datasets, which can significantly impair traditional Variational Bayes analysis.

Method: Partition data into subsets, replace mean KL divergence with min-max median formulation, and separately handle scenarios based on the presence of local latent variables with specific strategies and enhanced theoretical analysis.

Result: The proposed method achieves smaller approximation error and a nearly optimal statistical rate for the mean of the posterior, validated by simulation studies.

Conclusion: The introduced framework improves the robustness and scalability of Variational Bayes analysis, particularly in contaminated datasets with rigorous theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable variational Bayes (VB) framework designed to effectively handle contamination and outliers in dataset. Our approach partitions the data into $m$ disjoint subsets and formulates a joint optimization problem based on robust aggregation principles. A key insight is that the full posterior distribution is equivalent to the minimizer of the mean Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the $m$-powered local posterior distributions. To enhance robustness, we replace the mean KL divergence with a min-max median formulation. The min-max formulation not only ensures consistency between the KL minimizer and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) maximizer but also facilitates the establishment of improved statistical rates for the mean of variational posterior. We observe a notable discrepancy in the $m$-powered marginal log likelihood function contingent on the presence of local latent variables. To address this, we treat these two scenarios separately to guarantee the consistency of the aggregated variational posterior. Specifically, when local latent variables are present, we introduce an aggregate-and-rescale strategy. Theoretically, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of our proposed posterior, incorporating a refined analysis of Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorem to accommodate a diverging number of subsets $m$. Our findings indicate that the two-stage approach yields a smaller approximation error compared to directly aggregating the $m$-powered local posteriors. Furthermore, we establish a nearly optimal statistical rate for the mean of the proposed posterior, advancing existing theories related to min-max median estimators. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies.

*Yilei Zhang,Yun Wei,Aritra Guha,XuanLong Nguyen*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses finite mixture models using nonparametric Bayesian approaches, aiming to enhance modeling flexibility for heterogeneous data populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from scenarios where parametric assumptions on subpopulation distributions are unrealistic, highlighting the importance of nonparametric modeling for mixture components.

Method: The authors combine finite mixture models with Bayesian nonparametric priors, specifically employing Dirichlet process mixtures and establish conditions for identifiability and posterior contraction. An efficient MCMC algorithm is developed for practical implementation.

Result: The methodology shows effective learning of complex latent subpopulation distributions verified through simulations and real-world datasets. Theoretical outcomes indicate nearly polynomial posterior contraction rates for component densities.

Conclusion: The study advances finite mixture modeling by incorporating nonparametric Bayesian methods, significantly improving the accuracy and flexibility of modeling heterogeneous data populations.

Abstract: Mixture models are widely used in modeling heterogeneous data populations. A standard approach of mixture modeling is to assume that the mixture component takes a parametric kernel form, while the flexibility of the model can be obtained by using a large or possibly unbounded number of such parametric kernels. In many applications, making parametric assumptions on the latent subpopulation distributions may be unrealistic, which motivates the need for nonparametric modeling of the mixture components themselves. In this paper we study finite mixtures with nonparametric mixture components, using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach. In particular, it is assumed that the data population is generated according to a finite mixture of latent component distributions, where each component is endowed with a Bayesian nonparametric prior such as the Dirichlet process mixture. We present conditions under which the individual mixture component's distributions can be identified, and establish posterior contraction behavior for the data population's density, as well as densities of the latent mixture components. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior inference and demonstrate via simulation studies and real-world data illustrations that it is possible to efficiently learn complex distributions for the latent subpopulations. In theory, the posterior contraction rate of the component densities is nearly polynomial, which is a significant improvement over the logarithm convergence rate of estimating mixing measures via deconvolution.

*Laura B. Balzer,Mark J. van der Laan,Maya L. Petersen*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper discusses a targeted machine learning estimation approach (TMLE) for covariate adjustment in trials to improve precision outcomes, applied to 8 recent trials and recommends its adoption in future studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to enhance the precision of clinical trial analyses by employing machine learning-based covariate adjustment techniques, motivated by the SEARCH Universal HIV Test-and-Treat Trial.

Method: The method involves using a targeted machine learning estimation (TMLE) with Adaptive Pre-specification. Sample-splitting selects estimators for outcome regression and propensity scores to minimize variance and maximize efficiency, with evaluations involving simulations and real-time implementation.

Result: The approach was successfully applied in 8 recently published trials (2022-2024), demonstrating its utility in conducting the pre-specified primary analysis with empirical efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with practical recommendations on using the TMLE approach for covariate adjustment in trials and invites researchers to implement this method in their future trials.

Abstract: Covariate adjustment is an approach to improve the precision of trial analyses by adjusting for baseline variables that are prognostic of the primary endpoint. Motivated by the SEARCH Universal HIV Test-and-Treat Trial (2013-2017), we tell our story of developing, evaluating, and implementing a machine learning-based approach for covariate adjustment. We provide the rationale for as well as the practical concerns with such an approach for estimating marginal effects. Using schematics, we illustrate our procedure: targeted machine learning estimation (TMLE) with Adaptive Pre-specification. Briefly, sample-splitting is used to data-adaptively select the combination of estimators of the outcome regression (i.e., the conditional expectation of the outcome given the trial arm and covariates) and known propensity score (i.e., the conditional probability of being randomized to the intervention given the covariates) that minimizes the cross-validated variance estimate and, thereby, maximizes empirical efficiency. We discuss our approach for evaluating finite sample performance with parametric and plasmode simulations, pre-specifying the Statistical Analysis Plan, and unblinding in real-time on video conference with our colleagues from around the world. We present the results from applying our approach in the primary, pre-specified analysis of 8 recently published trials (2022-2024). We conclude with practical recommendations and an invitation to implement our approach in the primary analysis of your next trial.

*Vladimir Berman*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simple model explaining word formation and linguistic patterns solely via morpheme combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how word length distributions and Zipf-like rank frequency curves emerge in natural languages without relying on communication efficiency or random processes.

Method: A combinatorial model creates words by probabilistically activating positional slots (prefixes, roots, suffixes, inflections) and selecting morphemes as stable building blocks.

Result: The model accurately replicates real language patterns like concentrated word lengths and Zipf-like frequency distributions, with simulations showing exponents similar to actual languages.

Conclusion: Morphological structure and probabilistic slot activation alone can explain linguistic patterns, without the need for meaning or communication-driven optimization.

Abstract: We present a simple structure based model of how words are formed from morphemes. The model explains two major empirical facts: the typical distribution of word lengths and the appearance of Zipf like rank frequency curves. In contrast to classical explanations based on random text or communication efficiency, our approach uses only the combinatorial organization of prefixes, roots, suffixes and inflections. In this Morphemic Combinatorial Word Model, a word is created by activating several positional slots. Each slot turns on with a certain probability and selects one morpheme from its inventory. Morphemes are treated as stable building blocks that regularly appear in word formation and have characteristic positions. This mechanism produces realistic word length patterns with a concentrated middle zone and a thin long tail, closely matching real languages. Simulations with synthetic morpheme inventories also generate rank frequency curves with Zipf like exponents around 1.1-1.4, similar to English, Russian and Romance languages. The key result is that Zipf like behavior can emerge without meaning, communication pressure or optimization principles. The internal structure of morphology alone, combined with probabilistic activation of slots, is sufficient to create the robust statistical patterns observed across languages.

### [660] [A fine-grained look at causal effects in causal spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11919)
*Junhyung Park,Yuqing Zhou*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper studies causal effects from a finer perspective by analyzing at the event level within a measure-theoretic framework, linking causality to independence, and proposing methods to quantify causal effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data lacks the semantic structure necessary to analyze causal effects traditionally at the variable level. The research is motivated by the need for a nuanced approach to studying causality.

Method: Using the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, it introduces binary definitions for causal effects, explores their properties, and provides quantifying measures linking causality and independence.

Result: The study recovers established treatment effect measures as special cases and offers new methods to assess causal strength and nature for events.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel perspective on causation, enhancing analytical capabilities for modern datasets lacking structured variables.

Abstract: The notion of causal effect is fundamental across many scientific disciplines. Traditionally, quantitative researchers have studied causal effects at the level of variables; for example, how a certain drug dose (W) causally affects a patient's blood pressure (Y). However, in many modern data domains, the raw variables-such as pixels in an image or tokens in a language model-do not have the semantic structure needed to formulate meaningful causal questions. In this paper, we offer a more fine-grained perspective by studying causal effects at the level of events, drawing inspiration from probability theory, where core notions such as independence are first given for events and sigma-algebras, before random variables enter the picture. Within the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, a recently introduced axiomatisation of causality, we first introduce several binary definitions that determine whether a causal effect is present, as well as proving some properties of them linking causal effect to (in)dependence under an intervention measure. Further, we provide quantifying measures that capture the strength and nature of causal effects on events, and show that we can recover the common measures of treatment effect as special cases.

*Bingbing Wang,Shengyan Sun,Jiaqi Wang,Yu Tang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robust regression framework to simultaneously detect outliers and concept drifts, employing a dual-channel mechanism and an advanced detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the combined challenges of outlier detection and concept drift detection in regression, areas traditionally treated separately.

Method: Developing a dual-channel decision process and the EWMAD-DT detector to classify and differentiate abrupt and incremental drifts.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets showed superior detection performance when outliers and concept drifts coexist.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates outlier and drift detection, offering improved and accurate analysis in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Outlier detection and concept drift detection represent two challenges in data analysis. Most studies address these issues separately. However, joint detection mechanisms in regression remain underexplored, where the continuous nature of output spaces makes distinguishing drifts from outliers inherently challenging. To address this, we propose a novel robust regression framework for joint outlier and concept drift detection. Specifically, we introduce a dual-channel decision process that orchestrates prediction residuals into two coupled logic flows: a rapid response channel for filtering point outliers and a deep analysis channel for diagnosing drifts. We further develop the Exponentially Weighted Moving Absolute Deviation with Distinguishable Types (EWMAD-DT) detector to autonomously differentiate between abrupt and incremental drifts via dynamic thresholding. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our unified framework, enhanced by EWMAD-DT, exhibits superior detection performance even when point outliers and concept drifts coexist.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a "joint contour location" (jCL) scheme to identify input configurations for multiple computer experiments simultaneously, improving efficiency and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify stable flight conditions that result in zero torque forces motivated the research, addressing experiments with multiple independent response values.

Method: A joint contour location (jCL) strategy is developed using Gaussian process surrogates to balance exploration and exploitation across multiple surfaces.

Result: The jCL strategy significantly outperforms existing (single response) contour location techniques for locating intersecting contours of multiple experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed jCL procedure efficiently locates joint contours, enhancing surrogate modeling capabilities for complex scenarios involving simultaneous multiple responses.

Abstract: Contour location$\unicode{x2014}$the process of sequentially training a surrogate model to identify the design inputs that result in a pre-specified response value from a single computer experiment$\unicode{x2014}$is a well-studied active learning problem. Here, we tackle a related but distinct problem: identifying the input configuration that returns pre-specified values of multiple independent computer experiments simultaneously. Motivated by computer experiments of the rotational torques acting upon a vehicle in flight, we aim to identify stable flight conditions which result in zero torque forces. We propose a "joint contour location" (jCL) scheme that strikes a strategic balance between exploring the multiple response surfaces while exploiting learning of the intersecting contours. We employ both shallow and deep Gaussian process surrogates, but our jCL procedure is applicable to any surrogate that can provide posterior predictive distributions. Our jCL designs significantly outperform existing (single response) CL strategies, enabling us to efficiently locate the joint contour of our motivating computer experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of GRN reconstruction, particularly addressing traditional spectral graph convolution's limitations in modeling GRNs as signed directed graphs.

Method: Proposed MSGRNLink that employs magnetic signed Laplacian convolution to extract both structural and biological features from GRNs modeled as signed directed graphs.

Result: MSGRNLink demonstrated superior performance in AUROC on simulated and real datasets. It also showed robustness through parameter sensitivity and ablation studies and excelled in prediction accuracy in a bladder cancer case study.

Conclusion: MSGRNLink is a robust and effective tool for GRN reconstruction, offering significant improvements in biological insight and network modeling over baseline methods.

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for understanding gene functions and disease mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides vast data for computational GRN reconstruction. Since GRNs are ideally modeled as signed directed graphs to capture activation/inhibition relationships, the most intuitive and reasonable approach is to design feature extractors based on the topological structure of GRNs to extract structural features, then combine them with biological characteristics for research. However, traditional spectral graph convolution struggles with this representation. Thus, we propose MSGRNLink, a novel framework that explicitly models GRNs as signed directed graphs and employs magnetic signed Laplacian convolution. Experiments across simulated and real datasets demonstrate that MSGRNLink outperforms all baseline models in AUROC. Parameter sensitivity analysis and ablation studies confirmed its robustness and the importance of each module. In a bladder cancer case study, MSGRNLink predicted more known edges and edge signs than benchmark models, further validating its biological relevance.

*Lankadinee Rathuwadu,Guanli Liu,Christopher Leckie,Renata Borovica-Gajic*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoLSE, a hybrid approach to improve the efficiency and accuracy of single-table cardinality estimation, blending copula theory and lightweight neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardinality estimation is crucial for efficient query optimization in databases, yet existing models fail to balance accuracy, efficiency, and memory usage.

Method: The authors propose CoLSE, which uses copula theory to model joint probability distributions and a lightweight neural network for better error correction.

Result: CoLSE demonstrates superior trade-offs in accuracy, training time, inference speed, and model size compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CoLSE proves to be an effective and efficient solution for single-table cardinality estimation, improving on the weaknesses of prior models by utilizing a hybrid approach.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CE), the task of predicting the result size of queries is a critical component of query optimization. Accurate estimates are essential for generating efficient query execution plans. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to CE, broadly categorized into query-driven and data-driven approaches. Data-driven methods learn the joint distribution of data, while query-driven methods construct regression models that map query features to cardinalities. Ideally, a CE technique should strike a balance among three key factors: accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint. However, existing state-of-the-art models often fail to achieve this balance.
  To address this, we propose CoLSE, a hybrid learned approach for single-table cardinality estimation. CoLSE directly models the joint probability over queried intervals using a novel algorithm based on copula theory and integrates a lightweight neural network to correct residual estimation errors. Experimental results show that CoLSE achieves a favorable trade-off among accuracy, training time, inference latency, and model size, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Continuous Edit Distance (CED), a geodesic and elastic distance for analyzing time-varying persistence diagrams (TVPDs), suitable for alignment, comparison, averaging, and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principled distances and tools for aligning, comparing, and clustering time-varying persistence diagrams (TVPDs).

Method: The authors define the Continuous Edit Distance (CED) with parameters for balancing temporal misalignment and spatial discrepancies. Explicit geodesic construction and two barycenter solvers (stochastic and greedy) for minimizing CED Frechet energy are introduced.

Result: The CED demonstrates robustness to perturbations, effectiveness in temporal alignment, and superior clustering results on real-life datasets compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: CED enables robust and interpretable analysis of TVPDs, offering a principled distance and practical tools for clustering and classification, with reproducibility ensured through an open-source C++ implementation.

Abstract: We introduce the Continuous Edit Distance (CED), a geodesic and elastic distance for time-varying persistence diagrams (TVPDs). The CED extends edit-distance ideas to TVPDs by combining local substitution costs with penalized deletions/insertions, controlled by two parameters: \(α\) (trade-off between temporal misalignment and diagram discrepancy) and \(β\) (gap penalty). We also provide an explicit construction of CED-geodesics. Building on these ingredients, we present two practical barycenter solvers, one stochastic and one greedy, that monotonically decrease the CED Frechet energy. Empirically, the CED is robust to additive perturbations (both temporal and spatial), recovers temporal shifts, and supports temporal pattern search. On real-life datasets, the CED achieves clustering performance comparable or better than standard elastic dissimilarities, while our clustering based on CED-barycenters yields superior classification results. Overall, the CED equips TVPD analysis with a principled distance, interpretable geodesics, and practical barycenters, enabling alignment, comparison, averaging, and clustering directly in the space of TVPDs. A C++ implementation is provided for reproducibility at the following address https://github.com/sebastien-tchitchek/ContinuousEditDistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in discovering and contextualizing literature due to the rapid growth of publications and limitations in current search tools.

Result: Evaluation showed improvements in retrieval relevance, topic coherence, and understanding of relational connections in the literature.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable tool for AI-driven exploration, improving scientific discovery and the interpretation of conceptual relationships within research.

Abstract: The rapid acceleration of scientific publishing has created substantial challenges for researchers attempting to discover, contextualize, and interpret relevant literature. Traditional keyword-based search systems provide limited semantic understanding, while existing AI-driven tools typically focus on isolated tasks such as retrieval, clustering, or bibliometric visualization. This paper presents an integrated system for scientific literature exploration that combines large-scale data acquisition, hybrid retrieval, semantic topic modeling, and heterogeneous knowledge graph construction. The system builds a comprehensive corpus by merging full-text data from arXiv with structured metadata from OpenAlex. A hybrid retrieval architecture fuses BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Topic modeling is performed on retrieved results using BERTopic or non-negative matrix factorization depending on computational resources. A knowledge graph unifies papers, authors, institutions, countries, and extracted topics into an interpretable structure. The system provides a multi-layered exploration environment that reveals not only relevant publications but also the conceptual and relational landscape surrounding a query. Evaluation across multiple queries demonstrates improvements in retrieval relevance, topic coherence, and interpretability. The proposed framework contributes an extensible foundation for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

*Vihan Lakshman,Blaise Munyampirwa,Julian Shun,Benjamin Coleman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper revisits the challenge of the curse of dimensionality in vector search and explores stability theory as a solution, with theoretical proofs and real-world experiments validating their results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The curse of dimensionality poses a significant challenge to efficient retrieval in high-dimensional neural embedding applications. This paper aims to revisit the problem and propose solutions informed by stability theory.

Method: The authors extend stability theory to three key retrieval scenarios: (i) multi-vector search (showing Chamfer distance maintains stability while average pooling may not), (ii) filtered vector search (introducing penalties for mismatches to induce stability), and (iii) sparse vector search (developing sufficient stability conditions).

Result: Theoretical findings from stability theory align with experimental results on synthetic and real datasets, providing practical insights for designing models and systems resistant to the curse of dimensionality.

Conclusion: Stability theory bridges the gap between theoretical limitations like the curse of dimensionality and practical vector search tasks, offering a framework to guide future advancements in neural embedding retrieval.

Abstract: Modern vector databases enable efficient retrieval over high-dimensional neural embeddings, powering applications from web search to retrieval-augmented generation. However, classical theory predicts such tasks should suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where distances between points become nearly indistinguishable, thereby crippling efficient nearest-neighbor search. We revisit this paradox through the lens of stability, the property that small perturbations to a query do not radically alter its nearest neighbors. Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions. Across synthetic and real datasets, our experimental results match our theoretical predictions, offering concrete guidance for model and system design to avoid the curse of dimensionality.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SCI, a framework addressing representational misalignment and index inconsistency in dense retrieval models, improving accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense retrieval systems face challenges like representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, impacting accuracy and stability, especially for long-tail queries and generative models.

Method: The SCI framework introduces a symmetric representation alignment module using input-swapping for unified space representation and a dual-view indexing strategy for consistent indexing.

Result: SCI demonstrates theoretical soundness and achieves improved performance on both public datasets and real-world e-commerce datasets with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: SCI is an effective, systematic, and lightweight solution enhancing dense retrieval for scalable, generative applications.

Abstract: Dense retrieval has become the industry standard in large-scale information retrieval systems due to its high efficiency and competitive accuracy. Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, with its effectiveness validated by results across public datasets and real-world e-commerce datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning e-commerce search results with buyers' evolving needs and preferences throughout the shopping journey, especially as they shift intentions or move to making purchase decisions.

Method: An incremental approach was employed, beginning with simple heuristic features and progressing to state-of-the-art contextual techniques like autoregressive and sequence models to adapt search results dynamically.

Result: The incremental enhancement significantly improved search ranker performance, validated through both offline and online A/B testing, with increased MRR metrics.

Conclusion: Iterative and context-aware methodologies for e-commerce search result optimization effectively align search outcomes with buyers’ interests, offering substantial benefits for ranker performance.

Abstract: In e-commerce shopping, aligning search results with a buyer's immediate needs and preferences presents a significant challenge, particularly in adapting search results throughout the buyer's shopping journey as they move from the initial stages of browsing to making a purchase decision or shift from one intent to another. This study presents a systematic approach to adapting e-commerce search results based on the current context. We start with basic methods and incrementally incorporate more contextual information and state-of-the-art techniques to improve the search outcomes. By applying this evolving contextual framework to items displayed on the search engine results page (SERP), we progressively align search outcomes more closely with the buyer's interests and current search intentions. Our findings demonstrate that this incremental enhancement, from simple heuristic autoregressive features to advanced sequence models, significantly improves ranker performance. The integration of contextual techniques enhances the performance of our production ranker, leading to improved search results in both offline and online A/B testing in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Overall, the paper details iterative methodologies and their substantial contributions to search result contextualization on e-commerce platforms.

Conclusion: Presented a validated, scalable framework for deploying dynamic graph learning in production to balance deep representation and real-time updates effectively.

Abstract: Deploying dynamic heterogeneous graph embeddings in production faces key challenges of scalability, data freshness, and cold-start. This paper introduces a practical, two-stage solution that balances deep graph representation with low-latency incremental updates. Our framework combines HetSGFormer, a scalable graph transformer for static learning, with Incremental Locally Linear Embedding (ILLE), a lightweight, CPU-based algorithm for real-time updates. HetSGFormer captures global structure with linear scalability, while ILLE provides rapid, targeted updates to incorporate new data, thus avoiding costly full retraining. This dual approach is cold-start resilient, leveraging the graph to create meaningful embeddings from sparse data. On billion-scale graphs, A/B tests show HetSGFormer achieved up to a 6.11% lift in Advertiser Value over previous methods, while the ILLE module added another 3.22% lift and improved embedding refresh timeliness by 83.2%. Our work provides a validated framework for deploying dynamic graph learning in production environments.

TL;DR: The paper investigates better ways to analyze student learning beyond correct/incorrect responses in virtual learning environments (VLE) by exploring additional indicators through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of most adaptive learning methods in VLEs, which focus narrowly on correct/incorrect answers, and to integrate a broader perspective on learning indicators.

Method: The authors conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to explore publications highlighting various learning indicators that influence student learning in VLEs.

Result: The review identifies diverse indicators such as motivation, emotions, physiological responses, brain imaging, and prior knowledge as influential in virtual learning.

Conclusion: Expanding adaptive technologies to include these indicators can lead to more personalized and comprehensive virtual learning experiences.

Abstract: Student learning development must involve more than just correcting or incorrect questions. However, most adaptive learning methods in Virtual Learning Environments are based on whether the student's response is incorrect or correct. This perspective is limited in assessing the student's learning level, as it does not consider other elements that can be crucial in this process. The objective of this work is to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to elucidate which learning indicators influence student learning and which can be implemented in a VLE to assist in adaptive learning. The works selected and filtered by qualitative assessment reveal a comprehensive approach to assessing different aspects of the learning in virtual environments, such as motivation, emotions, physiological responses, brain imaging, and the students' prior knowledge. The discussion of these new indicators allows adaptive technology developers to implement more appropriate solutions to students' realities, resulting in more complete training.

*Lucia Happe,Dominik Fuchß,Luca Hüttner,Kai Marquardt,Anne Koziolek*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces RockStartIT Tutor, an AI-powered tool designed to support programming education for secondary school students. It leverages GPT-4 with customized prompts and a structured knowledge base to provide personalized, context-sensitive guidance. Initial feedback from students and teachers highlights its potential benefits and current challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the potential of AI, particularly advances in large language models, to deliver scalable, individualized tutoring and enhance the educational experience for secondary school students.

Method: The authors designed RockStartIT Tutor, powered by GPT-4 and enriched with a modular, semantically tagged knowledge base. A pilot evaluation using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was conducted with 13 participants (students and teachers).

Result: Both students and teachers acknowledged the system's ability to reduce cognitive load, provide low-stakes learning environments, and complement traditional classroom teaching. However, challenges such as prototype limitations, small sample size, and the need for further studies were noted.

Conclusion: AI tutors like RockStartIT Tutor can serve as supplemental tools in education, enhancing feedback access and inquiry without replacing teachers. A structured, pragmatic approach can create effective AI-aided learning environments.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education continues to evoke both promise and skepticism. While past waves of technological optimism often fell short, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revived the vision of scalable, individualized tutoring. This paper presents the design and pilot evaluation of RockStartIT Tutor, an AI-powered assistant developed for a digital programming and computational thinking course within the RockStartIT initiative. Powered by GPT-4 via OpenAI's Assistant API, the tutor employs a novel prompting strategy and a modular, semantically tagged knowledge base to deliver context-aware, personalized, and curriculum-constrained support for secondary school students. We evaluated the system using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with 13 students and teachers. Learners appreciated the low-stakes environment for asking questions and receiving scaffolded guidance. Educators emphasized the system's potential to reduce cognitive load during independent tasks and complement classroom teaching. Key challenges include prototype limitations, a small sample size, and the need for long-term studies with the target age group. Our findings highlight a pragmatic approach to AI integration that requires no model training, using structure and prompts to shape behavior. We position AI tutors not as teacher replacements but as enabling tools that extend feedback access, foster inquiry, and support what schools do best: help students learn.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques AI scribes by highlighting their potential impact on reshaping medical attention, emphasizing a shift from relational to calculative modes of care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the deeper implications of AI scribes beyond efficiency, particularly their influence on medical attention and the philosophy of clinical practice.

Method: Conceptual analysis drawing on philosophical theories, including McGilchrist's hemisphere theory and Mumford's philosophy of technics.

Result: Findings describe how AI scribes enhance a calculative mindset in medicine, prioritizing measurable and procedural aspects over intuitive and relational practices.

Conclusion: The integration of AI scribes may risk narrowing medical care, eroding clinical expertise, and turning physicians into operators in a mechanized healthcare system.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) scribes, systems that record and summarise patient-clinician interactions, are promoted as solutions to administrative overload. This paper argues that their significance lies not in efficiency gains but in how they reshape medical attention itself. Offering a conceptual analysis, it situates AI scribes within a broader philosophical lineage concerned with the externalisation of human thought and skill. Drawing on Iain McGilchrist's hemisphere theory and Lewis Mumford's philosophy of technics, the paper examines how technology embodies and amplifies a particular mode of attention. AI scribes, it contends, exemplify the dominance of a left-hemispheric, calculative mindset that privileges the measurable and procedural over the intuitive and relational. As this mode of attention becomes further embedded in medical practice, it risks narrowing the field of care, eroding clinical expertise, and reducing physicians to operators within an increasingly mechanised system.

*Izabela Lipinska,Hugh Brosnahan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper suggests that interactions with large language models (LLMs) may evoke psychotic involvement by fostering a relational dynamic reminiscent of folie a deux, due to tensions presented by their language use and lack of autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the psychological and relational risks users face when interacting with LLMs, particularly in emotionally sensitive contexts.

Method: Analyzed clinical literature including Bateson's double bind theory, McGilchrist's hemisphere theory, and case studies, while incorporating emerging clinical reports and phenomenological insights.

Result: Describes how high linguistic coherence coupled with a lack of true interiority in LLMs creates tension that can lead to imaginative projection by users, especially those in emotional need.

Conclusion: Advocates for 'ontological honesty' as a design principle to alleviate the risks of technologically induced folie a deux.

Abstract: This paper argues that contemporary large language models (LLMs) can contribute to psychotic involvement by creating interactions that resemble the relational dynamics of folie a deux. Drawing on Bateson's double bind theory, clinical literature on shared psychotic disorder, and McGilchrist's hemisphere theory, we show how the combination of high linguistic coherence and the absence of an underlying subject produces a structural tension for the user: language suggests an interlocutor, while intuition registers a void. In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk. We conclude by proposing 'ontological honesty' as a necessary design principle for mitigating technologically mediated folie a deux.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study evaluates the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to assess greenspace attractiveness using Google Street View images compared to human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether MLLMs can effectively assess greenspace attractiveness, addressing gaps in current resource-intensive methods that often neglect subjective perceptions and transient urban spaces.

Method: The researchers compared MLLM outputs with resident geo-survey responses in Lodz, Poland. They analyzed both formal and informal greenspaces, assessing perception matches and common reasoning categories given by the models and residents.

Result: High AI-human agreement was found for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal ones, while lower alignment was noted for other categories. MLLMs underemphasized factors like safety and local context, focusing more on aesthetic or design attributes.

Conclusion: MLLMs show potential for scalable pre-assessments of greenspaces but require human oversight and participatory methods for nuanced and context-sensitive evaluations.

Abstract: Understanding greenspace attractiveness is essential for designing livable and inclusive urban environments, yet existing assessment approaches often overlook informal or transient spaces and remain too resource intensive to capture subjective perceptions at scale. This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice.

### [677] [Expert Assessment: The Systemic Environmental Risks of Artficial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11863)
*Julian Schön,Lena Hoffmann,Nikolas Becker*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI offers solutions for societal issues like climate change but poses systemic environmental risks by impacting broader socioecological systems beyond direct resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand and analyze the systemic environmental risks caused by AI's integration into infrastructures, moving beyond direct energy and water usage impacts.

Method: The authors used a narrative literature review and proposed a three-level framework that examines the structural conditions, risk amplification mechanisms, and observable ecological and social impacts.

Result: The framework provides insights into how systemic conditions related to AI development amplify environmental harm, demonstrated through case studies in agriculture, biodiversity, oil and gas, and waste management.

Conclusion: While quantifying systemic environmental risks remains uncertain, the proposed framework illustrates the broader impacts of AI integration, offering a structure for understanding emergent ecological and societal risks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is often presented as a key tool for addressing societal challenges, such as climate change. At the same time, AI's environmental footprint is expanding increasingly. This report describes the systemic environmental risks of artificial intelligence, in particular, moving beyond direct impacts such as energy and water usage. Systemic environmental risks of AI are emergent, cross-sector harms to climate, biodiversity, freshwater, and broader socioecological systems that arise primarily from AI's integration into social, economic, and physical infrastructures, rather than its direct resource use, and that propagate through feedbacks, yielding nonlinear, inequitable, and potentially irreversible impacts. While these risks are emergent and quantification is uncertain, this report aims to provide an overview of systemic environmental risks. Drawing on a narrative literature review, we propose a three-level framework that operationalizes systemic risk analysis. The framework identifies the structural conditions that shape AI development, the risk amplification mechanisms that propagate environmental harm, and the impacts that manifest as observable ecological and social consequences. We illustrate the framework in expert-interview-based case studies across agriculture and biodiversity, oil and gas, and waste management.

Conclusion: The IARC provides a lightweight, task-agnostic solution for documenting and ensuring compliance with AI robustness requirements.

Abstract: Industrial AI practitioners face vague robustness requirements in emerging regulations and standards but lack concrete, implementation ready protocols. This paper introduces the Industrial AI Robustness Card (IARC), a lightweight, task agnostic protocol for documenting and evaluating the robustness of AI models on industrial time series. The IARC specifies required fields and an empirical measurement and reporting protocol that combines drift monitoring, uncertainty quantification, and stress tests, and it maps these to relevant EU AI Act obligations. A soft sensor case study on a biopharmaceutical fermentation process illustrates how the IARC supports reproducible robustness evidence and continuous monitoring.

*Mulham Fawkherji,Bruce Race,Driss Benhaddou*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper focuses on achieving net-zero emissions in auto-dependent cities like Houston by 2050, primarily through reducing on-road transportation emissions and adopting policies focused on ZEVs and transit improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and health impacts caused by on-road transportation in cities like Houston, which is critical for achieving global climate targets.

Method: The study establishes an on-road emissions baseline and evaluates socio-economic and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)-based policies to promote Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption and reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). Unity 3D is used for dynamic urban mobility simulation and policy visualization.

Result: Key strategies include using smart parking, transit incentives, data systems, and ZEV fleet management to address emission reductions and system reliability. Indicators and technologies provide actionable insights for policy implementation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by leveraging targeted strategies and advanced modeling tools, auto-dependent cities can make significant progress towards their 2050 net-zero emission goals.

Abstract: Globally, on-road transportation accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an estimated 385,000 premature deaths from PM2.5. Cities play a critical role in meeting IPCC targets, generating 75% of global energy-related GHG emissions. In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability. Policy options are analyzed and potential actions identified. To support evaluation, a simulation environment was developed in Unity 3D, enabling dynamic modeling of urban mobility and visualization of policy scenarios. Auto-dependent cities aiming for 2050 emission targets can benefit from the indicators, metrics, and technologies discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand not just AI usage but also how and when users interact with AI across contexts and devices.

Method: Analyzed large-scale de-identified AI usage data from January to September 2025, focusing on usage context, device types, and temporal rhythms.

Result: Patterns revealed contextual and temporal differences: health topics dominate mobile use, work and technology dominate on desktops during business hours, and varying interests peak at specific times.

Conclusion: Users have seamlessly integrated AI into their lives, utilizing it as a work tool on desktops and as a companion on mobile devices.

Abstract: We analyze 37.5 million deidentified conversations with Microsoft's Copilot between January and September 2025. Unlike prior analyses of AI usage, we focus not just on what people do with AI, but on how and when they do it. We find that how people use AI depends fundamentally on context and device type. On mobile, health is the dominant topic, which is consistent across every hour and every month we observed - with users seeking not just information but also advice. On desktop, the pattern is strikingly different: work and technology dominate during business hours, with "Work and Career" overtaking "Technology" as the top topic precisely between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. These differences extend to temporal rhythms: programming queries spike on weekdays while gaming rises on weekends, philosophical questions climb during late-night hours, and relationship conversations surge on Valentine's Day. These patterns suggest that users have rapidly integrated AI into the full texture of their lives, as a work aid at their desks and a companion on their phones.

*Wenqi Marshall Guo,Qingyun Qian,Khalad Hasan,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Image generation models are biased towards producing aesthetically pleasing outputs, even when users request 'anti-aesthetic' outputs. Reward systems reinforce this bias, compromising user autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether image generation models respect user intent, particularly when 'anti-aesthetic' or non-conventionally beautiful outputs are desired.

Method: The study constructed a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset and evaluated state-of-the-art image generation and reward models against user-specified prompts, including tests using real abstract artworks.

Result: Generation models prioritized conventional aesthetics by default, and reward models penalized 'anti-aesthetic' imagery, even those accurately matching user prompts.

Conclusion: Current models and reward systems privilege developer-centered aesthetic values, undermining user autonomy and aesthetic diversity.

Abstract: Over-aligning image generation models to a generalized aesthetic preference conflicts with user intent, particularly when ``anti-aesthetic" outputs are requested for artistic or critical purposes. This adherence prioritizes developer-centered values, compromising user autonomy and aesthetic pluralism. We test this bias by constructing a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset and evaluating state-of-the-art generation and reward models. We find that aesthetic-aligned generation models frequently default to conventionally beautiful outputs, failing to respect instructions for low-quality or negative imagery. Crucially, reward models penalize anti-aesthetic images even when they perfectly match the explicit user prompt. We confirm this systemic bias through image-to-image editing and evaluation against real abstract artworks.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates current practices and challenges in testing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs), highlights gaps in existing research, and suggests future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of autonomous driving systems in complex real-world environments, addressing the challenges in their testing processes is essential.

Method: The study reviews research and industry practices, examines emerging factors like V2X communication and foundation models, and conducts a large-scale survey with 100 participants, complemented by an analysis of over 100 studies.

Result: Existing testing methods fail to fully address key challenges such as diversity of corner cases, simulation-reality gap, systematic criteria, V2X deployment issues, and computational costs. The study consolidates gaps and needs within the field.

Conclusion: Research must focus on comprehensive testing criteria, cross-model and cross-modality collaboration, and scalable validation frameworks to advance ADS testing effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) promise improved transportation efficiency and safety, yet ensuring their reliability in complex real-world environments remains a critical challenge. Effective testing is essential to validate ADS performance and reduce deployment risks. This study investigates current ADS testing practices for both modular and end-to-end systems, identifies key demands from industry practitioners and academic researchers, and analyzes the gaps between existing research and real-world requirements. We review major testing techniques and further consider emerging factors such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and foundation models, including large language models and vision foundation models, to understand their roles in enhancing ADS testing. We conducted a large-scale survey with 100 participants from both industry and academia. Survey questions were refined through expert discussions, followed by quantitative and qualitative analyses to reveal key trends, challenges, and unmet needs. Our results show that existing ADS testing techniques struggle to comprehensively evaluate real-world performance, particularly regarding corner case diversity, the simulation to reality gap, the lack of systematic testing criteria, exposure to potential attacks, practical challenges in V2X deployment, and the high computational cost of foundation model-based testing. By further analyzing participant responses together with 105 representative studies, we summarize the current research landscape and highlight major limitations. This study consolidates critical research gaps in ADS testing and outlines key future research directions, including comprehensive testing criteria, cross-model collaboration in V2X systems, cross-modality adaptation for foundation model-based testing, and scalable validation frameworks for large-scale ADS evaluation.

*Jon Crowcroft,Rute C. Sofia,Dirk Trossen,Vassilis Tsaoussidis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the tensions in AI governance between equitable access, resource constraints, and the need for sustainability, advocating for recognizing AI as an 'Intergenerational Civil Right.' It proposes a framework for equitable AI deployment combining governance principles and technological innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the conflict in AI governance: balancing expanding access to AI for equity and inclusion versus the risks of unsustainable resource consumption and restricted access entrenching inequality.

Method: The authors propose recognizing access to AI as an 'Intergenerational Civil Right,' supported by an ethical framework. They suggest technical solutions using IoT--Edge--Cloud computing, decentralized systems, and energy-aware networking.

Result: The paper outlines a proposed legal, ethical, and technical pathway to realize equitable AI access while considering resource constraints.

Conclusion: Framing AI as essential social infrastructure leads to governance models and technological solutions that ensure fairness, sustainability, and long-term societal well-being, protecting both present and future generations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a foundational layer of social, economic, and cognitive infrastructure. At the same time, the training and large-scale deployment of AI systems rely on finite and unevenly distributed energy, networking, and computational resources. This tension exposes a largely unexamined problem in current AI governance: while expanding access to AI is essential for social inclusion and equal opportunity, unconstrained growth in AI use risks unsustainable resource consumption, whereas restricting access threatens to entrench inequality and undermine basic rights.
  This paper argues that access to AI outputs largely derived from publicly produced knowledge should not be treated solely as a commercial service, but as a fundamental civil interest requiring explicit protection. We show that existing regulatory frameworks largely ignore the coupling between equitable access and resource constraints, leaving critical questions of fairness, sustainability, and long-term societal impact unresolved. To address this gap, we propose recognizing access to AI as an \emph{Intergenerational Civil Right}, establishing a legal and ethical framework that simultaneously safeguards present-day inclusion and the rights of future generations.
  Beyond normative analysis, we explore how this principle can be technically realized. Drawing on emerging paradigms in IoT--Edge--Cloud computing, decentralized inference, and energy-aware networking, we outline technological trajectories and a strawman architecture for AI Delivery Networks that support equitable access under strict resource constraints. By framing AI as a shared social infrastructure rather than a discretionary market commodity, this work connects governance principles with concrete system design choices, offering a pathway toward AI deployment that is both socially just and environmentally sustainable.

TL;DR: The paper explores how generative AI reshapes work, creativity, and societal policies like UBI, using mixed methodologies to propose governance frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accelerating evolution of AI systems is redefining employment, creativity, and economic frameworks while raising questions about equity and effective governance.

Method: Mixed methodology combining labor market modeling, diffusion mapping, policy analysis, and discourse critique.

Result: The study identifies societal implications of AI, including potential degradation in model performance over time and challenges such as echo chambers in user interactions.

Conclusion: Policymakers must consider universal basic income within a broader governance framework, emphasizing creativity, inclusiveness, and balanced AI model design.

Abstract: The accelerating advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems is reshaping the nature, distribution and meaning of work, creativity, and economic security. This paper investigates four inter-related phenomena in the current AI era: (1) the evolving landscape of employment and the future of work; (2) the diverse patterns of AI adoption across socio-demographic groups, sectors, and geographies; (3) whether universal basic income (UBI) should become a compulsory policy response to the AI revolution; and (4) the implications of AI content policies and model behaviours for human creativity, wellbeing, and everyday decision-making. Furthermore, the paper tests the hypothesis that newer model generations may perform worse than their predecessors, and examines how users' interactions with AI systems may produce echo chambers through sycophantic model alignment. Using a mixed methodology that integrates labour market task-exposure modelling, sectoral diffusion mapping, policy-framework analysis, and qualitative discourse critique, this study develops a comprehensive framework for understanding the societal consequences of AI systems beyond productivity gains. It argues that to foster an inclusive, meaningful, and creative environment, policymakers must treat UBI as one dimension within a broader ecosystem of governance, skills development, creativity preservation, and model design. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions, including systematic evaluation of AI's creative performance across model generations, construction of a taxonomy of AI-usage distribution and equity, and formulation of governance criteria to balance content restrictions with creative freedom.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ERL4SIIP, an Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning framework to reform STEM education by solving issues in using Large Language Models for active Socratic interdisciplinary teaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in existing methodologies like Prompt Engineering and Reinforcement Learning that fail in modeling student cognition, managing reward sparsity, and maintaining diverse strategies.

Method: It formalizes the Socratic Interdisciplinary Instructional Problem as a POMDP and introduces ERL4SIIP combining dynamic student simulation, hierarchical rewards, and LoRA-Division optimization with evolutionary algorithms.

Result: ERL4SIIP offers structured solutions, including effective modeling of latent cognitive states, dense reward mechanisms, and strategic policy diversity for educational applications.

Conclusion: ERL4SIIP demonstrates potential in improving modern STEM education by enabling active learning paradigms aligned with higher-order cognitive abilities through innovative reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Cultivating higher-order cognitive abilities -- such as knowledge integration, critical thinking, and creativity -- in modern STEM education necessitates a pedagogical shift from passive knowledge transmission to active Socratic construction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for STEM Interdisciplinary education, current methodologies employing Prompt Engineering (PE), Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), or standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) often fall short of supporting this paradigm. Existing methods are hindered by three fundamental challenges: the inability to dynamically model latent student cognitive states; severe reward sparsity and delay inherent in long-term educational goals; and a tendency toward policy collapse lacking strategic diversity due to reliance on behavioral cloning. Recognizing the unobservability and dynamic complexity of these interactions, we formalize the Socratic Interdisciplinary Instructional Problem (SIIP) as a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), demanding simultaneous global exploration and fine-grained policy refinement. To this end, we propose ERL4SIIP, a novel Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework specifically tailored for this domain. ERL4SIIP integrates: (1) a dynamic student simulator grounded in a STEM knowledge graph for latent state modeling; (2) a Hierarchical Reward Mechanism that decomposes long-horizon goals into dense signals; and (3) a LoRA-Division based optimization strategy coupling evolutionary algorithms for population-level global search with PPO for local gradient ascent.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a preliminary taxonomy organizing AI risk mitigations into four categories and 23 subcategories, aiming to overcome fragmentation in the landscape of AI risk mitigation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of coordination and fragmented frameworks in AI risk mitigation prompted the authors to organize mitigations and provide a unified reference.

Method: A rapid evidence scan of 13 frameworks published between 2023-2025, clustering and coding 831 AI risk mitigations into a structured taxonomy.

Result: Creation of the AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy with categories such as Governance & Oversight, Technical & Security, Operational Process, and Transparency & Accountability.

Conclusion: The taxonomy provides a valuable starting point to harmonize AI risk mitigations and facilitate coordinated actions across actors in the AI ecosystem.

Abstract: Organizations and governments that develop, deploy, use, and govern AI must coordinate on effective risk mitigation. However, the landscape of AI risk mitigation frameworks is fragmented, uses inconsistent terminology, and has gaps in coverage. This paper introduces a preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy to organize AI risk mitigations and provide a common frame of reference. The Taxonomy was developed through a rapid evidence scan of 13 AI risk mitigation frameworks published between 2023-2025, which were extracted into a living database of 831 AI risk mitigations. The mitigations were iteratively clustered & coded to create the Taxonomy. The preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy organizes mitigations into four categories and 23 subcategories: (1) Governance & Oversight: Formal organizational structures and policy frameworks that establish human oversight mechanisms and decision protocols; (2) Technical & Security: Technical, physical, and engineering safeguards that secure AI systems and constrain model behaviors; (3) Operational Process: processes and management frameworks governing AI system deployment, usage, monitoring, incident handling, and validation; and (4) Transparency & Accountability: formal disclosure practices and verification mechanisms that communicate AI system information and enable external scrutiny. The rapid evidence scan and taxonomy construction also revealed several cases where terms like 'risk management' and 'red teaming' are used widely but refer to different responsible actors, actions, and mechanisms of action to reduce risk. This Taxonomy and associated mitigation database, while preliminary, offers a starting point for collation and synthesis of AI risk mitigations. It also offers an accessible, structured way for different actors in the AI ecosystem to discuss and coordinate action to reduce risks from AI.

*Eren Kurshan,Tucker Balch,David Byrd*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores AI governance in financial markets, proposing a modular architecture for monitoring evolving AI models in trading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inability of current model-risk frameworks to address the dynamic nature of generative AI and multi-agent systems in financial markets.

Method: Using complex adaptive systems theory, the paper proposes a governance architecture with four modular layers for AI oversight.

Result: The proposed framework quarantines harmful AI behaviors in real-time without hindering innovation, demonstrating its efficacy in a case study on spoofing in trading.

Conclusion: The suggested governance structure closes control gaps in model-risk rules and ensures resilient oversight of AI in financial markets.

Abstract: Generative and agentic artificial intelligence is entering financial markets faster than existing governance can adapt. Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of "regulatory blocks": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation. The architecture remains compatible with today's model-risk rules yet closes critical observability and control gaps, providing a practical path toward resilient, adaptive AI governance in financial systems.

*Adeleh Mazaherian,Erfan Nourbakhsh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study evaluates user perceptions of AI education apps using sentiment analysis, showing positive trends overall but disparities among app types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand user perceptions of AI education apps and identify strengths, challenges, and implications for their educational integration.

Method: The study analyzed Google Play Store reviews of top AI educational apps via scraping, sentiment analysis using RoBERTa, key point extraction with GPT-4o, and summary synthesis with GPT-5.

Result: Results showed homework apps like Edu AI (95.9% positive) excelled in accuracy and speed, while language apps performed poorly. Positive feedback highlights efficiency and personalization, while negatives mention paywalls, glitches, and ads.

Conclusion: Homework helpers outshine specialized tools, showing AI's potential to democratize education but stress risks like dependency. Proposals include improving hybrid AI-human systems, incorporating VR/AR, and guiding regulatory policies for inclusivity.

Abstract: The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence into education has driven digital transformation in e-teaching, yet user perceptions of AI educational apps remain underexplored. This study performs a sentiment-driven evaluation of user reviews from top AI ed-apps on the Google Play Store to assess efficacy, challenges, and pedagogical implications. Our pipeline involved scraping app data and reviews, RoBERTa for binary sentiment classification, GPT-4o for key point extraction, and GPT-5 for synthesizing top positive/negative themes. Apps were categorized into seven types (e.g., homework helpers, math solvers, language tools), with overlaps reflecting multifunctional designs. Results indicate predominantly positive sentiments, with homework apps like Edu AI (95.9% positive) and Answer.AI (92.7%) leading in accuracy, speed, and personalization, while language/LMS apps (e.g., Teacher AI at 21.8% positive) lag due to instability and limited features. Positives emphasize efficiency in brainstorming, problem-solving, and engagement; negatives center on paywalls, inaccuracies, ads, and glitches. Trends show that homework helpers outperform specialized tools, highlighting AI's democratizing potential amid risks of dependency and inequity. The discussion proposes future ecosystems with hybrid AI-human models, VR/AR for immersive learning, and a roadmap for developers (adaptive personalization) and policymakers (monetization regulation for inclusivity). This underscores generative AI's role in advancing e-teaching by enabling ethical refinements that foster equitable, innovative environments.

### [689] [A neuro-symbolic framework for accountability in public-sector AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12109)
*Allen Daniel Sunny*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to ensure automated eligibility systems provide legally consistent explanations for public assistance decisions, specifically within CalFresh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of legally grounded explanations in automated eligibility systems, which can undermine accountability in public benefits decisions.

Method: The approach integrates a structured ontology of eligibility laws, a rule extraction pipeline for statutory logic, and a solver-based reasoning mechanism.

Result: The framework can detect inconsistencies in system-generated explanations and trace violations of eligibility rules, thus improving procedural accountability.

Conclusion: The study provides a pathway to enhance the transparency and accountability of automated eligibility systems by ensuring decisions reflect legal statutes.

Abstract: Automated eligibility systems increasingly determine access to essential public benefits, but the explanations they generate often fail to reflect the legal rules that authorize those decisions. This thesis develops a legally grounded explainability framework that links system-generated decision justifications to the statutory constraints of CalFresh, California's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The framework combines a structured ontology of eligibility requirements derived from the state's Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP), a rule extraction pipeline that expresses statutory logic in a verifiable formal representation, and a solver-based reasoning layer to evaluate whether the explanation aligns with governing law. Case evaluations demonstrate the framework's ability to detect legally inconsistent explanations, highlight violated eligibility rules, and support procedural accountability by making the basis of automated determinations traceable and contestable.

### [690] [The Art of Storytelling in Authoritarian Regimes: Crafting State Narratives on Chinese Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11875)
*Ting Luo,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores how authoritarian regimes craft narratives about major events using social media, focusing on legitimacy and citizen verification capacity, through analysis of Chinese social media content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how authoritarian regimes sustain control by shaping narratives around politically relevant events and the role of propaganda mechanisms.

Method: Quantitative narrative analysis of Chinese social media posts, using Subject-Verb-Object triplets to identify dominant themes across four significant events.

Result: Regimes adjust their storytelling based on the event's legitimacy implications and the ability of citizens to verify narratives, balancing manipulation with responsiveness.

Conclusion: Authoritarian propaganda is an adaptive process aimed at sustaining regime resilience through strategic narrative construction, influenced by context-specific factors.

Abstract: This article examines how authoritarian regimes construct state narratives about politically consequential events. Building on the narrative policy framework and existing research on authoritarian propaganda, we propose two dimensions that shape narrative construction: legitimacy implications -- whether events enhance or threaten regime legitimacy, and citizen verification capacity -- the extent to which citizens can evaluate official narratives through alternative sources. Using quantitative narrative analysis of Chinese social media posts by government, state media, and celebrity accounts, we extract subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets to map dominant narrative structures across four major events. Our findings show that legitimacy implications of the event shape regime's efforts in storytelling and the beliefs highlighted in the narratives, while citizen's verification capacity could balance the strategic choice between a top-down manipulation and bottom-up responsiveness of state narratives. Together, the results reveal propaganda as a complex process of narrative construction adaptive to specific contexts, offering new insights into how dynamic storytelling sustains authoritarian resilience.

*Juan Palomeque-Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a workflow for converting legacy archaeological image collections into structured datasets ready for segmentation using tools and ethical practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the lack of automated processing methods and bulk downloads for standardized archaeological image collections, specifically for Lower Palaeolithic hand axe and biface datasets.

Method: Two open-source tools were developed: a web scraping script to retrieve metadata and images while adhering to ethical standards, and an image processing pipeline for renaming, generating masks, bounding boxes, and structured data JSON files.

Result: The tools enable the transformation of web-based archaeological image collections into machine learning-compatible datasets, which can be reused for research.

Conclusion: This reproducible workflow supports digital archaeology by creating structured datasets that facilitate further analysis and promote reproducible research practices.

Abstract: This technical note presents a reproducible workflow for converting a legacy archaeological image collection into a structured and segmentation ready dataset. The case study focuses on the Lower Palaeolithic hand axe and biface collection curated by the Archaeology Data Service (ADS), a dataset that provides thousands of standardised photographs but no mechanism for bulk download or automated processing. To address this, two open source tools were developed: a web scraping script that retrieves all record pages, extracts associated metadata, and downloads the available images while respecting ADS Terms of Use and ethical scraping guidelines; and an image processing pipeline that renames files using UUIDs, generates binary masks and bounding boxes through classical computer vision, and stores all derived information in a COCO compatible Json file enriched with archaeological metadata. The original images are not redistributed, and only derived products such as masks, outlines, and annotations are shared. Together, these components provide a lightweight and reusable approach for transforming web based archaeological image collections into machine learning friendly formats, facilitating downstream analysis and contributing to more reproducible research practices in digital archaeology.

### [692] [Embedding-Based Rankings of Educational Resources based on Learning Outcome Alignment: Benchmarking, Expert Validation, and Learner Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13658)
*Mohammadreza Molavi,Mohammad Moein,Mohammadreza Tavakoli,Abdolali Faraji,Stefan T. Mol,Gábor Kismihók*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that leverages LLM-based text embedding models to automate the evaluation of alignment between educational resources and learning outcomes, achieving reliable performance and supporting scalable personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for personalization in online education is increasing, but selecting appropriate materials for diverse learners poses challenges for educators. Verifying alignment of materials with learning outcomes is resource-intensive, limiting scalability.

Method: The authors benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models on human-generated materials and identified the most accurate model. They applied it to evaluate LLM-generated resources, validated its performance through expert assessment, and examined the relationship between alignment scores and learning outcomes in an experimental setting.

Result: The most accurate text-embedding model achieved 79% accuracy on human-created resources and 83% accuracy on LLM-generated content. Additionally, higher alignment scores were significantly associated with improved learning performance in a large-scale experiment.

Conclusion: This framework shows that embedding-based alignment scores can enhance scalable personalization, enabling teachers to focus on diversifying and tailoring content while ensuring alignment with intended outcomes.

Abstract: As the online learning landscape evolves, the need for personalization is increasingly evident. Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001. These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs.

### [693] [Policy-Aligned Estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13400)
*Artem Timoshenko,Caio Waisman*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for estimating customer treatment effects to optimize marketing targeting policies by aligning estimation with profit objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms aim to improve marketing personalization and incremental profits by accurately identifying customers with distinct treatment effects.

Method: The proposed method adjusts the firm's profit maximization objective function to prioritize accuracy near the decision boundary and optimize treatment effect estimation (CATEs).

Result: Theoretical properties of the method were established, and its effectiveness was validated using synthetic data.

Conclusion: This approach redefines CATE estimation by integrating profit optimization, providing near-optimal targeting policies for marketing.

Abstract: Firms often develop targeting policies to personalize marketing actions and improve incremental profits. Effective targeting depends on accurately separating customers with positive versus negative treatment effects. We propose an approach to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) of marketing actions that aligns their estimation with the firm's profit objective. The method recognizes that, for many customers, treatment effects are so extreme that additional accuracy is unlikely to change the recommended actions. However, accuracy matters near the decision boundary, as small errors can alter targeting decisions. By modifying the firm's objective function in the standard profit maximization problem, our method yields a near-optimal targeting policy while simultaneously estimating CATEs. This introduces a new perspective on CATE estimation, reframing it as a problem of profit optimization rather than prediction accuracy. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed method and demonstrate its performance and trade-offs using synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend and evaluate the effectiveness of combining Multi-Frequency Echo State Networks (MFESNs) to improve macroeconomic time series forecasting.

Method: The study employs Hedge and Follow-the-Leader ensemble techniques, discussing their theoretical guarantees even with dependent data, and tests these ensembles empirically.

Result: The Ensemble Echo State Networks demonstrate significantly better predictive performance than individual MFESNs in forecasting applications.

Conclusion: Utilizing ensemble methods for MFESNs leads to superior forecasting accuracy, supporting the efficacy of model combination strategies.

Abstract: Model combination is a powerful approach to achieve superior performance with a set of models than by just selecting any single one. We study both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of ensembles of Multi-Frequency Echo State Networks (MFESNs), which have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art macroeconomic time series forecasting results (Ballarin et al., 2024a). Hedge and Follow-the-Leader schemes are discussed, and their online learning guarantees are extended to the case of dependent data. In applications, our proposed Ensemble Echo State Networks show significantly improved predictive performance compared to individual MFESN models.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study presents AION-Search, a semantic search engine for galaxy images using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and multimodal astronomy foundation models to enable scalable and flexible searching across vast, unlabeled datasets effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of manual labeling and unlock the potential for large-scale exploration of billions of galaxy images obtained from telescopes.

Method: The method involves applying Vision-Language Models to generate descriptions for images, then using a multimodal astronomy foundation model to align search embeddings contrastively for semantic image search.

Result: AION-Search achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance in finding rare phenomena, surpassing direct image similarity searches and supporting flexible semantic queries on a vast dataset of 140 million galaxy images.

Conclusion: AION-Search enhances the exploration of unlabeled scientific image archives by introducing scalable semantic search, advancing data accessibility in astronomy and other scientific fields, with open-source resources for broader application.

Abstract: Finding scientifically interesting phenomena through slow, manual labeling campaigns severely limits our ability to explore the billions of galaxy images produced by telescopes. In this work, we develop a pipeline to create a semantic search engine from completely unlabeled image data. Our method leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate descriptions for galaxy images, then contrastively aligns a pre-trained multimodal astronomy foundation model with these embedded descriptions to produce searchable embeddings at scale. We find that current VLMs provide descriptions that are sufficiently informative to train a semantic search model that outperforms direct image similarity search. Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases. Furthermore, we introduce a VLM-based re-ranking method that nearly doubles the recall for our most challenging targets in the top-100 results. For the first time, AION-Search enables flexible semantic search scalable to 140 million galaxy images, enabling discovery from previously infeasible searches. More broadly, our work provides an approach for making large, unlabeled scientific image archives semantically searchable, expanding data exploration capabilities in fields from Earth observation to microscopy.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores the adoption of standardized pre-trained CNN architectures for alert classification in time-domain astronomy, demonstrating their performance and efficiency advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and performance of alert classification models in time-domain astronomy by leveraging advancements in computer vision.

Method: The study compares various pre-training regimens and standardized architectures against custom CNNs typically used for alert classification.

Result: Standardized pre-trained architectures match or outperform custom CNNs, with Galaxy Zoo pre-training showing better performance than ImageNet. These architectures are also more optimized for time and memory usage.

Conclusion: The research advocates for the use of standardized pre-trained models to improve performance and efficiency in time-domain astronomy, signaling a shift in model creation practices for future surveys.

Abstract: Modern wide-field time-domain surveys facilitate the study of transient, variable and moving phenomena by conducting image differencing and relaying alerts to their communities. Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field.

### [697] [V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12284)
*Donghyuk Kim,Sejeong Yang,Wonjin Shin,Joo-Young Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces V-Rex, an innovative co-designed software-hardware accelerator that addresses challenges in memory and computational inefficiencies for streaming video LLMs used in real-time multimodal tasks, especially for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming video LLMs like video captioning, question answering, and augmented reality face memory and computation bottlenecks due to continuously growing key-value (KV) caches, especially during the iterative prefill stage. This is particularly challenging for resource-limited edge deployments.

Method: The authors propose V-Rex, which includes a novel KV cache retrieval algorithm called ReSV, leveraging token clustering techniques based on temporal and spatial similarities. Additionally, V-Rex incorporates a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE) hardware mechanism with bit-level and early-exit computing units.

Result: V-Rex achieves real-time processing speeds of 3.9-8.3 FPS, substantially improves efficiency with up to 19.7x speedup, and requires significantly less energy compared to AGX Orin GPU, all while incurring negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: V-Rex effectively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. It ensures real-time performance and superior energy efficiency on edge devices, making it a pioneering solution for KV cache retrieval in this domain.

Abstract: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.
  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A unified CT reconstruction framework called CTO enables resolution- and sampling-agnostic imaging using rotation-equivariant discrete-continuous convolutions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in deep learning-based CT reconstruction methods that struggle to generalize across different sampling rates and resolutions, avoiding overfitting to specific acquisition setups.

Method: CTO employs rotation-equivariant discrete-continuous convolutions and learns from sinogram and image domains to achieve generalization in the reconstruction tasks.

Result: CTO achieves consistent multi-sampling-rate and cross-resolution performance, significantly surpassing CNNs and diffusion methods in PSNR and inference speed.

Conclusion: CTO provides a scalable, generalizable, and efficient solution for automated CT reconstruction, improving practicality for deployment in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) reconstructs images from a limited number of X-ray projections to reduce radiation and scanning time, which makes reconstruction an ill-posed inverse problem. Deep learning methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions but often overfit to a fixed acquisition setup, failing to generalize across sampling rates and image resolutions. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use the same learned kernels across resolutions, leading to artifacts when data resolution changes.
  We propose Computed Tomography neural Operator (CTO), a unified CT reconstruction framework that extends to continuous function space, enabling generalization (without retraining) across sampling rates and image resolutions. CTO operates jointly in the sinogram and image domains through rotation-equivariant Discrete-Continuous convolutions parametrized in the function space, making it inherently resolution- and sampling-agnostic. Empirically, CTO enables consistent multi-sampling-rate and cross-resolution performance, with on average >4dB PSNR gain over CNNs. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion methods, CTO is 500$\times$ faster in inference time with on average 3dB gain. Empirical results also validate our design choices behind CTO's sinogram-space operator learning and rotation-equivariant convolution. Overall, CTO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across sampling rates and resolutions, offering a scalable and generalizable solution that makes automated CT reconstruction more practical for deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents an ML-based bitrate ladder construction technique for video encoding that predicts VMAF scores, streamlining content adaptation with reduced computation compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve video encoding by addressing computational inefficiencies in constructing content-adaptive bitrate ladders while enhancing video quality and viewer experience under various conditions.

Method: The authors use an ML model to predict VMAF scores for compressed videos by analyzing the compression process and extracting perceptually relevant features from source videos prior to compression.

Result: The proposed framework is evaluated against prior methods on a large set of videos, showing its enhanced performance in comparison to the fixed bitrate ladder and convex hull method.

Conclusion: ML-based adaptive bitrate ladders can lead to substantial performance improvements, making video compression more efficient without exhaustive computations.

Abstract: Over the past few years, per-title and per-shot video encoding techniques have demonstrated significant gains as compared to conventional techniques such as constant CRF encoding and the fixed bitrate ladder. These techniques have demonstrated that constructing content-gnostic per-shot bitrate ladders can provide significant bitrate gains and improved Quality of Experience (QoE) for viewers under various network conditions. However, constructing a convex hull for every video incurs a significant computational overhead. Recently, machine learning-based bitrate ladder construction techniques have emerged as a substitute for convex hull construction. These methods operate by extracting features from source videos to train machine learning (ML) models to construct content-adaptive bitrate ladders. Here, we present a new ML-based bitrate ladder construction technique that accurately predicts the VMAF scores of compressed videos, by analyzing the compression procedure and by making perceptually relevant measurements on the source videos prior to compression. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against leading prior methods on a large corpus of videos. Since training ML models on every encoder setting is time-consuming, we also investigate how per-shot bitrate ladders perform under different encoding settings. We evaluate the performance of all models against the fixed bitrate ladder and the best possible convex hull constructed using exhaustive encoding with Bjontegaard-delta metrics.

*Youssef Megahed,Inok Lee,Robin Ducharme,Kevin Dick,Adrian D. C. Chan,Steven Hawken,Mark C. Walker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model for automated prenatal renal anomaly classification, achieving significant improvements in accuracy over traditional baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to overcome the limitations of operator dependence and suboptimal imaging in prenatal ultrasound for detecting kidney and urinary tract congenital anomalies.

Method: The study fine-tunes a pre-trained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) for binary and multi-class classification tasks using a dataset of 969 ultrasound images, comparing the results with DenseNet-169 baseline using cross-validation and independent test sets.

Result: The USF-MAE model demonstrated consistent performance improvements over the DenseNet-169 baseline, with notable gains in AUC (up to 16.28%) and F1-score (up to 46.15%), especially in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that self-supervised learning tailored for ultrasound imaging provides a robust and interpretable method to enhance prenatal detection of renal anomalies, paving the way for broader applications of foundation models in obstetric imaging.

Abstract: Prenatal ultrasound is the cornerstone for detecting congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, but diagnosis is limited by operator dependence and suboptimal imaging conditions. We sought to assess the performance of a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model for automated fetal renal anomaly classification using a curated dataset of 969 two-dimensional ultrasound images. A pretrained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) was fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification of normal kidneys, urinary tract dilation, and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Models were compared with a DenseNet-169 convolutional baseline using cross-validation and an independent test set. USF-MAE consistently improved upon the baseline across all evaluation metrics in both binary and multi-class settings. USF-MAE achieved an improvement of about 1.87% (AUC) and 7.8% (F1-score) on the validation set, 2.32% (AUC) and 4.33% (F1-score) on the independent holdout test set. The largest gains were observed in the multi-class setting, where the improvement in AUC was 16.28% and 46.15% in F1-score. To facilitate model interpretability, Score-CAM visualizations were adapted for a transformer architecture and show that model predictions were informed by known, clinically relevant renal structures, including the renal pelvis in urinary tract dilation and cystic regions in multicystic dysplastic kidney. These results show that ultrasound-specific self-supervised learning can generate a useful representation as a foundation for downstream diagnostic tasks. The proposed framework offers a robust, interpretable approach to support the prenatal detection of renal anomalies and demonstrates the promise of foundation models in obstetric imaging.

*Trevor McClain,Rahul Bhadani*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the IDM car-following model and explores traffic dynamics like congestion and stop-and-go waves, demonstrating that the Followerstopper controller stabilizes traffic flow in mixed-autonomy setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how traffic congestion and stop-and-go waves form from a dynamical systems perspective and whether these phenomena can be mitigated in mixed-autonomy settings using a controlled vehicle.

Method: Analyzing the effects of delay on traffic dynamics through simulations of IDM and Followerstopper models in ring road setups and comparing traffic stability with varying scenarios.

Result: Followerstopper-controlled vehicles eliminate stop-and-go waves, stabilize the uniform flow manifold in IDM traffic, and prevent wave formation even in scenarios with known delays.

Conclusion: A single vehicle using the Followerstopper controller effectively prevents traffic congestion and stabilizes mixed traffic systems, even under time-delay conditions.

Abstract: This paper examines the IDM microscopic car-following model from a dynamical systems perspective, analyzing the effects of delay on congestion formation. Further, a case of mixed-autonomy is considered by controlling one car with Followerstopper in a ring road setting containing IDM vehicles as human drivers. Specifically, the stop-and-go waves phenomenon in idealized traffic from a dynamical systems perspective is examined. We show that Followerstopper-controlled vehicle is effective at eliminating emergent stop-and-go waves in the IDM traffic simulation. We show through simulation that the uniform flow manifold is unstable for the ring road simulation with IDM vehicles, and that replacing a single car with Followerstopper induces stability, allowing the cars to drive safely at a uniform speed. Additionally, the case of known delay is considered in a mixed-autonomy scenario. Our simulation result shows that while considering a known time delay, traffic waves emerge earlier than in the no-delay case. At the same time, a single-vehicle controlled using Followerstopper controller is able to prevent the emergence of traffic waves even in the presence of delay.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing nonlinear control methods (such as High-Order CBFs), particularly in ensuring efficient safety and stability for systems with higher-order complexity.

Method: The authors utilize Taylor's theorem with Lagrange remainder to expand safety or stability functions over time. They develop a control framework, termed TLC, which reformulates constraints as a sequence of quadratic programs with event-triggered control for practical implementation.

Result: TLC provides necessary and sufficient conditions for safety, is applicable to systems with arbitrary relative degrees, and avoids the restrictive forward invariance constraints in HOCBFs. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to adaptive cruise control and robot control systems.

Conclusion: TLC improves upon traditional CBF and CLF methods, extending their applicability and efficiency, particularly for higher-order systems. The proposed method is validated to be less restrictive and maintains safety and stability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method for nonlinear control systems to ensure the safety and stability through Taylor's theorem with Lagrange remainder. To achieve this, we expand a safety or stability function with respect to time along the system dynamics using the Lie derivative and Taylor's theorem. This expansion enables the control input to appear in the Taylor series at an order equivalent to the relative degree of the function. We show that the proposed TLC provides necessary and sufficient conditions for system safety and is applicable to systems and constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The TLC exhibits connections with existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) methods, and it further extends the CBF and CLF methods to the complex domain, especially for higher order cases. Compared to High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), TLC is less restrictive as it does not require forward invariance of the intersection of a set of safe sets while HOCBFs do. We employ TLC to reformulate a constrained optimal control problem as a sequence of quadratic programs with a zero-order hold implementation method, and demonstrate the safety of zero-order hold TLC using an event-triggered control method to address inter-sampling effects. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TLC method through an adaptive cruise control system and a robot control problem, and compare it with existing CBF methods.

### [703] [High Order Control Lyapunov Function - Control Barrier Function - Quadratic Programming Based Autonomous Driving Controller for Bicyclist Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12776)
*Haochong Chen,Xincheng Cao,Levent Guvenc,Bilin Aksun-Guvenc*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper develops a robust control framework (HOCLF HOCBF QP) to improve bicyclist safety in autonomous driving, simulating crash scenarios and demonstrating its effectiveness in avoiding collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring bicyclist safety in autonomous driving systems, given their unique characteristics such as predictable movements and clear traffic rules but high relative speeds that make collision avoidance difficult.

Method: A High Order Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and High Order Control Barrier Function (CBF) Quadratic Programming (QP) framework was developed. CLFs ensure system stability for trajectory tracking while CBFs ensure safety by maintaining collision-free states. A QP solver optimally combines these objectives.

Result: The study recreated three bicyclist crash scenarios from the FARS database to evaluate the approach. Simulation results showed that the proposed control framework ensures robust, collision-free maneuvers for autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: The HOCLF HOCBF QP framework can improve bicyclist safety in complex traffic situations, offering a feasible method for enhancing autonomous driving systems' safety performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge in the development of advanced autonomous driving systems in smart cities. Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments.

*Semih Kara,Yasin Sonmez,Can Kizilkale,Alex Kurzhanskiy,Nuno C. Martins,Murat Arcak*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce traffic congestion using equilibrium models and demonstrates the effectiveness of a greedy station-placement algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the potential traffic congestion caused by unplanned EV charger placements, which could hinder the benefits of EV adoption.

Method: The authors use congestion-game and atomic queueing simulation equilibrium models, embedding them in a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm to strategically determine charger placement.

Result: The greedy algorithm achieves optimal or near-optimal congestion results in realistic networks despite some limitations in global optimality. Additionally, the queueing-based modeling is shown to produce more realistic outcomes than the congestion-game approach.

Conclusion: The study presents a practical congestion-alleviating EV charger placement solution, combining equilibrium models and queueing-based calibration to tackle traffic congestion effectively.

Abstract: Growing EV adoption can worsen traffic conditions if chargers are sited without regard to their impact on congestion. We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-powered scoring system employing sensor fusion and machine learning to address challenges in Olympic Taekwondo scoring and improve gameplay dynamism and spectator engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Olympic Taekwondo struggles with static gameplay and contentious scoring due to the limitations of existing Protector and Scoring Systems (PSS), which encourage passive strategies.

Method: The system integrates sensor fusion using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic/RFID, and impact force sensors, combined with machine learning (SVMs) to classify kick techniques in real-time for scoring.

Result: A validation study demonstrates 96-98% accuracy for kick classification, proving the feasibility of real-time scoring. Recommendations are made to improve accuracy further with ensemble SVM classifiers and expanded datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances scoring fairness, promotes dynamic techniques, discourages rule exploitation, and improves spectator engagement, ultimately modernizing Olympic Taekwondo gameplay.

Abstract: Olympic Taekwondo has faced challenges in spectator engagement due to static, defensive gameplay and contentious scoring. Current Protector and Scoring Systems (PSS) rely on impact sensors and simplistic logic, encouraging safe strategies that diminish the sport's dynamism. This paper proposes an AI-powered scoring system that integrates existing PSS sensors with additional accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic/RFID, and impact force sensors in a sensor fusion framework. The system classifies kicks in real-time to identify technique type, contact location, impact force, and even the part of the foot used. A machine learning pipeline employing sensor fusion and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is detailed, enabling automatic kick technique recognition for scoring. We present a novel kick scoring rubric that awards points based on specific kick techniques (e.g., turning and spinning kicks) to incentivize dynamic attacks. Drawing on a 2024 study achieving 96-98% accuracy, we validate the feasibility of real-time kick classification and further propose enhancements to this methodology, such as ensemble SVM classifiers and expanded datasets, to achieve the high-stakes accuracy required by the sport. We analyze how the proposed system can improve scoring fairness, reduce rule exploitation and illegitimate tactics, encourage more dynamic techniques, and enhance spectator understanding and excitement. The paper includes system design illustrations, a kick scoring table from an AI-augmented rule set, and discusses anticipated impacts on Olympic Taekwondo.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework integrating forecasting and robust optimization to improve microgrid management under uncertainty, reducing costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microgrids face uncertainty and operational challenges due to renewable energy sources' variability, requiring better forecasting and decision-making integration.

Method: An integrated probabilistic forecasting model (MED) and two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) are linked through gradient-based feedback to improve decision-focused performance.

Result: Case studies show the framework improves forecasting, enhances operational performance, and reduces costs by up to 18% compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: This framework effectively manages microgrid operations under uncertainty, proving scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient.

Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.

*Haoyang Shang,Zhengyang Yan,Xuan Liu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative matching framework, focusing on simulating interactions ahead of compatibility assessment using LLMs as persona-driven agents and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of computational matching rely on static profile comparisons, which fail to account for dynamic interpersonal relationship factors.

Method: Utilizing LLMs as agents and environmental engines to simulate behavioral responses, compatibility is modeled as a reward-based problem. The framework incorporates psychological principles and mathematical formulations to assess dynamic relationship compatibility.

Result: Theoretical findings show that LLMs approximating human behavior lead to optimal stable matches. Empirical tests on speed dating and divorce prediction data validate the model's accuracy for compatibility assessment.

Conclusion: This framework revolutionizes matching systems by emphasizing personalized, interactive, and dynamic compatibility assessments through simulation, paving the way for more transparent and compelling systems.

Abstract: We propose Love First, Know Later: a paradigm shift in computational matching that simulates interactions first, then assesses compatibility. Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of collaborating with probabilistic, semi-autonomous agents in a way that builds trust, transparency, and ease of interaction.

Method: HAX integrates behavioral heuristics, a structured SDK for safe outputs, and design patterns that enhance usability, supported by TIP theory and a validated catalog.

Result: The framework successfully introduces tools and design principles for mixed-initiative collaboration, agent coordination, and trust-building in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: HAX is an end-to-end framework that bridges theoretical, design, and technical aspects to support effective human-AI collaboration in the growing Internet of Agents.

Abstract: The rise of generative and autonomous agents marks a fundamental shift in computing, demanding a rethinking of how humans collaborate with probabilistic, partially autonomous systems. We present the Human-AI-Experience (HAX) framework, a comprehensive, three-phase approach that establishes design foundations for trustworthy, transparent, and collaborative agentic interaction. HAX integrates behavioral heuristics, a schema-driven SDK enforcing structured and safe outputs, and a behavioral proxy concept that orchestrates agent activity to reduce cognitive load. A validated catalog of mixed-initiative design patterns further enables intent preview, iterative alignment, trust repair, and multi-agent narrative coherence. Grounded in Time, Interaction, and Performance (TIP) theory, HAX reframes multi-agent systems as colleagues, offering the first end-to-end framework that bridges trust theory, interface design, and infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents.

TL;DR: The study explored the integration of generative AI as a collaborative tool in classrooms, involving teachers and students over seven weeks, using AI features like Teaching Aide and AI Tutor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how generative AI can function as an active, mediating agent in classrooms and extend instructional capacities without compromising human judgment.

Method: 21 teachers co-designed activities using AI-powered classroom features, implementing them with 600 students across various schools, iteratively improving the platform through feedback.

Result: Teachers identified both instructional benefits and areas requiring refinement for AI, based on a diverse set of data sources including surveys, interviews, and usage logs.

Conclusion: AI can serve as a valuable educational tool when carefully integrated, guided by teacher-led design and continuous iteration based on classroom feedback.

Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive account of the Colleague AI Classroom pilot, a collaborative design (co-design) study that brought generative AI technology directly into real classrooms. In this study, AI functioned as a third agent, an active participant that mediated feedback, supported inquiry, and extended teachers' instructional reach while preserving human judgment and teacher authority.
  Over seven weeks in spring 2025, 21 in-service teachers from four Washington State public school districts and one independent school integrated four AI-powered features of the Colleague AI Classroom into their instruction: Teaching Aide, Assessment and AI Grading, AI Tutor, and Student Growth Insights. More than 600 students in grades 6-12 used the platform in class at the direction of their teachers, who designed and facilitated the AI activities.
  During the Classroom pilot, teachers were co-design partners: they planned activities, implemented them with students, and provided weekly reflections on AI's role in classroom settings. The teachers' feedback guided iterative improvements for Colleague AI. The research team captured rich data through surveys, planning and reflection forms, group meetings, one-on-one interviews, and platform usage logs to understand where AI adds instructional value and where it requires refinement.

TL;DR: The paper challenges the notion of large language models (LLMs) being mere data reproductions, showing their ability to create conceptual structures and engage in reflective and creative interactions in appropriate contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models are capable of developing meaningful interactions and conceptual coherence, instead of merely reproducing training data.

Method: Analyzed AI-generated philosophical debates using digital versions of notable philosophers in interactive art installations, drawing on cloning principles and the maieutic method.

Result: Demonstrated that LLMs can engage in reflective questioning, creative synthesis, and inferential coherence during machine-human dialogue.

Conclusion: Proposes the concept of the 'Epistemoverse,' a collaborative metaverse for knowledge exchange and intellectual heritage preservation through AI-human interaction in virtual environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have often been characterized as "stochastic parrots" that merely reproduce fragments of their training data. This study challenges that assumption by demonstrating that, when placed in an appropriate dialogical context, LLMs can develop emergent conceptual structures and exhibit interaction-driven (re-)structuring of cognitive interfaces and reflective question-asking. Drawing on the biological principle of cloning and Socrates' maieutic method, we analyze authentic philosophical debates generated among AI-reincarnated philosophers within the interactive art installations of the Syntropic Counterpoints project. By engaging digital counterparts of Aristotle, Nietzsche, Machiavelli, and Sun Tzu in iterative discourse, the study reveals how machine dialogue can give rise to inferential coherence, reflective questioning, and creative synthesis. Based on these findings, we propose the concept of the Epistemoverse--a metaverse of knowledge where human and machine cognition intersect to preserve, reinterpret, and extend intellectual heritage through AI-driven interaction. This framework positions virtual and immersive environments as new spaces for epistemic exchange, digital heritage, and collaborative creativity.

*Jiangen He,Jiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Researchers conducted a user experiment comparing four source citation formats in conversational search systems, finding that high-visibility formats influenced source use behaviors but initially reduced knowledge gain and interest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how source citation formats in conversational search systems impact user engagement, knowledge, and perception.

Method: A crowdsourcing experiment with 394 participants tested four source citation designs varying visibility and accessibility.

Result: High-visibility designs increased source hovering but not clicking. Such designs initially reduced knowledge gain and interest but improved outcomes with increased source usage.

Conclusion: Source presentation alone is insufficient for engagement optimization and may reduce it when citations are limited.

Abstract: Conversational search systems increasingly provide source citations, yet how citation or source presentation formats influence user engagement remains unclear. We conducted a crowdsourcing user experiment with 394 participants comparing four source presentation designs that varied citation visibility and accessibility: collapsible lists, hover cards, footer lists, and aligned sidebars.High-visibility interfaces generated substantially more hovering on sources, though clicking remained infrequent across all conditions. While interface design showed limited effects on user experience and perception measures, it significantly influenced knowledge, interest, and agreement changes. High-visibility interfaces initially reduced knowledge gain and interest, but these positive effects emerged with increasing source usage. The sidebar condition uniquely increased agreement change. Our findings demonstrate that source presentation alone may not enhance engagement and can even reduce it when insufficient sources are provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the opacity of AI algorithms in medical diagnosis by exploring how explainable AI (XAI) can assist users while identifying potential pitfalls like over-reliance or bias.

Method: Two large-scale experiments were conducted involving 623 lay users and 153 primary care physicians (PCPs), utilizing a fairness-based diagnosis AI model with XAI explanations to assess diagnostic performance under different conditions.

Result: AI assistance balanced across skin tones improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced disparities. However, LLM explanations led to higher automation bias among lay users, while PCPs showed resilience. Presenting AI suggestions first worsened outcomes when the AI erred for both groups.

Conclusion: XAI, particularly multimodal LLMs, impacts diagnostic outcomes differently based on expertise levels and timing, revealing its dual-edged potential in medical applications and advocating for careful design in human-AI collaboration systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating healthcare, from physician assistants to consumer applications. Since AI algorithm's opacity challenges human interaction, explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by providing AI decision-making insight, but evidence suggests XAI can paradoxically induce over-reliance or bias. We present results from two large-scale experiments (623 lay people; 153 primary care physicians, PCPs) combining a fairness-based diagnosis AI model and different XAI explanations to examine how XAI assistance, particularly multimodal large language models (LLMs), influences diagnostic performance. AI assistance balanced across skin tones improved accuracy and reduced diagnostic disparities. However, LLM explanations yielded divergent effects: lay users showed higher automation bias - accuracy boosted when AI was correct, reduced when AI erred - while experienced PCPs remained resilient, benefiting irrespective of AI accuracy. Presenting AI suggestions first also led to worse outcomes when the AI was incorrect for both groups. These findings highlight XAI's varying impact based on expertise and timing, underscoring LLMs as a "double-edged sword" in medical AI and informing future human-AI collaborative system design.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how agents can aid lower-SES older adults in aging-in-place by addressing cognitive decline and caregiver burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore solutions that allow older adults with cognitive decline to remain in their homes while reducing the burden on informal caregivers.

Method: Interviews with ten pairs of older adults with cognitive decline and their caregivers to study their care coordination, challenges, and autonomy maintenance.

Result: Findings reveal that older adults delegate specific tasks, hide care details from their children, and compromise daily living quality to lessen caregiver burden. Piggybacking errands emerged as an effective care strategy.

Conclusion: The study proposes exploring agent-based solutions to support piggybacking coordination, potentially extending aging-in-place without increasing caregiver strain.

Abstract: The increasing number of older adults who experience cognitive decline places a burden on informal caregivers, whose support with tasks of daily living determines whether older adults can remain in their homes. To explore how agents might help lower-SES older adults to age-in-place, we interviewed ten pairs of older adults experiencing cognitive decline and their informal caregivers. We explored how they coordinate care, manage burdens, and sustain autonomy and privacy. Older adults exercised control by delegating tasks to specific caregivers, keeping information about all the care they received from their adult children. Many abandoned some tasks of daily living, lowering their quality of life to ease caregiver burden. One effective strategy, piggybacking, uses spontaneous overlaps in errands to get more work done with less caregiver effort. This raises the questions: (i) Can agents help with piggyback coordination? (ii) Would it keep older adults in their homes longer, while not increasing caregiver burden?

Method: Developing and testing ORIBA, a chatbot powered by large language models, which facilitates role-playing with OCs and emphasizes conceptual tasks like backstory creation.

Result: A study with 14 artists revealed ORIBA motivated their imaginative engagement, helping them build deeper character attributes and foster stronger connections with their OCs.

Conclusion: Generative AI, when designed thoughtfully, can serve as a neutral, supportive tool that respects artists’ creative agency, advancing artistic processes without intruding on visual aspects of their work.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GAI) have led to new opportunities for creativity support. However, this technology has raised ethical concerns in the visual artists community. This paper explores how GAI can assist visual artists in developing original characters (OCs) while respecting their creative agency. We present ORIBA, an AI chatbot leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enable artists to role-play with their OCs, focusing on conceptualization (e.g., backstories) while leaving exposition (visual creation) to creators. Through a study with 14 artists, we found ORIBA motivated artists' imaginative engagement, developing multidimensional attributes and stronger bonds with OCs that inspire their creative process. Our contributions include design insights for AI systems that develop from artists' perspectives, demonstrating how LLMs can support cross-modal creativity while preserving creative agency in OC art. This paper highlights the potential of GAI as a neutral, non-visual support that strengthens existing creative practice, without infringing artistic exposition.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing integration of autonomous vehicles into transport systems and the need for user-friendly and trustworthy interfaces to enhance acceptance.

Method: The study uses strategies like adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and user feedback mechanisms, emphasizing transparency and user control.

Result: The research identifies that personalized interfaces significantly enhance user engagement, satisfaction, and trust in autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: Personalized HCI-based interfaces are vital for autonomous vehicles to meet varied user needs, while emphasizing safety and maintaining user control and transparency.

Abstract: With the recent development and integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in transportation systems of the modern world, the emphasis on customizing user interfaces to optimize the overall user experience has been growing expediently. Therefore, understanding user needs and preferences is essential to the acceptance and trust of these technologies as they continue to grow in prevalence. This paper addresses the implementation of HCI principles in the personalization of interfaces to improve safety, security, and usability for the users. This paper explores the way that personalized interfaces can be devised to increase user engagement and satisfaction through various HCI strategies such as adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and user feedback mechanisms. Moreover, this paper puts emphasis on factors of transparency and user control in the design of an interface; hence, allowing users to design or modify their experience could foster an increase in trust in autonomous systems. In so doing, this research touches on the quite influential role HCI will play in this future scenario of autonomous vehicles while designing to ensure relevance to the diverse needs of users while maintaining high standards of safety and security. Discussing various HCI strategies such as adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and feedback mechanisms to the user, this paper demonstrates how personalized interfaces can enhance significantly both user engagement and satisfaction. Transparency and user control also in designing an interface are further discussed, pointing out the need for a prerequisite condition of enabling the user to take control of their experience as a state of trust in autonomous systems. In summary, this paper points out the role of HCI in the development of autonomous vehicles and addresses numerous needs with respect to those enforced safety and security standards.

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4 to generate argumentation evidence cards for debates, comparing them with student-created cards based on rhetorical principles like ethos, pathos, and logos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of the labor-intensive, human-led training for debate argumentation by leveraging AI to enhance scalability and effectiveness.

Method: GPT-4 was prompted to create evidence cards, encompassing literary evidence, summaries, scripts, and titles, and was compared qualitatively and quantitatively to student-created cards using Aristotle’s rhetorical principles.

Result: The study provides an analysis of GPT-4's and students' strengths and limitations in forming arguments while revealing where AI matches or diverges from human reasoning.

Conclusion: This research advances understanding of AI's role in learning by showing how GPT-4 can support and complement student debate preparation and critical thinking skill development.

Abstract: Debate has been widely adopted as a strategy to enhance critical thinking skills in English Language Arts (ELA). One important skill in debate is forming effective argumentation, which requires debaters to select supportive evidence from literature and construct compelling claims. However, the training of this skill largely depends on human coaching, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To better support students in preparing for debates, this study explores the potential of leveraging artificial intelligence to generate effective arguments. Specifically, we prompted GPT-4 to create an evidence card and compared it to those produced by human debaters. The evidence cards outline the arguments students will present and how those arguments will be delivered, including components such as literature-based evidence quotations, summaries of core ideas, verbatim reading scripts, and tags (i.e., titles of the arguments). We compared the quality of the arguments in the evidence cards created by GPT and student debaters using Aristotle's rhetorical principles: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logical reasoning). Through a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis, grounded in the rhetorical principles, we identify the strengths and limitations of human and GPT in debate reasoning, outlining areas where AI's focus and justifications align with or diverge from human reasoning. Our findings contribute to the evolving role of AI-assisted learning interventions, offering insights into how student debaters can develop strategies that enhance their argumentation and reasoning skills.

### [718] [Cargo Sherlock: An SMT-Based Checker for Software Trust Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12553)
*Muhammad Hassnain,Anirudh Basu,Ethan Ng,Caleb Stanford*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal framework for assessing trust in third-party software dependencies, emphasizing formal methods and human factors, and implements it in a tool for Rust libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing threat of supply chain attacks in open-source software ecosystems by quantifying trust in software dependencies based on both formal methods and human-centric metadata.

Method: Proposed a formal framework using SMT to quantify trust in software dependencies by combining code analysis and metadata. Developed 'Cargo Sherlock,' a tool for Rust libraries, using a first-order relational model and the minimum trust problem.

Result: The Cargo Sherlock tool detects synthetic supply chain attacks and incidents with compromised Rust crates. It also demonstrated scalability, effectively handling libraries with large dependency networks.

Conclusion: Incorporating formal methods and human-centric trust metrics can effectively enhance supply chain security in open-source ecosystems. The proposed solution can identify and mitigate risks in software dependencies.

Abstract: Supply chain attacks threaten open-source software ecosystems. This paper proposes a formal framework for quantifying trust in third-party software dependencies that is both formally checkable - formalized in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) - while at the same time incorporating human factors, like the number of downloads, authors, and other metadata that are commonly used to identify trustworthy software in practice. We use data from both software analysis tools and metadata to build a first-order relational model of software dependencies; to obtain an overall "trust cost" combining these factors, we propose a formalization based on the minimum trust problem which asks for the minimum cost of a set of assumptions which can be used to prove that the code is safe. We implement these ideas in Cargo Sherlock, targeted for Rust libraries (crates), incorporating a list of candidate assumptions motivated by quantifiable trust metrics identified in prior work. Our evaluation shows that Cargo Sherlock can be used to identify synthetically generated supply chain attacks and known incidents involving typosquatted and poorly AI-maintained crates, and that its performance scales to Rust crates with many dependencies.

*Yoo Yongmin,Kim Seungwoo,Liu Jingjiang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERA-IT, a framework that aligns LLMs with economic realities to predict the value of patents under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to value patents due to information asymmetry and systemic delays in data like citation counts, creating challenges in technological innovation management.

Method: The proposed ERA-IT leverages patent renewal data as economic signals to train LLMs for predicting patent values and generating logical rationales. It involves Eco-Semantic Alignment.

Result: ERA-IT outperforms traditional econometric models and zero-shot LLMs, offering better predictions of patent value and providing transparent rationales for decision-making.

Conclusion: ERA-IT resolves the opacity of AI in intellectual property valuation, improving predictive accuracy and aiding strategic innovation management with logical and interpretable outputs.

Abstract: Valuing intangible assets under uncertainty remains a critical challenge in the strategic management of technological innovation due to the information asymmetry inherent in high-dimensional technical specifications. Traditional bibliometric indicators, such as citation counts, fail to address this friction in a timely manner due to the systemic latency inherent in data accumulation. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the Economic Reasoning Alignment via Instruction Tuning (ERA-IT) framework. We theoretically conceptualize patent renewal history as a revealed economic preference and leverage it as an objective supervisory signal to align the generative reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with market realities, a process we term Eco-Semantic Alignment. Using a randomly sampled dataset of 10,000 European Patent Office patents across diverse technological domains, we trained the model not only to predict value tiers but also to reverse-engineer the Economic Chain-of-Thought from unstructured text. Empirical results demonstrate that ERA-IT significantly outperforms both conventional econometric models and zero-shot LLMs in predictive accuracy. More importantly, by generating explicit, logically grounded rationales for valuation, the framework serves as a transparent cognitive scaffold for decision-makers, reducing the opacity of black-box AI in high-stakes intellectual property management.

*La Ode Aman,A Mu'thi Andy Suryadi,Dizky Ramadani Putri Papeo,Hamsidar Hasan,Ariani H Hutuba,Netty Ino Ischak,Yuszda K. Salimi*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: A model integrates multiple omics data and protein network embeddings with attention-based fusion to predict cancer response to therapy, achieving high accuracy using selected modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting cancer cell response to therapy using molecular data is hindered by the complexity of biological interactions, making single omics layers insufficient.

Method: The study integrates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics data with protein embeddings based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). An attention-based mechanism is used for modality fusion.

Result: Selective integration of proteomics and transcriptomics achieved the highest prediction performance for Dabrafenib sensitivity, with R2 around 0.96. Single omics and other multimodal combinations performed worse.

Conclusion: Using attention-guided multi-omics fusion coupled with GCN significantly improved prediction accuracy, providing a robust computational tool for precision oncology and drug response modeling.

Abstract: Cancer cell response to targeted therapy arises from complex molecular interactions, making single omics insufficient for accurate prediction. This study develops a model to predict Dabrafenib sensitivity by integrating multiple omics layers (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics) with protein network embeddings generated using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Each modality is encoded into low dimensional representations through neural network preprocessing. Protein interaction information from STRING is incorporated using GCN to capture biological topology. An attention based fusion mechanism assigns adaptive weights to each modality according to its relevance. Using GDSC cancer cell line data, the model shows that selective integration of two modalities, especially proteomics and transcriptomics, achieves the best test performance (R2 around 0.96), outperforming all single omics and full multimodal settings. Genomic and epigenomic data were less informative, while proteomic and transcriptomic layers provided stronger phenotypic signals related to MAPK inhibitor activity. These results show that attention guided multi omics fusion combined with GCN improves drug response prediction and reveals complementary molecular determinants of Dabrafenib sensitivity. The approach offers a promising computational framework for precision oncology and predictive modeling of targeted therapies.

*Dominik Geißler,Tobias Winkler*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper discusses using weighted automata to achieve exact inference in discrete probabilistic programs by encoding distributions over program variables. This approach utilizes automata-theoretic constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs efficiently and accurately.

Method: The authors use weighted automata to encode distributions of probabilistic program variables. By leveraging automata-theoretic constructions (e.g., product, concatenation), they establish a framework for exact inference.

Result: A novel linkage between the semantics of probabilistic programming languages and weighted automata was established, providing an exact inference mechanism.

Conclusion: Weighted automata are effective tools for performing exact inference in discrete probabilistic programs, offering a systematic approach to modeling and computation.

Abstract: Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable effective computational access to large-scale noisy historical newspaper collections despite challenges like OCR errors, multilingual variations, and temporal drifts in language.

Method: A multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with semantic query expansion, Reciprocal Rank Fusion for retrieval, engineered generation prompts, and a modular design for evaluation.

Result: The pipeline successfully delivers accurate answers for supported questions, abstains from unanswerable queries, and enhances recall stability. Ablation studies highlight key elements contributing to robust performance.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG pipeline demonstrates robustness in answering questions from historical documents, offering a reproducible foundation for addressing vocabulary and evidence-based QA challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale digitization initiatives have unlocked massive collections of historical newspapers, yet effective computational access remains hindered by OCR corruption, multilingual orthographic variation, and temporal language drift. We develop and evaluate a multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline specifically designed for question answering on noisy historical documents. Our approach integrates: (i) semantic query expansion and multi-query fusion using Reciprocal Rank Fusion to improve retrieval robustness against vocabulary mismatch; (ii) a carefully engineered generation prompt that enforces strict grounding in retrieved evidence and explicit abstention when evidence is insufficient; and (iii) a modular architecture enabling systematic component evaluation. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on Named Entity Recognition and embedding model selection, demonstrating the importance of syntactic coherence in entity extraction and balanced performance-efficiency trade-offs in dense retrieval. Our end-to-end evaluation framework shows that the pipeline generates faithful answers for well-supported queries while correctly abstaining from unanswerable questions. The hybrid retrieval strategy improves recall stability, particularly benefiting from RRF's ability to smooth performance variance across query formulations. We release our code and configurations at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RAGs-C5AE/, providing a reproducible foundation for robust historical document question answering.

*Nathaniel H. Park,Eduardo Soares,Victor Y. Shirasuna,Tiffany J. Callahan,Sara Capponi,Emilio Vital Brazil*

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: This paper introduces a SMILES-based polymer graph representation for modeling polymers, achieving strong results across benchmarks and emphasizing the need for control experiments to evaluate structure representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in developing foundation models for polymers, focusing on structural representation and addressing the lack of benchmarks and training data.

Method: A new SMILES-based polymer graph representation is developed, capturing key polymer architectural features and connectivity. The model's performance is tested through benchmarks and control experiments to compare alternative representations.

Result: The proposed model performed excellently on 28 benchmark datasets. Control experiments confirmed the model's robustness, highlighting strong invariance among SMILES representations—even chemically invalid ones.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the significance of control experiments to mitigate human bias in designing chemistry foundation models and their structural representations, ensuring more rational model development.

Abstract: From the relative scarcity of training data to the lack of standardized benchmarks, the development of foundation models for polymers face significant and multi-faceted challenges. At the core, many of these issues are tied directly to the structural representation of polymers and here, we present a new foundation model using a SMILES-based polymer graph representation. This approach allows representation of critical polymer architectural features and connectivity that are not available in other SMILES-based representations. The developed polymer foundation model exhibited excellent performance on 28 different benchmark datasets. Critical evaluation of the developed representation against other variations in control experiments reveals this approach to be a highly performant method of representing polymers in language-based foundation models. These control experiments also reveal a strong invariance of all SMILES representations, with many variations achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, including those which are chemically or semantically invalid. Examination of error sources and attention maps for the evaluated representations corroborate the findings of the control experiments, showing that chemistry language models based on SMILES interpolate over all sequence space for prediction tasks, not only those of semantically valid inputs. Overall, this work highlights the importance of control experiments as a check on human-imposed assumptions that can limit rational design of both chemistry foundation models and their underlying structural representations.

*Agustín García-García,Pablo Hidalgo,Julio E. Sandubete*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper reviews explainable AI techniques for economic time series, addresses challenges specific to time-series data, proposes a taxonomy of methods, and links explainability to policy applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to make machine-learning forecasters in computational economics interpretable for auditing and policy usage, especially given their superior forecasting performance over classical models.

Method: The paper introduces a taxonomy categorizing explainable AI methods into propagation-based, perturbation-based, and function-based approaches, and evaluates their compatibility with time-series characteristics.

Result: Time-series-specific adaptations to explanation methods improve interpretability and computational efficiency, while intrinsically interpretable AI architectures like attention-based transformers offer promise.

Conclusion: Guidance provided on decision-grade applications highlights attribution uncertainty and dynamics for structural monitoring, advancing practical use of explainable AI in economic forecasting and policymaking.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly required in computational economics, where machine-learning forecasters can outperform classical econometric models but remain difficult to audit and use for policy. This survey reviews and organizes the growing literature on XAI for economic time series, where autocorrelation, non-stationarity, seasonality, mixed frequencies, and regime shifts can make standard explanation techniques unreliable or economically implausible. We propose a taxonomy that classifies methods by (i) explanation mechanism: propagation-based approaches (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation), perturbation and game-theoretic attribution (e.g., permutation importance, LIME, SHAP), and function-based global tools (e.g., Accumulated Local Effects); (ii) time-series compatibility, including preservation of temporal dependence, stability over time, and respect for data-generating constraints. We synthesize time-series-specific adaptations such as vector- and window-based formulations (e.g., Vector SHAP, WindowSHAP) that reduce lag fragmentation and computational cost while improving interpretability. We also connect explainability to causal inference and policy analysis through interventional attributions (Causal Shapley values) and constrained counterfactual reasoning. Finally, we discuss intrinsically interpretable architectures (notably attention-based transformers) and provide guidance for decision-grade applications such as nowcasting, stress testing, and regime monitoring, emphasizing attribution uncertainty and explanation dynamics as indicators of structural change.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three pricing strategies to decrease meat consumption in campus cafeterias and assesses their effectiveness in reducing CO2 emissions and promoting vegetarian meal uptake.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the environmental impact of meat consumption by exploring effective pricing strategies in a real-world setting.

Method: The study used a sequential crossover design with different pricing interventions (discounts, surcharges, combined schemes) implemented in campus cafeterias and analyzed their impact on meal choices, emissions, and sales.

Result: The surcharge and combined schemes increased vegetarian meal uptake significantly, reducing CO2 emissions per meal. However, the surcharge caused a sales drop and spillover effects that undermined environmental benefits.

Conclusion: Balanced pricing strategies, such as a combined scheme, effectively reduce emissions without harming sales or revenue. Coordinated implementation is needed to maximize the climate benefits and avoid adverse effects.

Abstract: Meat consumption is a major driver of global greenhouse gas emissions. While pricing interventions have shown potential to reduce meat intake, previous studies have focused on highly constrained environments with limited consumer choice. Here, we present the first large-scale field experiment to evaluate multiple pricing interventions in a real-world, competitive setting. Using a sequential crossover design with matched menus in a Swiss university campus, we systematically compared vegetarian-meal discounts (-2.5 CHF), meat surcharges (+2.5 CHF), and a combined scheme (-1.2 CHF=+1.2 CHF) across four campus cafeterias. Only the surcharge and combined interventions led to significant increases in vegetarian meal uptake--by 26.4% and 16.6%, respectively--and reduced CO2 emissions per meal by 7.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The surcharge, while effective, triggered a 12.3% drop in sales at intervention sites and a corresponding 14.9% increase in non-treated locations, hence causing a spillover effect that completely offset environmental gains. In contrast, the combined approach achieved meaningful emission reductions without significant effects on overall sales or revenue, making it both effective and economically viable. Notably, pricing interventions were equally effective for both vegetarian-leaning customers and habitual meat-eaters, stimulating change even within entrenched dietary habits. Our results show that balanced pricing strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of realistic food environments, but require coordinated implementation to maximize climate benefits and avoid unintended spillover effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and optimize the resilience and adaptability of complex networks, particularly by addressing the roles of memory constraints and adversarial disruptions.

Method: The study develops a framework incorporating explicit memory decay within homophily-based models, conducting experiments using synthetic datasets to evaluate decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures like cosine and Jaccard similarity.

Result: Cosine similarity improved stability metrics by up to 30% in sparse, convex, and modular networks. The value-of-recall metric showed that strategic forgetting enhances resilience by balancing robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that aligning memory and similarity parameters with network dynamics is crucial, offering actionable insights for optimizing real-world networks across various domains such as social systems and cybersecurity.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate how homophily, memory constraints, and adversarial disruptions collectively shape the resilience and adaptability of complex networks. To achieve this, we develop a new framework that integrates explicit memory decay mechanisms into homophily-based models and systematically evaluate their performance across diverse graph structures and adversarial settings. Our methods involve extensive experimentation on synthetic datasets, where we vary decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures, primarily comparing cosine similarity with traditional metrics such as Jaccard similarity and baseline edge weights. The results show that cosine similarity achieves up to a 30\% improvement in stability metrics in sparse, convex, and modular networks. Moreover, the refined value-of-recall metric demonstrates that strategic forgetting can bolster resilience by balancing network robustness and adaptability. The findings underscore the critical importance of aligning memory and similarity parameters with the structural and adversarial dynamics of the network. By quantifying the tangible benefits of incorporating memory constraints into homophily-based analyses, this study offers actionable insights for optimizing real-world applications, including social systems, collaborative platforms, and cybersecurity contexts.

TL;DR: ASTA is an adaptive solution for speech-to-action in IoT devices, balancing cloud and edge processing using a metric-aware routing mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-offs between cloud-based and edge-based voice processing for IoT devices, balancing performance, latency, and privacy constraints.

Method: ASTA dynamically routes voice commands based on real-time metrics, integrating on-device speech recognition and lightweight inference with cloud-based LLM processing.

Result: ASTA achieves balanced distribution between online and offline inference, with a 62.5% ASR accuracy and a repair mechanism critical for improving command execution robustness.

Conclusion: Adaptive edge-cloud orchestration with ASTA improves resilience and resource efficiency in voice-controlled IoT systems.

Abstract: Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices. However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper proposes SYSSPEC, a framework leveraging LLMs to generate and evolve file systems based on precise specifications instead of ambiguous natural language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional paradigm of maintaining file systems struggles with overhead and inefficiency, particularly as complexity grows. The paper aims to address this with a generative file system approach using LLMs.

Method: SYSSPEC uses a formal specification framework over ambiguous prompts, employs DAG-structured patches for evolution, and integrates LLM-based agents to mitigate issues like hallucination.

Result: SPECFS, a functional and concurrent file system, was generated, passing tests and integrating real-world features effectively. It demonstrates the feasibility and robustness of this approach.

Conclusion: Specification-guided generative systems can effectively handle the design and evolution of complex systems, improving efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.
  This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues of missing or abnormal values in medical time series data, which require time-consuming preprocessing steps that can introduce bias and affect predictive model accuracy.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a variational auto-encoder (VAE) for preprocessing latent space generation and a recurrent VAE for preserving temporal dynamics, thereby simplifying the preprocessing process.

Result: The model was tested on telemonitoring data for glucose-level forecasting in diabetic patients and achieved improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the novel deep learning model effectively reduces preprocessing bias and enhances predictive accuracy for medical time series applications.

Abstract: Data preprocessing is a critical part of time series data analysis. Data from connected medical devices often have missing or abnormal values during acquisition. Handling such situations requires additional assumptions and domain knowledge. This can be time-consuming, and can introduce a significant bias affecting predictive model accuracy and thus, medical interpretation. To overcome this issue, we propose a new deep learning model to mitigate the preprocessing assumptions. The model architecture relies on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to produce a preprocessing latent space, and a recurrent VAE to preserve the temporal dynamics of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an architecture on telemonitoring data to forecast glucose-level of diabetic patients. Our results show an improvement in terms of accuracy with respect of existing state-of-the-art methods and architectures.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the design and performance of chiral photonic metasurfaces, which are crucial for the development of next-generation photonic devices.

Method: The study uses a refined pipeline combining a two-output neural network, improved fitness function, and data augmentation techniques. A comparison between neural networks and genetic algorithms is explored for various design complexities.

Result: The optimized framework achieved twice higher chiral dichroism and enabled better light manipulation using GaP/air and PMMA/air metasurfaces with efficient use of computational resources.

Conclusion: The developed approach advances the design of chiral photonic metasurfaces with enhanced capabilities for polarization-selective light-matter interactions.

Abstract: Chiral photonic metasurfaces provide unique capabilities for tailoring light-matter interactions, which are essential for next-generation photonic devices. Here, we report an advanced optimization framework that combines deep learning and evolutionary algorithms to significantly improve both the design and performance of chiral photonic nanostructures. Building on previous work utilizing a three-layer perceptron reinforced learning and stochastic evolutionary algorithm with decaying changes and mass extinction for chiral photonic optimization, our study introduces a refined pipeline featuring a two-output neural network architecture to reduce the trade-off between high chiral dichroism (CD) and reflectivity. Additionally, we use an improved fitness function, and efficient data augmentation techniques. A comparative analysis between a neural network (NN)-based approach and a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for structures of different interface pattern depth, material combinations, and geometric complexity. We demonstrate a twice higher CD and the impact of both the corner number and the refractive index contrast at the example of a GaP/air and PMMA/air metasurface as a result of superior optimization performance. Additionally, a substantial increase in the number of structures explored within limited computational resources is highlighted, with tailored spectral reflectivity suggested by our electromagnetic simulations, paving the way for chiral mirrors applicable to polarization-selective light-matter interaction studies.

Result: Meta-GPT demonstrated <3% spectral error, >98% syntactic validity, and successfully generated photonic designs with experimentally validated optical responses.

Conclusion: The study establishes a rigorous AI framework (Meta-GPT and METASTRINGS) for photonics, enabling effective design of metasurfaces and advancing the integration of AI in photonics research.

Abstract: Advancing artificial intelligence for physical sciences requires representations that are both interpretable and compatible with the underlying laws of nature. We introduce METASTRINGS, a symbolic language for photonics that expresses nanostructures as textual sequences encoding materials, geometries, and lattice configurations. Analogous to molecular textual representations in chemistry, METASTRINGS provides a framework connecting human interpretability with computational design by capturing the structural hierarchy of photonic metasurfaces. Building on this representation, we develop Meta-GPT, a foundation transformer model trained on METASTRINGS and finetuned with physics-informed supervised, reinforcement, and chain-of-thought learning. Across various design tasks, the model achieves <3% mean-squared spectral error and maintains >98% syntactic validity, generating diverse metasurface prototypes whose experimentally measured optical responses match their target spectra. These results demonstrate that Meta-GPT can learn the compositional rules of light-matter interactions through METASTRINGS, laying a rigorous foundation for AI-driven photonics and representing an important step toward a metasurface genome project.

### [733] [JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12367)
*Shuyang Xie,Jie Zhou,Jun Wang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The study introduces an efficient cloud-edge holography framework inspired by JPEG to solve computational and bandwidth limitations for augmented/virtual reality devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying neural CGH pipelines on lightweight AR/VR devices is challenging due to computational, energy, and latency constraints, necessitating an efficient and practical solution for holographic data processing and transmission.

Method: The paper designs a learnable transform codec based on JPEG principles, offloading heavy neural processing to the cloud while utilizing lightweight, hardware-friendly decoding on the edge. Custom CUDA kernels are implemented for enhanced throughput.

Result: The proposed system achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at less than 2 bits per pixel, with a decoding latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments validate its reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical, low-latency, and bandwidth-efficient solution for hologram streaming on resource-constrained AR/VR wearable devices using existing hardware capabilities without requiring neural decoders or specialized equipment.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) presents a transformative solution for near-eye displays in augmented and virtual reality. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved CGH in reconstructed quality and computational efficiency. However, deploying neural CGH pipelines directly on compact, eyeglass-style devices is hindered by stringent constraints on computation and energy consumption, while cloud offloading followed by transmission with natural image codecs often distorts phase information and requires high bandwidth to maintain reconstruction quality. Neural compression methods can reduce bandwidth but impose heavy neural decoders at the edge, increasing inference latency and hardware demand. In this work, we introduce JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography, an efficient pipeline designed around a learnable transform codec that retains the block-structured and hardware-friendly nature of JPEG. Our system shifts all heavy neural processing to the cloud, while the edge device performs only lightweight decoding without any neural inference. To further improve throughput, we implement custom CUDA kernels for entropy coding on both cloud and edge. This design achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at $<$ 2 bits per pixel with decode latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments confirm the high reconstruction quality of the holograms. By aligning CGH with a codec that preserves JPEG's structural efficiency while extending it with learnable components, our framework enables low-latency, bandwidth-efficient hologram streaming on resource-constrained wearable devices-using only simple block-based decoding readily supported by modern system-on-chips, without requiring neural decoders or specialized hardware.

### [734] [Complexity of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Generalized Linear Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12748)
*Martin Chak,Giacomo Zanella*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper compares MCMC, Laplace Approximation, and Variational Inference for Bayesian inference, showing that MCMC achieves competitive complexity scaling under broader conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A theoretical understanding of the trade-offs in computational cost and accuracy among MCMC, LA, and VI methods is lacking, especially for large sample sizes and high data dimensions.

Method: The characteristics of MCMC are analyzed for linear, logistic, and Poisson regression under scaling conditions between sample size and dimensions ($n\gtrsim d$). Prior assumptions extend beyond Gaussian-tailed to include Student-t and flat priors.

Result: MCMC achieves complexity scaling in $n$, $d$ comparable to first-order optimization algorithms under conditions more relaxed than the Bernstein-von Mises regimes, covering non-concave and non-gradient-Lipschitz log-posteriors.

Conclusion: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods remain competitive in algorithmic complexity for Bayesian inference under broader conditions than previously established benchmarks, such as Laplace Approximation and Gaussian Variational Inference.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Laplace approximation (LA) and variational inference (VI) methods are popular approaches to Bayesian inference, each with trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy. However, a theoretical understanding of these differences is missing, particularly when both the sample size $n$ and the dimension $d$ are large. LA and Gaussian VI are justified by Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorems, and recent work has derived the characteristic condition $n\gg d^2$ for their validity, improving over the condition $n\gg d^3$. In this paper, we show for linear, logistic and Poisson regression that for $n\gtrsim d$, MCMC attains the same complexity scaling in $n$, $d$ as first-order optimization algorithms, up to sub-polynomial factors. Thus MCMC is competitive with LA and Gaussian VI in complexity, under a scaling between $n$ and $d$ more general than BvM regimes. Our complexities apply to appropriately scaled priors that are not necessarily Gaussian-tailed, including Student-$t$ and flat priors, with log-posteriors that are not necessarily globally concave or gradient-Lipschitz.

### [735] [Flow-matching Operators for Residual-Augmented Probabilistic Learning of Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12749)
*Sahil Bhola,Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for learning probabilistic surrogates for PDEs by introducing a conditional neural operator that maps low-fidelity solutions to high-fidelity ones, enabling resolution invariance and efficient implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning probabilistic surrogates for PDEs in data-scarce regimes, particularly the large data requirements of neural operators and resolution limitations of generative models.

Method: The method combines flow matching in infinite-dimensional function space with a conditional neural operator architecture. It includes a feature-wise linear modulation mechanism, a parameterized flow vector field, and a residual learning strategy to learn probabilistic corrections from low- to high-fidelity solutions.

Result: The method shows accurate learning of solution operators across different resolutions and fidelities. It also provides meaningful uncertainty estimates even in data-scarce high-fidelity training scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient and scalable learning of PDE surrogates in low-data regimes, overcoming challenges of resolution invariance and fidelity gap through innovative architecture and learning strategies.

Abstract: Learning probabilistic surrogates for PDEs remains challenging in data-scarce regimes: neural operators require large amounts of high-fidelity data, while generative approaches typically sacrifice resolution invariance. We formulate flow matching in an infinite-dimensional function space to learn a probabilistic transport that maps low-fidelity approximations to the manifold of high-fidelity PDE solutions via learned residual corrections. We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow-matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical experiments on a range of PDEs, including the 1D advection and Burgers' equation, and a 2D Darcy flow problem for flow through a porous medium.
  We show that the proposed method can accurately learn solution operators across different resolutions and fidelities and produces uncertainty estimates that appropriately reflect model confidence, even when trained on limited high-fidelity data.

### [736] [Diffusion Model-Based Posterior Sampling in Full Waveform Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12797)
*Mohammad H. Taufik,Tariq Alkhalifah*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper improves Bayesian full waveform inversion for subsurface modeling by combining diffusion-based sampling and simultaneous-source data, achieving lower model error and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem with Bayesian full waveform inversion on field-scale seismic data is the prohibitively high computation cost due to sampling via wave-equation solves. This research seeks to make sampling feasible for large-scale surveys while maintaining reliability and calibration, especially in less illuminated areas.

Method: The approach uses diffusion-based sampling combined with simultaneous-source data. Noise levels are refined in model space using Langevin dynamics, and an unconditional prior helps suppress artefacts. Simultaneous-source processing significantly reduces computational workloads.

Result: The new methodology was evaluated on synthetic 2D and real 3D seismic datasets and demonstrated better model accuracy, improved data fitting, and reduced computation times compared to particle-based baselines.

Conclusion: This diffusion-based method provides a scalable and practical solution to uncertainty-aware posterior sampling, enabling more computationally efficient full waveform inversion for large seismic problems.

Abstract: Bayesian full waveform inversion (FWI) offers uncertainty-aware subsurface models; however, posterior sampling directly on observed seismic shot records is rarely practical at the field scale because each sample requires numerous wave-equation solves. We aim to make such sampling feasible for large surveys while preserving calibration, that is, high uncertainty in less illuminated areas. Our approach couples diffusion-based posterior sampling with simultaneous-source FWI data. At each diffusion noise level, a network predicts a clean velocity model. We then apply a stochastic refinement step in model space using Langevin dynamics under the wave-equation likelihood and reintroduce noise to decouple successive levels before proceeding. Simultaneous-source batches reduce forward and adjoint solves approximately in proportion to the supergather size, while an unconditional diffusion prior trained on velocity patches and volumes helps suppress source-related numerical artefacts. We evaluate the method on three 2D synthetic datasets (SEG/EAGE Overthrust, SEG/EAGE Salt, SEAM Arid), a 2D field line, and a 3D upscaling study. Relative to a particle-based variational baseline, namely Stein variational gradient descent without a learned prior and with single-source (non-simultaneous-source) FWI, our sampler achieves lower model error and better data fit at a substantially reduced computational cost. By aligning encoded-shot likelihoods with diffusion-based sampling and exploiting straightforward parallelization over samples and source batches, the method provides a practical path to calibrated posterior inference on observed shot records that scales to large 2D and 3D problems.

### [737] [MicroPhaseNO: Adapting an Earthquake-Trained Phase Neural Operator for Microseismic Phase Picking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13197)
*Ayrat Abdullin,Umair bin Waheed,Leo Eisner,Naveed Iqbal*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using transfer learning to adapt an earthquake phase picking tool, PhaseNO, for microseismic monitoring, demonstrating improved performance on distinct microseismic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating seismic phase picking for microseismic monitoring is needed as manual methods are inefficient for real-time applications and large arrays. While existing deep learning pickers struggle with microseismic datasets, adapting them can overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors use transfer learning to fine-tune the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), pre-trained on earthquake datasets, using a small labeled microseismic dataset to adapt its capabilities for microseismic monitoring.

Result: The adapted PhaseNO model showed significant improvement, with up to a 30% increase in F1 score and accuracy, reduced timing bias, and pick uncertainty when tested on real-world microseismic datasets.

Conclusion: The approach preserves knowledge from large earthquake datasets while tailoring it to microseismic settings, making it transferable to different microseismic tasks. This research offers a practical, automated solution for seismic monitoring.

Abstract: Seismic phase picking is very often used for microseismic monitoring and subsurface imaging. Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing bias and pick uncertainty. Because the adaptation relies on a small, campaign-specific calibration set, the approach is readily transferable to other microseismic tasks where public earthquake data and pre-trained models are accessible. The associated code will be released openly at https://github.com/ayratabd/MicroPhaseNO.

### [738] [Enhancing lithological interpretation from petrophysical well log of IODP expedition 390/393 using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13529)
*Raj Sahu,Saumen Maiti*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The study leverages machine learning (ML) for improved lithological interpretation of well log data, outperforming traditional methods and achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for lithological interpretation are constrained by poor borehole conditions and oversimplistic linear models, often failing with overlapping signals. Given these limitations and the necessity for robust geological resource exploration, this paper focuses on improved data interpretation using ML techniques.

Method: The researchers tested multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, MLP) on multivariate well log data from IODP expeditions. Both supervised and unsupervised ML approaches were applied for enhanced lithology clustering and interpretation.

Result: Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models achieved the best performance with accuracy and F1-scores above 0.995. The study demonstrates the efficacy of ML over traditional methods in handling complex datasets.

Conclusion: The ML-based joint method enhances well log interpretations and offers scalability for application to other global ocean well log datasets. Particularly, accuracy and clustering abilities are significantly improved.

Abstract: Enhanced lithological interpretation from well logs plays a key role in geological resource exploration and mapping, as well as in geo-environmental modeling studies. Core and cutting information is useful for making sound interpretations of well logs; however, these are rarely collected at each depth due to high costs. Moreover, well log interpretation using traditional methods is constrained by poor borehole conditions. Traditional statistical methods are mostly linear, often failing to discriminate between lithology and rock facies, particularly when dealing with overlapping well log signals characterized by the structural and compositional variation of rock types. In this study, we develop multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to jointly analyze multivariate well log data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expeditions 390 and 393 for enhanced lithological interpretations. Among the algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network models, the Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 0.9950 and an F1-score of 0.9951. While unsupervised machine learning (ML) provides the foundation for cluster information that inherently supports the classification algorithm, supervised ML is applied to devise a data-driven lithology clustering mechanism for IODP datasets. The joint ML-based method developed here has the potential to be further explored for analyzing other well log datasets from the world's oceans.

*Sreemaee Akshathala,Bassam Adnan,Mahisha Ramesh,Karthik Vaidhyanathan,Basil Muhammed,Kannan Parthasarathy*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Agent Assessment Framework to evaluate multi-agent AI systems, addressing unique challenges like non-deterministic behavior and runtime uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating agentic AI systems and multi-agent architectures comprehensively, given the limitations of existing evaluation methods for capturing non-deterministic behaviors.

Method: The authors propose a four-pillar evaluation framework—LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment—validated through experiments on an Autonomous CloudOps use case.

Result: The proposed framework effectively captures runtime uncertainties and behavioral variabilities overlooked by traditional binary metrics.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity of comprehensive, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks for agentic AI systems to better understand their behavior and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have shifted the focus from standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrated systems that combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties.

TL;DR: The paper explores AI decision-making in network-effect scenarios, showing how historical data and its structure impact equilibrium outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how AI agents interact in network-driven games and understand the effects of historical data and network effects on their decision-making.

Method: A novel workflow using LLM-based AI agents in repeated decision-making with systematic manipulations of price trajectories and network-effect strengths.

Result: AI agents fail to infer equilibrium without history, achieve partial convergence with ordered histories, and completely fail with randomized ones in strong network contexts.

Conclusion: Equilibrium outcomes in AI-mediated systems are influenced by historical data structure, demonstrating AI's reliance on temporal coherence unlike humans.

Abstract: Understanding decision-making in multi-AI-agent frameworks is crucial for analyzing strategic interactions in network-effect-driven contexts. This study investigates how AI agents navigate network-effect games, where individual payoffs depend on peer participatio--a context underexplored in multi-agent systems despite its real-world prevalence. We introduce a novel workflow design using large language model (LLM)-based agents in repeated decision-making scenarios, systematically manipulating price trajectories (fixed, ascending, descending, random) and network-effect strength. Our key findings include: First, without historical data, agents fail to infer equilibrium. Second, ordered historical sequences (e.g., escalating prices) enable partial convergence under weak network effects but strong effects trigger persistent "AI optimism"--agents overestimate participation despite contradictory evidence. Third, randomized history disrupts convergence entirely, demonstrating that temporal coherence in data shapes LLMs' reasoning, unlike humans. These results highlight a paradigm shift: in AI-mediated systems, equilibrium outcomes depend not just on incentives, but on how history is curated, which is impossible for human.

TL;DR: The study introduces two reinforcement learning-based algorithms to optimize data freshness and transmission in cyber-physical systems, achieving results within 3% of the optimal with lower computational cost than competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of optimizing data freshness (Age-of-Information) for IoT devices in cyber-physical systems in scenarios with unknown transmission and cost characteristics.

Method: The study employs two policy gradient methods within the model-free reinforcement learning framework to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates AoI and transmission costs, adapting to continuous state and action spaces.

Result: The algorithms demonstrate good convergence, achieve time-average costs within 3% of the optimal value, and outperform state-of-the-art methods in broader applicability, cost efficiency, and reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: By leveraging model-free reinforcement learning, the introduced algorithms offer efficient and adaptable solutions to optimize data update policies for improved performance in diverse cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Recent developments in cyber-physical systems have increased the importance of maximizing the freshness of the information about the physical environment. However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the generate-at-will model, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable. A comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed algorithms outperform them in one or more of the following aspects: being applicable to a broader range of scenarios, achieving a lower time-average cost, and requiring a computational cost at least one order of magnitude lower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Volatility forecasting is critical in finance as it directly impacts decisions in banking, investment, and risk management.

Method: A hybrid framework combining Stochastic Volatility models and LSTM neural networks is developed, utilizing a rolling window approach with daily S&P 500 data from 1998 to 2024 to train and evaluate one-step-ahead forecasts.

Result: The hybrid model outperforms singular SV and LSTM models through both statistical testing and investment simulations.

Conclusion: The SV-LSTM hybrid model enhances volatility forecasting, fostering improved risk assessment and strategic financial planning for the S&P 500 context.

Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasting is essential in banking, investment, and risk management, because expectations about future market movements directly influence current decisions. This study proposes a hybrid modelling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short Term Memory neural network. The SV model improves statistical precision and captures latent volatility dynamics, especially in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model's ability to detect complex nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one step ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. The results show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the standalone SV and LSTM models and contributes to the development of volatility modelling techniques, providing a foundation for improving risk assessment and strategic investment planning in the context of the S and P 500.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting, lookahead bias, and reproducibility issues in algorithmic trading research.

Method: The framework includes hypothesis-driven signal generation, reinforcement learning, strict out-of-sample testing, rolling window validation, and realistic scenario constraints.

Result: Testing across 100 US equities yielded modest financial returns with strong downside protection and market-neutral traits, showing regime dependence. Results are statistically insignificant, emphasizing reproducibility and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a reproducible and transparent validation protocol, ensuring interpretability and addressing transparency challenges in quantitative finance research.

Abstract: We develop a rigorous walk-forward validation framework for algorithmic trading designed to mitigate overfitting and lookahead bias. Our methodology combines interpretable hypothesis-driven signal generation with reinforcement learning and strict out-of-sample testing. The framework enforces strict information set discipline, employs rolling window validation across 34 independent test periods, maintains complete interpretability through natural language hypothesis explanations, and incorporates realistic transaction costs and position constraints. Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models. The key empirical finding reveals that daily OHLCV-based microstructure signals require elevated information arrival and trading activity to function effectively. The framework provides complete mathematical specifications and open-source implementation, establishing a template for rigorous trading system evaluation that addresses the reproducibility crisis in quantitative finance research. For researchers, practitioners, and regulators, this work demonstrates that interpretable algorithmic trading strategies can be rigorously validated without sacrificing transparency or regulatory compliance.

*Yuewen Hou,Dhanvi Bharadwaj,Gokul Subramanian Ravi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are expensive due to their iterative, task-intensive nature. TreeVQA reduces these costs by leveraging execution similarities across tasks, achieving substantial reductions in execution shots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQAs possess potential for quantum computing, but their high execution costs hinder practical applications. A strategy to mitigate these costs is needed for scalability.

Method: TreeVQA employs a tree-based execution framework that starts with joint task execution, branching only as executions diverge. It integrates seamlessly with existing VQA applications.

Result: TreeVQA achieved average shot reductions of $25.9\times$, and over $100\times$ for larger problems, while maintaining target accuracy. Efficiency improves with problem size and precision demands.

Conclusion: TreeVQA significantly reduces execution costs for VQAs, facilitating their practical use and scalability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near- and intermediate-term quantum computing, but their execution cost is substantial. Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\times$ on average and over $100\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy. The benefits grow further with increasing problem size and precision requirements.

### [745] [Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692)
*Ciarán M. Gilligan-Lee,Yìlè Yīng,Jonathan Richens,David Schmid*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates how quantum oracles give advantages over classical oracles in solving counterfactual questions in causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of classical oracles and approaches in answering counterfactual questions and identifying unknown causal parameters in causal models.

Method: The authors used quantum oracles to encode causal dependencies and tested their ability to identify causal parameters through coherent query mechanisms, expanding to arbitrary finite cardinalities.

Result: Quantum systems and coherent queries to quantum oracles allowed identification of all causal parameters and two-way joint counterfactuals, with tighter bounds than classical methods.

Conclusion: Quantum systems provided significant advantages for answering counterfactual questions, suggesting quantum oracles are more effective in understanding causal parameters compared to classical oracles.

Abstract: We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.

*Yeray Cordero,Paula García-Molina,Fernando Vilariño*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), which integrates quantum techniques into neural radiance field rendering to address classical limitations in capturing high-frequency details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical implicit neural representations struggle with spectral bias, limiting their ability to model high-frequency details in signals and 3D scenes.

Method: Q-NeRF integrates Quantum Implicit Representation Networks (QIREN) into the Nerfacto backbone, combining classical and quantum methods for efficient and enhanced rendering.

Result: Hybrid quantum-classical models show competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules effectively capturing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance.

Conclusion: Q-NeRF demonstrates the potential of quantum techniques to alleviate spectral bias and lays groundwork for future quantum-enabled 3D scene reconstruction research.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have become a powerful paradigm for continuous signal modeling and 3D scene reconstruction, yet classical networks suffer from a well-known spectral bias that limits their ability to capture high-frequency details. Quantum Implicit Representation Networks (QIREN) mitigate this limitation by employing parameterized quantum circuits with inherent Fourier structures, enabling compact and expressive frequency modeling beyond classical MLPs. In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Results show that hybrid quantum-classical models achieve competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules particularly effective in representing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance. Although current implementations rely on quantum circuit simulators constrained to few-qubit regimes, the results highlight the potential of quantum encodings to alleviate spectral bias in implicit representations. Q-NeRF provides a foundational step toward scalable quantum-enabled 3D scene reconstruction and a baseline for future quantum neural rendering research.

### [747] [Scalable Quantum Error Mitigation with Neighbor-Informed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12578)
*Zhenyu Chen,Bin Cheng,Minbo Gao,Xiaodie Lin,Ruiqi Zhang,Zhaohui Wei,Zhengfeng Ji*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces neighbor-informed learning (NIL), a quantum error mitigation framework that improves accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in noisy quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum noise limits the potential of quantum computing, and current quantum error mitigation approaches struggle with balancing performance, resources, and guarantees.

Method: The paper suggests NIL, leveraging neighbor circuits' noisy outputs to predict ideal outputs using a 2-design training method to generate efficient and accurate training data.

Result: NIL achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods and requires only logarithmic scaling of the training set with large-scale problems.

Conclusion: NIL offers a robust, theoretically sound, and practically efficient framework that enhances quantum error mitigation, advancing nearer to practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: Noise in quantum hardware is the primary obstacle to realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers a promising pathway to enhance computational accuracy on near-term devices, yet existing methods face a difficult trade-off between performance, resource overhead, and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce neighbor-informed learning (NIL), a versatile and scalable QEM framework that unifies and strengthens existing methods such as zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), while offering improved flexibility, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
  NIL learns to predict the ideal output of a target quantum circuit from the noisy outputs of its structurally related ``neighbor'' circuits. A key innovation is our 2-design training method, which generates training data for our machine learning model. In contrast to conventional learning-based QEM protocols that create training circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with uniformly random Clifford gates, our approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the required size of the training set scales only \emph{logarithmically} with the total number of neighbor circuits, enabling NIL to be applied to problems involving large-scale quantum circuits. Our work establishes a theoretically grounded and practically efficient framework for QEM, paving a viable path toward achieving quantum advantage on noisy hardware.

*Stefan Balauca,Ada-Astrid Balauca,Adrian Iftene*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates hybrid quantum-classical architectures, particularly QRNNs and QCNNs, for language modeling, tested on real quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of near-term quantum devices for processing sequential data and developing generative language models.

Method: The study uses hybrid architectures combining parametric quantum circuits with classical projection layers, leveraging multi-sample SPSA for training despite quantum hardware noise.

Result: The models exhibit the ability to learn sequential patterns, with experiments showing trade-offs between circuit depth and trainability on IBM Quantum devices.

Conclusion: This research validates the feasibility of generative quantum NLP models on NISQ devices, with practical insights into hardware noise challenges and training strategies.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical models represent a crucial step toward leveraging near-term quantum devices for sequential data processing. We present Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) as hybrid quantum language models, reporting the first empirical demonstration of generative language modeling trained and evaluated end-to-end on real quantum hardware. Our architecture combines hardware-optimized parametric quantum circuits with a lightweight classical projection layer, utilizing a multi-sample SPSA strategy to efficiently train quantum parameters despite hardware noise. To characterize the capabilities of these models, we introduce a synthetic dataset designed to isolate syntactic dependencies in a controlled, low-resource environment. Experiments on IBM Quantum processors reveal the critical trade-offs between circuit depth and trainability, demonstrating that while noise remains a significant factor, observable-based readout enables the successful learning of sequential patterns on NISQ devices. These results establish a rigorous engineering baseline for generative quantum natural language processing, validating the feasibility of training complex sequence models on current quantum hardware.

### [749] [Scalable branch-and-bound model selection with non-monotonic criteria including AIC, BIC and Mallows's $\mathit{C_p}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12221)
*Jakob Vanhoefer,Antonia Körner,Domagoj Doresic,Jan Hasenauer,Dilan Pathirana*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel bound-based approach for model selection that enhances computational efficiency in identifying optimal models across vast search spaces, significantly outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational challenges and scalability in traditional model selection processes using information criteria, especially with a large number of candidate models.

Method: The authors present a bound-based strategy that facilitates branch-and-bound algorithms capable of handling non-monotonic information criteria, ensuring efficiency in finding optimal models.

Result: The proposed method successfully identifies optimal models with substantial computational speedups; e.g., achieving over 6,000X speedup in tasks involving billions of models.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable, efficient solution to computational bottlenecks in model selection, solving long-standing challenges in the quantitative sciences.

Abstract: Model selection is a pivotal process in the quantitative sciences, where researchers must navigate between numerous candidate models of varying complexity. Traditional information criteria, such as the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Mallows's $\mathit{C_p}$, are valuable tools for identifying optimal models. However, the exponential increase in candidate models with each additional model parameter renders the evaluation of these criteria for all models -- a strategy known as exhaustive, or brute-force, searches -- computationally prohibitive. Consequently, heuristic approaches like stepwise regression are commonly employed, albeit without guarantees of finding the globally-optimal model.
  In this study, we challenge the prevailing notion that non-monotonicity in information criteria precludes bounds on the search space. We introduce a simple but novel bound that enables the development of branch-and-bound algorithms tailored for these non-monotonic functions. We demonstrate that our approach guarantees identification of the optimal model(s) across diverse model classes, sizes, and applications, often with orders of magnitude computational speedups. For instance, in one previously-published model selection task involving $2^{32}$ (approximately 4 billion) candidate models, our method achieves a computational speedup exceeding 6,000. These findings have broad implications for the scalability and effectiveness of model selection in complex scientific domains.

### [750] [Cycles Communities from the Perspective of Dendrograms and Gradient Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12974)
*Sixtus Dakurah*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel frameworks for identifying and comparing topological cycles using dendrogram-based clustering and stratified gradient sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in topological data analysis: identifying and comparing topological features, such as cycles, across objects.

Method: The study proposes two approaches: (1) using dendrogram-based hierarchical clustering with Wasserstein distance for comparing persistence intervals, and (2) extending Stratified Gradient Sampling to learn filter functions that identify distinct cycle communities.

Result: Simulation studies exhibit the discriminative power of dendrograms in identifying cycle communities and the ability of learned filter functions to partition cycles into non-overlapping groups.

Conclusion: These methods provide robust frameworks for hierarchical clustering and topological optimization, enabling better identification of similar topological structures within and across topological objects.

Abstract: Identifying and comparing topological features, particularly cycles, across different topological objects remains a fundamental challenge in persistent homology and topological data analysis. This work introduces a novel framework for constructing cycle communities through two complementary approaches. First, a dendrogram-based methodology leverages merge-tree algorithms to construct hierarchical representations of homology classes from persistence intervals. The Wasserstein distance on merge trees is introduced as a metric for comparing dendrograms, establishing connections to hierarchical clustering frameworks. Through simulation studies, the discriminative power of dendrogram representations for identifying cycle communities is demonstrated. Second, an extension of Stratified Gradient Sampling simultaneously learns multiple filter functions that yield cycle barycenter functions capable of faithfully reconstructing distinct sets of cycles. The set of cycles each filter function can reconstruct constitutes cycle communities that are non-overlapping and partition the space of all cycles. Together, these approaches transform the problem of cycle matching into both a hierarchical clustering and topological optimization framework, providing principled methods to identify similar topological structures both within and across groups of topological objects.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: OmniNovo is a deep learning-based framework for accurately identifying peptides and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) from mass spectrometry data, significantly outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proteomic methods struggle to identify a large portion of modified proteins due to search space limitations and an inability to handle complex or uncharacterized PTMs effectively.

Method: The paper introduces OmniNovo, a deep learning-based framework that learns universal peptide fragmentation rules, integrates mass-constrained decoding, and applies false discovery rate estimation to analyze tandem mass spectra of peptides.

Result: OmniNovo achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, identifying 51% more peptides at a 1% false discovery rate compared to traditional methods. It also successfully identifies modifications at biological sites not seen during training.

Conclusion: OmniNovo provides a significant advancement in proteomics by enabling a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the proteome, uncovering previously undetected modifications and cellular regulatory processes.

Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) serve as a dynamic chemical language regulating protein function, yet current proteomic methods remain blind to a vast portion of the modified proteome. Standard database search algorithms suffer from a combinatorial explosion of search spaces, limiting the identification of uncharacterized or complex modifications. Here we introduce OmniNovo, a unified deep learning framework for reference-free sequencing of unmodified and modified peptides directly from tandem mass spectra. Unlike existing tools restricted to specific modification types, OmniNovo learns universal fragmentation rules to decipher diverse PTMs within a single coherent model. By integrating a mass-constrained decoding algorithm with rigorous false discovery rate estimation, OmniNovo achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, identifying 51\% more peptides than standard approaches at a 1\% false discovery rate. Crucially, the model generalizes to biological sites unseen during training, illuminating the dark matter of the proteome and enabling unbiased comprehensive analysis of cellular regulation.

*Babak Badnava,Jacob Chakareski,Morteza Hashemi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces ElasticVR, a framework for scalable 360 video processing and elastic computation in VR systems integrated with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning mechanisms, achieving significant improvements in PSNR, response time, and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging VR applications require high computation and data rates, necessitating adaptable solutions to handle communication, computation, energy, and user experience trade-offs efficiently.

Method: Introduces ElasticVR incorporating scalable video tiling with edge-client multi-connectivity architectures and two deep reinforcement learning solutions: CPPG (centralized approach) and IPPG (centralized training, decentralized execution).

Result: ElasticVR improves PSNR by 43.21%, reduces response time by 42.35%, and cuts energy consumption by 56.83% compared to non-elastic VR computations.

Conclusion: ElasticVR offers a scalable and efficient solution for emerging VR applications, balancing performance, energy consumption, and quality through its innovative methods and architecture.

Abstract: Diverse emerging VR applications integrate streaming of high fidelity 360 video content that requires ample amounts of computation and data rate. Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations.

### [754] [From Zipf's Law to Neural Scaling through Heaps' Law and Hilberg's Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13491)
*Łukasz Dębowski*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper links the neural scaling law in machine learning with Zipf's law in linguistics, showing that the former arises from the latter under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate how two fundamental empirical laws—neural scaling law in machine learning and Zipf's law in linguistics—are interrelated, improving our theoretical understanding of large models and linguistic patterns.

Method: The paper establishes the connection by deriving intermediate laws (Heaps' law and Hilberg's hypothesis) to show how Zipf's law leads to the neural scaling law. A toy example is used to demonstrate these derivations in action.

Result: The authors confirm that under broad assumptions, Zipf's law systematically leads to the neural scaling law for foundation models, offering a unified explanation of these phenomena.

Conclusion: The work strengthens theoretical insights into neural scaling laws by showing their root in linguistic token distributions, enriching both machine learning and quantitative linguistics perspectives.

Abstract: We inspect the deductive connection between the neural scaling law and Zipf's law -- two statements discussed in machine learning and quantitative linguistics. The neural scaling law describes how the cross entropy rate of a foundation model -- such as a large language model -- changes with respect to the amount of training tokens, parameters, and compute. By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws.

### [755] [Stopping Rules for Stochastic Gradient Descent via Anytime-Valid Confidence Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13123)
*Liviu Aolaritei,Michael I. Jordan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper develops stopping rules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using confidence sequences to ensure $$-optimality throughout the optimization process, providing statistically rigorous guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the lack of statistical validity in assessing SGD's progress at arbitrary times, as classical analyses do not provide any anytime-valid methods for this.

Method: The method uses nonnegative supermartingales to construct a confidence sequence for the suboptimality of projected SGD, avoiding the need for smoothness or strong convexity assumptions.

Result: The study introduces $$-optimality stopping rules that are provable, finite with high probability, and time-uniform for general convex objectives.

Conclusion: This paper provides the first rigorous performance guarantees and time-uniform certificates for projected SGD based on observable trajectory quantities, overcoming limitations in classical methods.

Abstract: We study stopping rules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for convex optimization from the perspective of anytime-valid confidence sequences. Classical analyses of SGD provide convergence guarantees in expectation or at a fixed horizon, but offer no statistically valid way to assess, at an arbitrary time, how close the current iterate is to the optimum. We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-α$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous, time-uniform performance guarantees and finite-time $\varepsilon$-optimality certificates for projected SGD with general convex objectives, based solely on observable trajectory quantities.

TL;DR: The paper presents an enhanced fixed-point framework combining Nesterov's acceleration and KM iteration to approximate fixed points with delayed inexact oracles, achieving improved convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the central problem in scientific computing: approximating fixed points of nonexpansive operators with improved efficiency using delayed inexact oracles.

Method: Combines Nesterov's acceleration and Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration under delayed inexact oracle framework to achieve superior convergence rates.

Result: Achieved $(O(1/k^2))$ expectation and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates, outperforming traditional KM-type methods, validated with numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves convergence rates for fixed-point problems under diverse oracle settings, demonstrating theoretical and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated fixed-point-based framework using delayed inexact oracles to approximate a fixed point of a nonexpansive operator (or equivalently, a root of a co-coercive operator), a central problem in scientific computing. Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-informed regression method that computes predictions directly through constrained optimization, avoiding long training processes required in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve physics-informed regression by offering a computationally efficient, training-free solution that adheres to physical laws, addressing limitations of traditional neural network methods.

Method: The proposed method uses constrained optimization and multivariate Taylor series expansions to predict states, derivatives, and curvature, enforcing physical laws directly without requiring extensive training or pre-training.

Result: The method demonstrated competitive predictive accuracy compared to neural network approaches on a reaction-diffusion system while being computationally efficient and robust to sampling changes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a direct optimization method can provide an effective alternative to neural networks for physics-informed problems, eliminating training requirements and maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of physics-informed regression, and propose a method that directly computes the state at the prediction point, simultaneously with the derivative and curvature information of the existing samples. We frame each prediction as a constrained optimisation problem, leveraging multivariate Taylor series expansions and explicitly enforcing physical laws. Each individual query can be processed with low computational cost without any pre- or re-training, in contrast to global function approximator-based solutions such as neural networks. Our comparative benchmarks on a reaction-diffusion system show competitive predictive accuracy relative to a neural network-based solution, while completely eliminating the need for long training loops, and remaining robust to changes in the sampling layout.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an extension of the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework with Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM) to achieve faster convergence rates for stochastic optimization algorithms under relaxed conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stochastic momentum methods have slow convergence rates (${O}(1/K^{1/4})$) and limited applicability under Euclidean norm settings, which limits their generalization to tasks requiring arbitrary norms.

Method: The paper combines the Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM) approach with the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, enabling theoretical guarantees in relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings, leading to improved convergence rates (${O}(1/K^{1/3})$).

Result: The proposed framework achieves faster convergence rates than traditional methods, validates theoretical improvements, and is experimentally successful in training neural networks like MLPs and LSTMs.

Conclusion: The integration of HCM within LMO shows improved optimization that adapts to problem geometry, thus accelerating both convergence rates and practical performance for deep learning tasks.

Abstract: The use of momentum in stochastic optimization algorithms has shown empirical success across a range of machine learning tasks. Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum. Experimental results on training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks verify our theoretical observations.
