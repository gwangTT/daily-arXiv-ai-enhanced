GPUs offer massive parallelism that can potentially accelerate SPHINCS+ signatures. However, existing GPU-based optimizations either fail to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of SPHINCS+'s Merkle tree structure or lack fine-grained, compiler-level customization across its diverse computational kernels. This paper proposes HERO Sign, a GPU-accelerated SPHINCS+ implementation that adopts hierarchical tuning and efficient compiler time optimizations. HERO Sign reexamines the parallelization opportunities enabled by data independence across SPHINCS+ components, including FORS, MSS, and WOTS+. It introduces a Tree Fusion strategy for FORS, which contains a large number of independent branches. The fusion strategy is guided by an automated Tree Tuning search algorithm that adapts fusion schemes to different GPU architectures. To further improve performance, HERO Sign employs an adaptive compilation strategy that accounts for the varying effectiveness of compiler optimizations across SPHINCS+ kernels such as FORS Sign, TREE Sign, and WOTS+ Sign. During compilation, the strategy automatically selects between PTX and native code paths to maximize efficiency. For batched signature generation, HERO Sign optimizes kernel-level overlapping using a task graph-based construction to reduce multi-stream idle time and kernel launch overhead. Experimental results show that, compared to state of the art GPU implementations, HERO Sign achieves throughput improvements of 1.28-3.13, 1.28-2.92, and 1.24-2.60 under the SPHINCS+ 128f, 192f, and 256f parameter sets on RTX 4090.

Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks.

Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters.

We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters.

However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks.

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications.

Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference.

First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management.

GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family.

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired.

Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second.

We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time.

The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from \"passive detection\" to \"intelligent diagnosis\" for battery safety management.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces BatteryAgent, a framework combining physical features and large language models for advanced lithium-ion battery fault diagnosis, going beyond traditional methods.", "motivation": "Current deep learning methods, despite high accuracy in fault detection for lithium-ion batteries, lack interpretability and fail to offer root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations.", "method": "BatteryAgent integrates three modules: a Physical Perception Layer for mechanism-based features, a Detection and Attribution Layer with Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP, and a Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer using LLMs to provide diagnostics and recommendations.", "result": "The approach achieved an impressive Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.986 and bettered current state-of-the-art methods, enhancing diagnostic clarity and shifting towards multi-type interpretable diagnosis.", "conclusion": "BatteryAgent establishes a move from conventional fault detection to an interpretable hierarchical framework for fault diagnosis and recommendations in battery safety management."}}

Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the \"add passenger\" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components.

Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss.

Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations.

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training.

Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision.

However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process.

While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality.

To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360\u00b0 closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360\u00b0 panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules.

However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B.

These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases.

First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity.

The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region.

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors.

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM).

Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure.

Climate policy is one such domain, and this is particularly urgent for climate change, where opinion is contested and diverse. We investigate how LLMs represent intersectional patterns in U.S. climate opinions. We prompted six LLMs with profiles of 978 respondents from a nationally representative U.S. climate opinion survey and compared AI-generated responses to actual human answers across 20 questions. We find that LLMs appear to compress the diversity of American climate opinions, predicting less-concerned groups as more concerned and vice versa.

Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection.

However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance.

A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations.

In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children.

We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle.

Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling.

At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates.

To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity.

While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front.

This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses quantum generative models' ability to create classically hard distributions but identifies that anticoncentrating distributions, which lead to quantum advantage, are untrainable.
